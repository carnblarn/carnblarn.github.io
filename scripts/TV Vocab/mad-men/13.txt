son  because i feel that way towards you  trudy told us that you were up for  a promotion and you didnt get it or something   i wish she hadnt  now she loves you  and honestly i think you need to take a little focus off your work  this from one of the top salesmen at vicks chemical  when you started talking about that clearasil company you bought  now that was kind of worth bragging about  did you know that theres a surge in adolescents right now  ill tell you sterling cooper  and yours truly would love to help you deliver that message  see now thats what im talking about  the only family and business you should be mixing is the production of a child  and what did trudy say about that  about what  tom loose lips sink ships  i was just saying that work isnt everything you know  its like that song says tend your own garden  what song is that daddy  i dont know   people say it its true  it is true  tend to your own garden that means  you know start growing things  daddy  youre

say that  what woman would he be calling in manhattan  who answers her own phone  married women  lots of women answer their own phones  so hes calling some married woman from my house  while im

learned that kodak still isnt happy  with the campaign for the new slide projector  is any of this sinking in  its true that while simply relaxing  i can get all the benefits of calisthenics  a simple regimen of three 20minute sessions per week  combined with a sensible diet will restore your youthful glow  i love the way it makes me feel  the relaxacizor  its my little secret  thank you annie  one

carlton has been having an affair  really  she was in pieces don i didnt know what to say to her  well what couldyou say  im surprised she told you  why  shes like a sister to me  of course she is  i never liked carlton  he was never my favorite  she should poison him  now you think she should kill him  how could someone do that to the person that they love  that they have children with  doesnt this all mean anything  who knows why people do what they do  come on  bring the wine  its actually a hell of a gadget  continuous doesnt jam  they call it the doughnut or the wheel  theyre expecting something along those lines  kodak reinvented the wheel theyre going to hear that 10 times  they actually want you to use the words research  and development in the ads  but if you could find a way to put the wheel and the future  into something with some legs  you could make me look good my first month here  i never thought it would happen to me  but i regained my youth and my happiness  just ask my husband  i swear he looks at me like the night we met  its true that while simply relaxing  i can get all the benefits of  annie im sorry we have to get a level here  no we dont  she doesnt sound very confident  she just started  give her a direction  okay annie  confidence  okay  i never thought it would happen to me  but i regained my youth and my happiness  just ask my husband  i swear he looks at me like the night we met  annie   yes  are you married  no  i could have told you that  well try and imagine youre you annie  and now you have everything  youre beautiful youre slim  youre the beloved prize of a handsome man  and you have everything when you use the relaxacizor  its too bad your voice is so annoying  i never thought it would happen to me  but i regained my youth and my happiness  just ask my husband  hold on annie we have a problem with the tape recorder  say something to her  make her feel beautiful  you know the confidence that comes with beauty  pegs a woman who looks like that will never sound confident  because she never is confident    annie has guts to give the bachelor  the juiciest gazelle is the easiest to catch  can i i have a bit of a cold in my throat  can i get some pineapple juice  theres a glass of water in the corner  its great for your throat  i didnt believe that either  lets try it again annie  happy confident beautiful  i never thought it would happen to me  but i regained my youth and my happiness  just ask my husband  i swear he looks at me like the night  annie  youre married  maybe you put on a few pounds  but then you got the relaxacizor  and youre back to being you  right now  i dont know that i understand  annie what dont you understand  l am being me  just give me a second ill get it the way you want it  i never

mrs albertson i have warned you this is inappropriate  are we on fire  don  no i  dropped a cigarette in my waste basket  harry come here i want to talk to you  harry i want to talk to you  i can explain  what is the benefit of that thing  it sells projectors to people who already have them  yeah the wheel  stacks you store your slides in it  and its ready to go  i took pictures for the paper at wisconsin  the machinery is definitely part of the fun  its mechanical  what did you take pictures of  girls mostly  you could go up and ask them their names afterwards  like you were going to put it in the paper  and some other stuff artsycraftsy stuff  think of it hell about it  artsy like what  like the reflection of a tree in a pond  worse  i did a whole series that was just  handprints on glass  you know the way it fogs up around your heat  and take it off take a picture  black and white i suppose  of course  i was always fascinated by the cave paintings of lascaux  theyre like 17000 years old  the bison get all the attention  but there are also all of these handprints  tiny by todays standards  with paint blown all around them  signature of the artist  but i thought it was like someone  reaching through the stone and right to us  i was here  are you okay  thatll be all  glen  im not supposed to talk to you  who says who said that  my mother and my father  i dont care  my mothers going to come out  i dont care  glen  i cant talk to anyone  its so horrible  im so sad  dont cry  please  please tell me ill be okay  i dont know  i wish i was older  adults dont know anything glen  i dont really know how long 20 minutes is  of course dear  don i hope im not bothering you  i just wanted to let you know i took ducks talk very seriously  and without having to crack my deerfield yearbook  ive brought in an account  good for you  its a piece of vicks chemical company  clearasil  better potential than any traditional pharmaceutical i believe  thats a real account campbell  howd that happen  im not embarrassed to say my fatherinlaws  a former salesman now executive there  thats generous  hes interested in my future  congratulations im sure with a little bit of lawyering  youre entitled to that bonus  i got the bonus  and cooper gave me some book by ayn rand  he seemed assured as i hope you are  that i have a significant investment in this company  well you do now dont you  it matters to me that youre impressed  i am  selfworth and status  you said it  thanksgiving  its very nnervewracking having to deal with getting  the family together  my mother didnt  cook last year because she was so sick  and now im going to have to deal with gloria  but it is thanksgiving and  im grateful for things  like this  this has helped  don doesnt think so but it has  being able to talk  just just me and you and your little pad  it has helped  still i  i cant help but think that i would be happy  if my husband was faithful to me  my brothers children are very badly behaved and  he spanks them  don has never laid a hand on the kids  hes kind inside  but outside it  its all there in my face every day  the hotel rooms  sometimes perfume  or worse  he doesnt know what family is  he doesnt even have one  it makes me sorry for him  when in fact i  i should be angry  very angry you know  but i put up with it like some ostrich  its interesting isnt it  the way he m  he makes love  sometimes its what i want  but sometimes its obviously what someone else wants  i suppose it means im not enough  but maybe it  its just him  don draper and salvatore romano  this is joe harriman and lynn taylor  no eastmans today unfortunately theyre all back in the lab  its a wonderful facility but they dont take vacations  what do they show slides of them working  so have you figured out a way to work the wheel into it  we know its hard because wheels arent really seen as exciting  technology even though they are the original  technology is a glittering lure  but theres the rare occasion when the public can be engaged  on the level beyond flash  if they have a sentimental bond with the product  my first job  i was inhouse at a fur company with this old pro  copyrighter a greek named teddy  and teddy told me the most important idea in advertising  is new  creates an itch  you simply put your product in there as a kind of  calamine lotion  but he also talked about  a deeper bond with the product  nostalgia  its delicate  but potent  sweetheart  teddy told me that in greek  nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound  its a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone  this device  isnt a space ship  its a time machine  it goes backwards forwards  it takes us to a place where we ache to go again  its not called the wheel  its called the carousel  it lets us travel the way a child travels  around and around and back home again  to a place where we know we are loved  good luck at your next meeting  don i have to warn you im not alone  it was beautiful  congratulations mein kommandant  they called from the lobby  they cancelled their other meetings including ddb  not just a victory for us its a victory for civilization
