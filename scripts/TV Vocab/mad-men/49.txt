your exhusband donald draper has requested  security clearance regarding business with the united states government  and its our job to confirm his application   oh  its a routine background check  so you see theres no reason to be nervous  no of course  do you mind if i get my cigarettes  of course not  so mrs francis  you were married to donald draper for how long   11 years  and in general  would you describe him as a man of integrity  we divorced we obviously had differences  no of course do you recall  any of the magazines or newspapers  mr draper read when you were married  anything that struck you as radical or subversive in nature  no he read but mostly for work  did he belong to any clubs or organizations  nnnew york athletic club  would you describe him as loyal  excuse me  by that we mean anything that might have  given you doubts about mr drapers allegiance to the united states  any possible ties or sympathies to the communist party   or the soviet union  no nothing like that  so do you have any reason to believe  mr draper isnt who he says he is  what was that im sorry  its a standard question  i know it sounds funny  no  its mrs francis are you in  ill take it  and megan can you check on those tickets  of course   hello  i just spent 40 minutes   with two men from the government  what  couldnt you have at least given me some warning  betts i dont know what
