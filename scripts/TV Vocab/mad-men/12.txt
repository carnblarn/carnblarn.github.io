reporting it to building security  striking resemblance to broderick crawford  peggy olsen highway patrol  ive read three different newspapers with three different results  im sure you know something i dont  i just spent the night literally in a smokefilled  room at the waldorf with every republican luminary  save macarthur and jesus  theres been widespread fraud  daley gave joe kennedy every corpse in cook county  otherwise nixon wins  it shouldnt have been at close  but it is it always is  those jingles  when they got frank sinatra  i knew they would close the gap  so what does he do now  walk away concede  a recount in illinois alone means 30 days  without a president you dont want to win like at  but you want to win  he got 50 of the vote maybe more  this way he lives to see another day   what happens  neil from pg said  if kennedy is willing to buy an election  hes probably willing to play ball with us  the optimism of the american corporation  its a football game to them   doesnt seem fair  fair  very good  where do you think youre going  if i were you i would be very very careful from now on  about the way you speak to me  can i help you  whats that  its yours it came to me by mistake  well thanks  have you reconsidered my qualifications for the head of account services  would it disappoint you if i told you it hadnt crossed my mind  i feel strange having to talk to you in this way  spit it out campbell  i know that your name is not donald draper  its dick whitman  i dont know who donald draper is  but according to my friend russ at the department of defense  dick whitman died in korea in 1950  and donald draper dropped off the map  although hes 43 years old in which case  you look remarkably good   thats kind of elaborate  really  i wish i knew more  i bet a lot of people do  get out   youre making a fool of yourself  you can deny it  but i know its true i can see from your face  you should leave  you should think about how bert cooper will react  when he hears this information  what information  youre not who you say you are  and theres obviously a reason  come on  i would like you to reconsider my qualifications  you said everything except or else  assuming this information is true which it isnt  it sounds to me like youre blackmailing me  im not  im hoping youll realize  that this all can be forgotten  its not like youre a deserter is it  when you threaten someone in this manner  you should be aware of the fact that if your information  is powerful enough to make them do what you want  what else can it make them do  its very simple and its not a threat its just a job  think about it  whitman  yes sergeant  what is this  this is it  one im supposed to have 20  this is going to take a month and it should take 4 hours  well youre whining to the wrong guy sir  at ease  this is for officers  you can bunk next door  id introduce you to the men but youre looking at the complete company  where is everybody sir  they were gone when i got here  im an engineer  theyre in some action  you want to go  the answer is no  the locals stopped showing up three days ago  which by the way is not good  youre going to be doing all the digging   digging what  well this unit thats you  will be establishing a field hospital but first were  going to be digging fighting positions on four sides  what are you doing here  are you poor   i volunteered  youre kidding me  well they got me with college  but im three years six months nearly a civilian  im supposed to be building swimming pools not latrines  you any good with that rifle  i wouldnt want you to mistake me for chinese  much practice as ive had yes  what misconception traveled down the road and made you want to be here   a movie  no i just wanted to leave  ill bet youre reconsidering if this was a step up  miss menken  mr draper is here to see you  please hold my calls  did you run over youre flushed  lets go away  really where   anywhere  warmer weather  sure  how about los angeles  mexico i have money  i have money but i have a store to run  don are you well   no im not  did something else happen to roger  no  something happened and  i want to go and i want you to come with me  and i dont want to come back   what happened  what does it matter  isnt this what you want  of course ive thought about it  my god weve talked about it  i just  i just didnt think it would happen i mean especially this way  i just  dont want to be without you and i dont want to be here  i cant just leave   maybe this weekend  rachel  no this isnt how i thought it would be  what is the difference  well go somewhere else well start over like adam and eve  what are you 15 years old  my father   cant we be together here  theres nothing here  what about your children  ill provide for them  and live in los angeles  my god you havent thought this through  i feel sick  youre wrong i know exactly what i want  you want your children to go on without a father you know how that felt  are you having an attack of conscience after all this  no im watching you talk because i feel i dontnow you  you know more about me than anyone  you wont even tell me what happened  why are you doing th to me  what kind of man are you  go away drop everything leave your life  people do it every day  this was a dalliance   a cheap affair  rachel dont  you dont want to run away with me  you just want to run away  youre a coward  please go now  get out  peggy this is my office does this door mean nothing to you  im sorry mr draper  i didnt know you were coming back i just  i just  calm down  stop it  i didnt mean to yell at you  got to be some semblance of privacy left here  i had to get away from them all for a minute  drink this  sonny from the elevator  and some janitor i dont know his name  they got fired  thats why youre crying  it was my fault  i called security  they werent even here last night  peggy i need to be alone right now  i know  i know  i dont understand  i try to do my job  i follow the rules  and people hate me  innocent people get hurt and  and other people  people who are not good  get to walk around doing whatever they want  its not fair  finish it  ive thought about what you said  glad to hear it  and then i thought about you  and what a deep lack of character you have  i can understand your frustation don  im not enjoying this any more than you are  im hiring duck phillips   dont make me go to cooper  im not making you do anything  you havent thought this through   i have  really  youre just going to go up to the office and tell bert cooper  if i have to   i dont want to  let me ask you  how do you think hell react when you tell him this story of yours  you expect him to promote you   after the way youve behave  i think hell appreciate the loyalty  you havent thought this through  i dont know  but im pretty sure you wont be working here anymore  what are you doing where are you going  im going to take care of this right now  is this like in the movies where i have a gun  and you dont think im going to shoot you  i will shoot you  i wont let you hold this over my head  so youd rather blow yourself up than make me head of accounts  why cant you give me what i want  ive earned this job i deserve it  why because your parents are rich  because you went to prep school and have a 500 haircut  youve been given everything youve never worked  for anything in your life  for gosh sakes dont you realize youre going to lose everything  im giving you a way out  would it be so bad why is this so hard for you  you really going to do this  more bad news  if you came here to drown your sorrows  im not really much of a drinker  no i just wanted to say  im pulling the trigger on duck phillips as new head of account services  good  well done  what  i have to bring this up to you  only because i believe if i kept it from you  in the end it would be damaging to sterlingcooper  it has come to my attention  completely by accident that donald draper here  is not who he says he is  his real name is dick whitman  but  dick whitman died in korea ten years ago  it stands to reason that  he is a deserter at the very least and who knows what else  mr campbell  who cares   what  who cares  mr cooper hes a fraud a liar a criminal even  even if this were true who cares  this country was built and run by men with worse stories  than whatever youve imagined here  im not imaging anything  the japanese have a saying  a man is whatever room he is in  and right now donald draper  is in this room  i assure you  theres more profit in forgetting this  id put your energy into bringing in accounts  fire him if you want  but id keep an eye on him  one never knows how loyalty is born   sir what do we do  keep your head  dont shoot at anything unless it shoots at you first  what  shut up just stay down  do they know  hospital  were nuts if they know that   is it over  i dont know   you think theyll be back  i dont know  we didnt shoot back that helps  you pissed yourself  what  did i  how are we doing lieutenant draper  on behalf of the president of the united states  and the citizens of the united states of america  i present you with this purple heart medal  the concussion was minor youll feel like yourself in a week  the colonel here has some good news for you  were releasing you to the reserves for your last 80 days  youre going home  thats good news youre going to be okay  lieutenant draper private whitman  you were the last person who knew him in his chain of command  wed like you to take him home  i think it would mean something  lieutenant hayes how are you doing  on behalf of the president of the united states  and the citizens of the united states of america  this is us lieutenant  lieutenant draper  just go  i cant  there he is i see him  who  dick hes on the train i see him  no hes right here  but i saw him   i saw him in the window over there  stop it  no more of that  it must be hard for you  did you know him  a little  you got your whole life ahead of you  forget that boy in the box  look at you  let me buy a soldier a drink  my congratulations  to senator kennedy for his fine race  in this campaign and to all of you
