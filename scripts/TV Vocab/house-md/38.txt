   what did you do to her   original airdate fox 4 apr2006  cuddy called  i know saw the caller id  young girl anaphylactic shock  you answered  turns out thats what stops the ringing  its a weird case  i thought you did the dishes last night  it was your day  i did those are new  midnight snack  for a midnight snack you made a pot roast  the same pot roast i made last night  yeah actually it was after midnight  today is your day right  you want me out of here i get it  no its fine if you stay  the place i was gonna move the guy never called   otherwise ill already be there  i said its fine if you stay  yeah thats why youre making me miserable  maybe i just want to make sure you do your fair share around here  tha  whats weird about it  the girl with the allergies  yeah   shes immunocompromised  what are you doing  what you asked me  you knew that i was interested  that gives you a valuable bargaining chip  you couldve had me doing dishes for a week  okay  the allergic reaction happened while she was in a clean room  why does she have a clean room in her home  heart transplant immune systems in the toilet  mommy builds her little angel a john travoltaquality bubble  six months after the transplant she doesnt need to be confined to a clean room  six months without putting out dr cuddy doesnt need to wear thong panties but  its not our call  i was wondering when youd get around to my panties  shes had four days of workups  theyve tested everyone who came anywhere near that room everything in the room  its like an agatha christie mystery  maybe its not what was there its what she was doing  exercise allergy love it  what sort of exercise could a strapping young man and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly  mom was in the room within seconds  so the boyfriend brought in an allergen and is lying about it  or the girl snuck out and shes lying about that  or the parents are lying about the room being clean  these are your big ideas  somebodys lying  hasnt let me down yet  recheck  mom dad the girl the boy the room and the home  any of you have a new soap detergent perfume  no barbaras really careful about that stuff  and you havent been outside recently  how could i im trapped up there  youre not trapped its just safe  they wont even tell me the alarm code  just tell her i can go back to school  till we clear this up  fine  find out what im allergic to and ill stay away from it  then i can go back to school right  its up to your parents  but medically theres no reason  told you  could i speak to you outside for a second please  you know this is hard enough without you in there giving  she asked my opinion  she is 16 years old lie to her  when i was eight my mom she hated  i  know ii need to loosen up  im overprotective i saw finding nemo i get it  i  dont need another story  but youre not just being overprotective  youre one of the most overprotective parents ive ever seen  she has the best private tutors  i let her friends visit im not going to apologize  just giving you my thoughts  she almost died three times during her childhood  penicillin bee stings peanuts  ive seen her file  six month ago we leave her home alone for the first time on a weekend  she goes out buys one chocolate chip cookie  peanut butter in the dough  shes forgotten her epi pen she drives to the hospital passes out has an accident  steering wheel crushed her chest  she ended up losing her heart  so when you say to me  that im one of the most overprotective parents youve seen please  please introduce me to the ones who were more protective  so that i can find out what theyre doing right  shes allergic to having a sucky social life  give the parents a break theyre just trying to keep her healthy  everything in heres labeled hypoallergenic  check it anyway  cameron  this place is cleaner than her hospital room  no alarm on this window  its 20foot drop  you can get to the tree from here theres some bark scraped off  sure hearttransplant girl swung down there on a vine  maybe she was hooking up with tarzan and cheetah down by the elephant graveyard  orjane stayed in the tree house and tarzan came up  okay um i spent most of the night friday  but if her mom finds out about that she will totally freak  you guys had sex  yeah but you know i did everything i could to make sure she wouldnt get sick  a latex allergy  what do you mean like a condom we didnt  you had unsafe sex  the whole unsafe thing didnt tell you something  yeah but we didnt like plan on it you know it just  i dont know were in love weve been dating for two years  practically a lifetime  how about a semen allergy  were gonna need a semen sample  you can use the bathroom over there  right uh how do i  aim and shoot  no thinking about dr cameron well know  we should tell her parents  why stop there call the cops  melindas a minor  and if we nip it in the bud here teenagers will never again have sex  the parents will find out when they get the bill anyway  oh so youre fine with them finding out as long as you dont have to tell them personally  pretty much  too bad its not you giving the sample  wed be done by now  test was negative no semen allergy  boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on the night before the anaphylaxis  i dont buy that its unrelated  he loves her did everything he could to make sure she wouldnt get sick  what does that mean  love is an emotion certain people experience similar to happiness  no maybe i should give a more relatable example  oh snap  what did he do to protect her  brillopad his privates   i assumed he washed and he  oh good work  assumptions are so much faster than actual questions  house you the boyfriend  need to borrow you  what is going on  dont worry ill return him in roughly the same condition  do you take anything to stay healthy  something stronger than an apple a day  is he okay  hes just tired from being in a coma so long  whatd you take  dont worry he can keep a secret  antibiotics  penicillin  any of those names ring a bell  yeah uhmy friend elliot his dad had like a whole bottle that he hadnt finished so  i swiped it and took a bunch for like a week  theres no way i was gonna risk breathing germs on melinda  this is the one downside of teenage sex  youre idiots  you almost killed your girlfriend  shes allergic to penicillin  what do you think there was still some on my lips  i brushed my teeth  think lower and more fun  i mean it can  it can go through your stuff  totally dude  theres this administrator here whenever she gets sick she just gives me the prescription  but you know they tested melinda they saidshe wasnt allergic to my stuff  yeah four days later  by that time the penicillin was crusting up a sock at the bottom of your hamper  do you have to tell her it was my fault  no  great part of being a grownup you never have to do anything  youre releasing her  what happened what did you find out  tests on your house ruled out any environmental allergens  yeah but what caused this  we believe its highly unlikely that this set of circumstances will repeat itself  what set of circumstances  its good news shes healthy   but you might want to talk  cameron   i cant breathe  getting the epi  lewis give her the shot  no murmurs no friction rubs   what are you waiting for  quiet  shes coughing up white sputum  crackling twothirds of the way up  look at her neck  please she is vomiting would you give her the shot  its not an allergy its her heart  whats the good news whats the bad news  congestive heart failure  is which   good news  why  i dont know it just sounded like you  new puzzle piece always good news whats the bad news  weve got two puzzle pieces from two different puzzles  seems that way  what if her anaphylaxis wasnt anaphylaxis  toxicity from the antirejection meds could cause a seizure and then heart failure  and get cured by a mommywielded epi pen its anaphylaxis what else  what if they really are two puzzles  you think she had two unrelated rare conditions in one week   we explained the anaphylaxis  what do you mean we i did  at least i thought i did maybe i didnt  still it was all me  heart problems arent so rare for someone whos had a heart transplant  i say we assume house was right about the anaphylaxis  it is tempting  heart failure could be either infection coronary disease or rejection  sorry theres a reason they call it the white board  its not my rule  what ties both these conditions together  okay we can all stare at each other or we can investigate what caused the heart failure  just the heart failure  you wanna give me that black marker  theres no fever so its probably not infection  or no fever because shes been on immunosuppressants for the last six months  lets do a ct get a heart biopsy and redo the blood work   anything  not yet  so i hear you dont want teenagers having sex  teen suicide rate isnt high enough for you already  i just think those two are brats  the girl undercuts her mother any chance she gets  yeah its the daughters fault has nothing to do with mom infantilizing her  good point  explains why parents who dont pay attention get such nice welladjusted children  whats this  think its vegetation  yeah  the kind made of muscle that opens your heart valves  its nothing  shes clean  its good news you dont show any signs of coronary artery disease  so  whats next  well blood work to rule out infection  and then a heart surgical biopsy to rule out rejection  but you dont think youre gonna rule out both things do you  n o  im gonna lose this heart right  hopefully well find the problem and fix it  youll keep your heart a long time  how long  well there could be drug breakthroughs that allow you to keep it for decades more   yeah  thats the answer my cardiologist always gives me  i looked it up on the web  its like five or ten years right  thats about the average  thats why i need to have a life  why cant you convince my mom to let me go back to school  melinda youve got bigger worries right now than missing school  until we figure out whats wrong with your heart the safest place for you to be is right here  pain in my heart by otiss reddings   pain in my heart    is treating me poor    where can my baby be    lord no one knows    pain in my heart    just wont let me sleep    where can my baby be    lord where can she be    and now the days    has begin to get tough    said i want you to come back    come back come back baby    ive had enough ohoh  wheres the hooker i assume  right up here buddy  you said youd hang the stethoscope if you were having sex  i didnt say it had to be with another person  can you think of anything that would tie together anaphylaxis and heart failure  no  i was waiting out there for hours  i need a lot of foreplay  and then theres the cuddling afterwards  any  way that anaphylaxis isnt anaphylaxis even it responds to epi  no oh no wonder you were in the mood  this months new jersey journal of cardiology  have you seen the centerfold  theres no way those valves are real  any chance that the heart failure could be unrelated to  no if you need time alone to work  you just have to say so you dont have to lie about it   lyings more fun  being lied to not as much fun  please have an answer to this question  whats for dinner  wilson you still havent done the dishes  you want one of these i think i got a couple of blueberries  nope sorry just one  oh dont look all weepy  you got a problem with me deal with it  short my sheets or something      biopsy was negative for rejection  thank god  and what about the blood tests  showed no infection  so we still dont know what caused her heart failure  lets just be happy she doesnt need a new heart  mrs bardach it could have just been a onetime thing  so she has an allergic reaction and heart failure  and neither of them can be explained  are they doing any more tests on her   no  shes not here  notify local hospitals cab companies the state troopers and local cops  any security officers off duty are back on duty  woman were on it  and im going to need some pictures and go through those drawers  and i want at least two people going over the surveillance tapes  that work  are those all her clothes  uh yeah  shes obviously still in the building  so where did she go what does she want  see her boyfriend  she didnt take her phone  she wants to be outside  if youre trying to scare your parents great job  can we go back now  i hate her  when i was eight years old i was sick   not really sick but the point is my mom she  she was like this before  home by 900 every night cant go out on the weekends cant do sports   transplant just gave her what she always wanted  melinda  you had heart failure  this is kind of an insane time to be criticizing your mom about being overprotective  i know i mean this is what makes it even worse all of her craziness it just  it makes sense now  everythings gonna be all right  i didnt even try to get outside  i was too scared  come on  whoa whoa melinda please walk back towards me  why  please  it feels kind of weird  its called steppage gait  lewis is it serious  no not necessarily  all right stick your leg out hold it up  she was under anesthesia for the biopsy if she lost oxygen  ct ruled out brain damage  put your leg down relax  why is her leg twitching like that  fasciculation  is that serious  its paralysis and its ascending  shes going to lose the use of her legs  to start with  its ascending fast she can hardly extend her leg now  at this rate itll be up to her lungs in a matter of days  so anaphylaxis heart failure paralysis  couldnt put the first two together im guessing we cant put all three together  tick paralysis  could also explain the anaphylaxis maybe even the  penicillin allergy explains the allergic reaction much better  particularly because tick paralysis is usually accompanied by a tick  we did two comprehensive physicals looking for insect bites  can we put any two of those together  how about we stipulate  you argued that there must be something to connect all three symptoms  you mocked us for not figuring it out and finally you let us discuss the paralysis  on its own because its whats gonna kill her  now its ascending  her mris are clean so rule out stroke or aneurysm   als ms  progressions too quick   spinal lesion from leukemia  too slow  its most likely guillainbarre  shes immunosuppressed what about botulism  not unless shes been walking around on her hands the last couple of days  botulism paralysis is descending not ascending  could be a virus  west nile even polio with her immune system shot  get an lp and do pcrs for the viruses  and get an emg to check for guillainbarre  foremans right we gotta find out why shes paralyzed  but not before staring at me dumbly for a few seconds  foreman we ran more tests on your daughter  we took a lumbar puncture got some spinal fluid  then we brought her to the lab to look for infections that could be affecting her brain  we also did an emg to check how her muscles and nerves are responding to electrical impulses  unfortunately her muscles are showing increased weakness above the knee  you mean shes getting worse  the lp and pcrs ruled out polio and west nile  we think its guillainbarre  the bodys immune response goes haywire and starts attacking the peripheral nerves  it causes muscle weakness and paralysis  how bad is it  its serious but guillainbarre usually responds very well to plasmapheresis  foreman you see the plasma the clear liquid part of her blood  contains most of the antibodies which are overreacting and attacking her nervous system  the machine spins her blood in a centrifuge and separates parts of the blood based on weight  white blood cells are the heaviest then the red cells then platelets and plasma  we discard the stuff thats causing all the trouble and return the good blood cells back to her body in a replacement fluid  if it works well see results in a couple of days  you didnt get any messages for me last week did you  nope  thats funny  the guy finally called back the place i lost  he said he left three voice mails  gotta pee  which i never got if that wasnt clear  he must be lying  you wouldnt want to live with a liar   you erased my messages  yup  decided i wanted you to stay  told you that didnt i  youremiserable and youre lonely and youre gonna trap me here to keep me every bit as miserable and lonely too   yeah and youre happy happy happy  okay  hey im obviously going through a rough patch here  wife leaves tends to bum somebody out  do you know where my pee went  youre missing some  no came out of me and went right into the toilet  now why would that be  youre william tell  you could pick an apple off someones head  no its because there was no clear plastic wrap over the toilet  stuffs in the kitchen you have plenty of time all that was missing was the will  this isnt a college dorm  it could be  were not 18  so what  what did i do to you  i scammed you into doing the dishes i made you sit on the steps  i didnt kill your puppy  i did not make you miserable  oh so this is therapy  no its just makes me smile  all right im finding a new place tomorrow  right but not tonight   well i figure you wanna shave my eyebrows while im asleep  i wouldnt wanna deprive you of that last smile  youre not going anywhere  youre gonna sit on my couch  and depress us both because you just cant admit that its over with your wife  thats right im here on vacation  have you gotten a lawyer yet   thatsthats not  you even called one  as long as youre here its just a fight  as soon as you get a place then its a divorce  everything sucks  might as well find something to smile about  reflexes are marginally weaker  the paralysis is getting worse  sometimes it takes a few treatments for the plasmapheresis to work  why do these things keep happening to me  dans back  hey baby did you hear that dans here  i dont want to see him  ill tell him to come back later  no  mommy stay here please  of course    is she okay  shes sleeping  im sure shes exhausted  mood swings are common with the antirejection meds  no shes had mood swings this isnt it this is  shes given up  i know you think im  this isnt what i wanted  shes always fought with me  ever since she was a baby she was so damn stubborn  but i never wanted her like this  i just wanted her safe  doctor doctor   she cant breathe  she couldnt get a whole sentence out  shes using accessory muscles   02 sats down to 90 lungs clear  yeah  does your tongue feel swollen is it itchy  no hives  its not an allergy  lips are cyanotic we got to intubate  what are you doing  pushing lorazepam  shes not getting enough oxygen weve got to assist her breathing  what was that was that a reaction to the treatment  its the paralysis  its reaching her lungs  chase melindas dying  were all dying  how fast  too fast for guillainbarre  cuddy wants to get her an mri to rule out a spinal lesion  cuddy whats shedoing on this  the family lost confidence in us  i dont blame them  ill be right in  its like she got poisoned with a nerve agent  glue inhalation would explain why she hasnt admitted it  tox screen was clear for pot  middleclass heart transplant patients gonna huff glue  pesticides  cameron this time of year theyre not spraying  this girls tough  she gets what she wants  shes deprived of human contact she gets herself a backdoor man  or in her case a side window boy what else has she been deprived of  shes on a special diet because of her allergies  the boyfriend brings the hot beef he also brings a side dish botulism  this is paralysis is ascending remember  not if the heart problems really a paralytic problem  why would she admit the sex and not the food  she didnt admit anything  he admitted the sex and we didnt ask him about food  get me a rat   you have a rat  what  im not gonna kill steve  only way to confirm this  inject the rat with her blood and wait for it to get all botulistic on your ass  in the meantime im going downstairs to browbeat a scared dying teenage girl until she  breaks down like a scared dying teenage girl   youre up early  cuddy needed a consult  were checking for spinal lesions from leukemia  yeah i know fits perfectly  unless this is the patient with the anaphylaxis the heart failure   and the paralysis in which case youre wasting your time  we wanted a second opinion  second we must have given you at least eight  okay well heres nine  botulism  listen to me have you eaten anything abnormal   any canned foods  no  you sure lying to your parents is usually the right thing to do but there is an impending death exception  dont talk to her like that  youre right she never lies i was being rude  when your boyfriend snuck in on friday night  surprise  perhaps he got you some sexy little treats huh  some honey or some edible underwear some massage oils come on anything   we didnt  yeah yeah we know about the sex  turns out that dannys little danny is full of penicillin  thats what caused your anaphylactic shock  you didnt tell us thats what  it was he took clindamycin what i use  he said he was on penicillin  i saw the bottle  its a nonpenicillin antibiotic  if the antibiotics didnt cause the anaphylaxis  its still on the table  everything is connected  what did we discuss what was the differential  cameron said  when dan came to your house that night did he go through any tall grass  climbed a fence  what are you doing  your daughter had two visitors on friday night  one of them is still in the room  she has tick paralysis  dan tracked a tick onto his jeans  which wouldnt be a problem but being a teenager  dan couldnt keep his tick in his pants  foreman we already checked her  now im checking her  tick bites dont ordinarily cause anaphylactic shock  this girls allergies are not ordinary  house get out of here we have to reintubate her get her into the mri  the time course is perfect  the bite itself sets off an allergic reaction  venom takes four days to kick in hearts vulnerable hits that first  and a day later sets off the ascending paralysis  except that ticks arent usually invisible  they are until you find them  oh no thats dandruff that wasnt nearly as dramatic as id hoped  just means the next time itll be even better    whats happening  thats the tick venom ascending  that or you stressed her into heart failure bps dropping   heart rate 47  im administering atropine  shes going to need a transvenous pacing wire  okay magical tick hunt is over  only real doctor stuff now  this is just gonna get worse  ticks produce more toxins the longer they feed  shes gonna be dead in an hour even if you pump her heartfull of jet fuel  unless you let me find the tick  could he be right  the only thing i know for sure is that your daughters heart wont last another 20 minutes without treatment  okay i just need one final instruction  when i find the tick on the autopsy do you want to know  im thinking not probably make the coping easier  stop talking to them  page borsisky in cardiology get her team down here stat  get them out of here get house out of here too  dr wilson i could use your help  well i dont know if the dopamines enough  she may need inamrinone lactate  why whats that she doesnt  she might need stronger pressors they dont have any in radiology  inamrinone can cause arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia  not inamrinone could cause death deaths worse  we have to get her up to the icu  sorry little crowded here  house get out of the elevator  youre welcome to wait for the next one  you got her  got her     well as long as were stuck here this might be a good time to look for that tick  turn the elevator back on  just be a minute honey     atropines wearing off   so inject her again  thats just temporary  temporarys fine were not hanging wallpaper  weve got to get her upstairs and put her on norepinephrine  it wasnt penicillin  you still think the symptoms are unconnected  weve got to take care of her heart before  you wake up in the morning your paints peeling your curtains are gone  and the waters boiling which problem do you deal with first   house  none of them the buildings on fire  we treat her symptoms she dies  we find the cause she lives  that tick is an iv drip of poison we unhook it shell be fine  its my last atropine  last us about three minutes  lets get her gown up    her heart rate falls below 35 were getting her to the icu  im not gonna let her die in this elevator    where are they  get maintenance up here right away  ear canals clean  left foots clean  if its not here weve only got    heart rates 46  its here  looks like a mole or a freckle something we missed  check the armpits    dr foremans an excellent doctor hell be able to handle it  yeah you know that from experience  you lose a lot of patients on elevators  the maintenance guy said it didnt just stop on its own that they hit the emergency stop button  well im sure he must be mistaken   perineum  we checked it   if we get her upstairs  maxilla  checked  down to 38 we dont have a lot of time  eyebrows eardrums pubic hair  checked checked checked we checked everywhere  its not    we havent found the tick yet  we already kidnapped her you want to add murder  weve looked over every inch of skin on her body house  its over  hey is that the first time you had sex  with all the other stuff going on down there she might not have realized  oh    you sick miserable   what are you doing  oh my god  whoa whoa whoa  see told you itd be even more dramatic  push norepinephrine get her heart back to normal shell be completely cured by tomorrow  foreman lets get her into the icu  inamrinone was a stupid idea  unless you wanted me to get that girl on the elevator  oh i wouldnt do that  wouldnt respect you if you did  wow looks like somebody filed halfway through your cane while you were sleeping  reflexes back to normal hearts looking good too  ill send in the nurse well get you transferred out of icu youll be discharged in the morning  thank god i just want to get home  and back to school on monday  imim not ready  youre ready  im sick mom  youre not sick  youre gonna go to class  and youre gonna see your friends and your boyfriend   whats this doohickey  barbara bel geddes its a brassiere  bel geddes you know about those things youre a big boy now  james well ive never across one like that  bel geddes its brand new revolutionary uplift ive
