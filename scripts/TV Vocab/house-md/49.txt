                youre not going to make this easy are you  unfortunately as much as i admire your spirit  speaking french  subject anesthetized with5 ccs of sodium pentobarbital  transfected with human hepatic cancer cells  underwent six rounds of intraabdominal treatment with es22  vertical incision through the rectus sheath opens the abdominal cavity  incision extended into  the thorax  coughs  liver appears normal in color no apparent scarring or  damn it  cancerous tumors still present on the right lobe  no reduction  gasping  breathing heavily  cancer research specialist  minor tremors a localized melanoma removed two years ago cataracts  and he cant breathe  also disregard the facial lacerations theyre creepy but unfortunately irrelevant  dont you wanna know why  you have your cane  no why the lacerations are creepy  he was about to dissect one of his lab rats when he collapsed  the little vermin seized the day so to speak and went medieval on his ass  what my fly open  so the pains returned  there was no pain he was unconscious  im guessing because he wasnt able to breathe  were talking about you  obviously im obviously not  what is it with you people  i dont use the cane youre shocked i use the cane  were just concerned  about the wrong person i can breathe  ezra powell on the other hand is gonna die  the ezra powell the researcher  the guy who wrote that textbook  that textbook the textbook  wait theres actually another doctor you admire  i admire lots of doctors  of course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than ezra powell  but seeing as they can all breathe  chase oxygenation is through the floor and lungs are full of fluid  gotta be his heart  could be amyloidosis  or his lungs probably from years of inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab  chase its not the lungs the chest xrays clean  foreman sos his ekg its not his heart  were being too nice  outside the hospital he cant breathe  inside the hospital he can because we help  at least enough to screw with our test results  the source of the problems either in his heart or his lungs  so all we gotta do is stop helping  put a little pressure on him and see which gives out first  at 71 we get his heart or lungs to give out we might not get them to give in again  thats why were gonna do it in a hospital  put him on an inclined treadmill and do a stress ekg  so much for the admiration  lets get you started ill turn your oxygen up  i  i worked with williams on the first protocol for this machine  everyone still uses it  except for williams he died four years ago  im sorry  he was 84 he died parasailing  he was always an idiot  you okay  hang in there you know the protocols only a few minutes  foreman his heart rates flat  if we dont get it past 130 were not going to see anything  and if he falls and breaks a hip were not going to see anything either  except an increase in our malpractice insurance  i figured house might go back to the pills  but if hes using his cane hes right back to where he was before  maybe even worse  luckily hell handle it in a stoic grownup fashion  hed never take it out on us  i cant  ive got to stop  just a little longer  his heart rates only 90 im going to increase the incline  ive got to stop ive got to get off  youre doing great just a little faster okay  i dont need a cheerleader i need oxygen  stop this isnt working  his heart rate barely got above 90  he cant breathe theres too much fluid in his lungs  really hes got fluid in his lungs  whatever are we gonna do oh yeah now i remember  put him on a treadmill and run him like one of his rats on a wheel  he cant run he can hardly walk  thats cause hes not trying hard enough  if he was his heart rate would go up  exercising with a lung full of your own bodily fluids tends to hurt  they dont call it a stress test for nothing do it again  hes drowning  then pull him out of the pool and do it again  im assuming this isnt your idea of a longterm solution  we need to get rid of the fluid in your lungs  so youll be able to do the test  to see if its my heart or my lungs  exactly  my moneys on both  ive been in and out of the hospital for the past year  im old im sick and im getting older and sicker  not a very interesting differential but  im in  you dont need a 400 handbag  its kinda hard to check your throat when youre flapping your gums around  sorry  but its for the fall formal  he doesnt care if its for the presidential inauguration  but im using marissaa old dress its free  you know what else is free  the roof over your head the food you eat your phone your computer  how long have you been congested  all week ever since we got back from fresno  fresno thats in france right see the parthenon  california  ive got no appetite im aching all over im weak  does that hurt oh yeah  does his voice always have that unattractive nasal tone  totally  im gonna take that giggle as a no  fever aches weakness loss of appetite  you been having an anal sex with iv drug users lately  of course not im married  you think she might have been having  no  probably a rhinovirus  whats that  a cold  take this four times a day and stay off airplanes  theyre flying cesspools  oops  you dropped something  if theres anything else you can think of please call  yes  hes too old and weak  yeah this is way better thisll work  just try  there are 20 words to describe chest pain  burning squeezing stabbing tearing  each one diagnostically useful  for that you have to thank dr powells textbook  but there are no words to describe degrees of what hes feeling right now  shortness of breath  if he had worked on those issues there would be  he never would have given up until he had an answer  this isnt working  dr house  please dont get up  im sure youre very busy  im just gonna try and speed things up a little  is that epi thats not the protocol  no the protocol is what you tried to do and failed each time  over 100 now were getting somewhere  how does it look foreman  no ekg changes  then we push harder  house youre gonna kill him  no hes right let him do it  see thats why he doesnt have to wear knee socks  he cant breathe   nothing here foreman  still no sign of blockage  which means its not the heart it must be the lungs  see that wasnt so hard was it  no just give me the rest of the epinephrine  the test is over its okay were going to stabilize you  no  no just let me die  youre not gonna die  yes i am  well find a treatment  i dont want to live like this  please im begging you  kill me  he says no more tests  he wants to die and he wants us to help him do it  and i wanna play a little game i like to call block my spike with misty may  hes thought this through its not an impulsive decision  neither is mine hes depressed  hell feel much better after we cure him  hes seen all the tests weve seen  even if we figure out whats causing the lung damage its too late to reverse it  you cant know that without knowing whats wrong  its his call  so what do we do  do we just put a plastic bag over his head and get it over with  no we give him a syringe full of morphine  every doctor ive ever practiced with has done it  they dont want to they dont like to  but thats the way it is i havent i wont  i couldnt do it either  you just said we should respect his decision  respect it doesnt necessarily mean we honor it  right it just means we talk about it  at some point do no harm has to mean allowing nature to take its course  not stubbornly standing in the way of it  sticking a metal syringe into a plastic iv line and pumping in  a lethal dose of morphine is not letting nature take its course  not according to the state of new jersey  so its better we allow him to slowly suffocate in his own plasma  whose side are you on senator  first respect his wishes then invade iraq then get the troops home  make up your mind wow  theres certainly a lot of interesting things to consider  the stress ekg rules out the heart  which means somethings gotta be attacking his lungs  could be mycoplasma or strep pneumo which probably means  its too late to do anything about it  we could try levofloxacin  coming up with a new treatment isnt gonna do us any good  unless we convince him its worth trying  come on hes old and sick and tiny  and we can do whatever we want to him  pagers beeping  what happened  i dont know  he must have fallen out of bed  and got the nasal canula wrapped around his neck somehow  ezra what are you doing  i dont want to live hooked to machines too weak to wipe my own ass  why would you want to wipe your own ass  when you could have someone do it for you  youre wasting your time  there must be other patients you could actually help  all services rendered on a first come first served basis  i wont consent to any more tests  and if anyone tries to so much as touch me  ill press charges for assault  you heard the man  he wants everyone to leave him alone why dont you go first  get out  you came to me i didnt come to you  i figured youd have the guts to do what had to be done if it came to that  were nowhere near that its time to test your lungs  breathe  youre gonna have to exhale sometime  stop  house youre hurting him  youre hurting me  coughing  fine if you dont help us we dont help you  your lungs slowly fill with fluid  you gasp to catch every breath but never can  every breath is petrifying  itll be slow painful torturous  we dont choose our birth and we dont choose our death  what if you could how about we make a deal  give me one more day  if i dont find out exactly whats wrong with you by then  ill help you die house  twentyfour hours  come on its not gonna kill you  old guy lungs fluid go  you cannot help him kill himself  of course i can  chase says we do it all the time  cuddy is not gonna let you  enough  you dont want me to kill him fine  heres a big shock i dont want to kill him either  how do i not kill him by you guys doing your job  we have 24 hours to figure out whats wrong with him  ticktock ticktock  ill draw cultures pneumonia should be bacteria in his blood  thats gonna take longer than 24 hours  not if i spin down the sample  separate off the buffy coat then gram stain for bacteria  great do an amylase ddimer creactive peptide get a urine  and do a bronchial sputum while youre at it  and you check his home and lab for radiation and toxins  and do a bone marrow biopsy  all of that in 24 hours nah  whatever you dont get done you can finish at the autopsy  wow you guys look like crap  what have you got  purple dye on my fingers  what did the bone marrow biopsy show  i dont have the results  what what have you been doing all night  jello shots and wild sex what else  foreman theres no bacteria in the blood cultures  we still have some cooking but so far nothing  nothing in the urine  lab was clean enough to do surgery in because well they do  and there was no sign of viruses  cell phone ringing or fleas on any of the rats  yeah  who  tell her to call the clinic  then tell her to leave a message and ill get back to her  then tell her to leave a personal message  whos that  thats your protg  what are these  dictation tapes he records everything why  because hes a diligent researcher  or hes losing his memory  a lot of people dictate their notes  yes we could assume that and wed have nothing  or we could assume its a symptom  in which case whatevers in his lungs is also in his brain  unless youve got something more promising  ill go get an mri of his head  keep testing till you find something  im going to my office to rest for a while  its been a long time since i took an anatomy class  but im pretty sure youre moving farther and farther away from my lungs  running out of places to look arent you  it doesnt mean were gonna stop looking  oh no not for six more hours  do you want us to fail no  but you will  no abnormal nuclei means no leukemia he a drinker  not according to the history  which means yes he drinks  which gives us a nice mundane explanation for the acellularity  or hes telling the truth which means fungus is still on the table  but your entire view of human nature gets destroyed  six of one half a dozen of the other  bad news fast good news you can take your time  heads clean you were wrong his faculties are intact  too bad if his brain was addled  we wouldnt have to listen to anything he says  hand me the 10 percent koh  its 400 we have nothing to tell him  then we have no reason to talk to him we still havent ruled out fungus  yeah we have no bugs no hyphae  okay next procedure  we sneak in turn back the clock  whole team must be bad news  nope  your bone marrow biopsy revealed multiple myeloma  its not good news but there are some treatments  i need to draw some blood  what about my breathing  associated hyperviscosity syndrome gummed up the blood vessels in your lungs  dr chase said my calcium is normal  we call him dr idiot  theres no m protein in my urine  odd presentation  its so odd that dr cameron doesnt believe it either  just give me 12 more hours  we had a deal no more tests  fair enough give me six more hours  listen there is no evidence that you are terminal  you a man of your word or not  no as a matter of fact im not  fine then discharge me  my lungs will slowly fill with fluid  ill gasp to catch every breath but never can  every breath will be petrifying itll be slow painful torturous  you really gonna let me die like that  where are you going nowhere  everybody who can walk should get out of here  you cant do that  i cant do what  administer a prescription pain killer to a patient whos in pain  go  make sure somebody sees you downstairs in the cafeteria  i cant let you do this  either i die in pain or i just die  that thats what the argument is here no  its about whether you die or we murder you  whats gonna happen here is that someones getting a buttload of morphine  im not sure exactly who at this point  i cant be a part of this  thank you  i always wondered exactly what was on the other side  nothing  machine beeping  what are you doing  getting a laryngoscope  dont just stand there help  but you told him that  a little something i like to call a lie  its bad i know but its way further down the list than murder  hes unconscious no more whining  we can keep testing him  go get a ventilator im not gonna do this all night  house we can legally assume that hed consent  to whatever a reasonable person would consent to  and a reasonable person would obviously consent to being put  in a coma against their will just to satisfy your curiosity  i try to kill him youre mad i dont kill him youre mad  all he wanted was some dignity  were you in that room with him  was he wearing a tux while he choking on his own plasma  keep doing the tests take your time do it right go get to work  wait  cameron why did you do these cuts so far down on this mri of his head  i wanted get his brain stem and his cspine  to make sure his diaphragm wasnt paralyzed  you also caught the top of his lungs theres scarring  you do know that you cant really pierce me with your stares  lung scarring along with the bad bone marrow points to an autoimmune disease  could be pulmonary fibrosis or lupus  he can kill himself after we get him better  start him on an ivig for the lupus and get a colonoscopy  the lupus could be hiding there  i cant do this  drama queen  descending colons clean  moving into the sigmoid  we sure could use a little more help around here  shes doing what she believes in  yeah if she was acting on principle shed be in here trying to stop us  all shes doing is running away from the principle  so she wont have to feel uncomfortable facing it  and if you were acting on principle  you would have called the cops when you thought house was killing the guy  we better hurry up why  cause i dont think shes gonna have a problem deciding what to tell cuddy  monitor beeping  foreman 02 sats  i thought you were only supposed to put on  a pound a week during your last trimester  im not pregnant  i heard about your little stunt with dr powell  not really a stunt more of a trick a ruse a hoodwink  a lie okay  lying is sometimes good right  like when youre trying to teach someone a lesson about humility or something  all im trying to do is save his life hes not gonna learn anything  i just thought the same principle might apply  it does  i could have just let him die  were not gonna get sued for keeping him alive  we could i completely disregarded his wishes  do you want me to disagree with you you want me to yell at you  it is comforting  were doctors we treat patients we dont kill them  how right you are dr cuddy  we also dont pad our bills swipe samples from the pharmacy  or fantasize about the teenage daughters of our patients either  true it better be true and youre a pig  im sorry about your leg  yeah we really should spend some time talking about that  the ivig made him worse   so we know its not lupus  what else could it be  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  were gonna need an open lung biopsy to confirm  so now were gonna operate on the guy  well unless youve invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy  when you searched dr powells office  did you find a copy of the january 1967 massachusetts medical journal  why  i just figured if youre not doing any work  you might like something to pass the time  the centerfolds a killer  hows your leg  it hurts and its gonna keep on hurting  you gonna keep on asking  hows ezra powell  resting comfortably  thats not what cameron says  i hate practicing medicine in high school  hes not asking you to help him kill himself hes just asking for help  the disease will kill him  i know what he was asking for i just said no  youve done it before plenty of times  to patients that i knew were terminal  oh give me a break  this has nothing to do with saving a life  you just cant bear the thought of a patient dying  before youve been able to figure out why  if were gonna keep refusing to cure patients just to rein in my ego  then we might start having a little problem in patient recruitment  worried about meeting your onepatientaweek quota  im a cripple remember accommodations must be made  wedge of left lobe isolated and removed  clamp  whyd you have me look up that article  did you find it interesting  he injected newborn babies with radioactive agents  just to see if they had urethral reflux  he was curious  he didnt even tell their parents he was doing an experiment  he wasnt doing anything his peers werent doing  his peers at tuskegee and willowbrook  he ignored the rights of a few to save many  so youre okay with what he did  it doesnt matter what i think  its what you think thats relevant  because if i think less of him ill help you more  youre wrong  the fact that a patient did bad things doesnt change anything  he still deserves to have some control over his own body  if he had any control over his own body hed be dead  some control we can withhold treatment without killing him  no you cant  you either help him live or you help him die you cant have it both ways  well i guess its not ipf  machine beeping  maybe hell die right now make everything easy for all of us  heart rates fast bps low  no breath sounds on the right side hes dropped his right lung  airs building up in his chest compressing his heart  heart rates decreasing  bps stabilizing  what are you doing  he withdraws from pain stimuli on the left side but not the right  those are just reflex arcs  hes under anesthesia  or hes lost sensation in some places  or the hypoxia from the arrest stunned his cns  only one way to tell do somatosensory evoked potentials  we cant do that while hes in a coma  only two ways to tell get a hammer and check his deep tendon reflexes  it wont work he needs muscle relaxants to be on the ventilator  only one more way to tell pupillary reflexes  all that tests is the brain stem see i was right  only one way to tell do somatosensory evoked potentials  i just said we cant do that while hes in a coma  so wake him up  dont go towards the light  youll fall and break your hip  coughing  whats happening i  you took a little nap  i thought i told you i didnt want  sorry a little deaf in one ear  your bone marrow is hypocellular  weve ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis  but it looks like it could be attacking your nerves  so this is all a waste a huge failure  lmpossible youre gregory house  we need to attach some sensors to your skin  no  look we cant do what you want  weve assigned a nurse to watch you so you cant do it either  so you might as well just let us do the test  no i want to be discharged  you cant be discharged youve got two chest tubes in  then take them out  oh get over yourself  the ventilator puffed up your lungs youll be fine for a few hours  just let us run the tests  okay  but first lets clean you up a little  what does that feel nice  what are you trying to prove just cleaning him up  what does it look like  pay no attention to the man behind the curtain  get out  okay im going already cant you see im a cripple  okay so youve got me curious  i was right  whatever is attacking his lungs is attacking his nerves  and you got that by splashing ice water on him  no sensation in the left leg abdomen right arm  technologys overrated  that means the clean mri of his brain means  its just affecting the peripheral nerves  and bone marrow  kawasakis would explain the kidney failure  so would lymphoma so would sarcoidosis  all potentially treatable the question is which  we need to catch the little bastards in the act  whats the largest organ  skin we need to get a piece  sure well just wait until he leaves his room without his skin  sneak in and take a piece  i want you to get a skin sample for a biopsy  and i want to get a foot massage from johnny damon  kawasakis disease lymphoma and sarcoidosis are all treatable  and it could be a hundred other things that arent treatable you have no idea  but you do  you know everything i didnt say that i  exactly  you cant decide if were helping or hurting him  if its good or bad or if you want paper plastic or a burlap sack  do your damn job  im not gonna lie to him  fine tell the truth just get me a pound of flesh  what do you want  house wants to biopsy your skin he sent me to get it  and you agreed  i had nothing to do with putting you in a coma or any of the subsequent tests  which brings us to now  i read some of your articles  there were a lot of them  1967 massachusetts medical journal  you radiated babies just like that no forms no questions nothing  who knows how many cancers you caused  i dont know  but what i do know is we discovered techniques that  prevent fatal kidney failures in hundreds of thousands of other kids  youre not sorry  i dont regret what i did  informed consent patient rights holds back research  groans  what the hell are you doing  informed consent is holding back our diagnosis  good for you  finally standing up for something acting on what you believe  dr house hi how are you  not as good as you think i am  dont worry im not stalking you my dad just lost his medicine  i needed to come back for another prescription  yeah right  hes moving it on the street isnt he  yeah my dad the meth kingpin  why havent you returned any of my calls  i plan to in a couple of years  i was just calling to say thank you and to tell you how impressed i was  you diagnosed my dad by just looking at him  i felt his glands too  well theres my dad ive got to go  yeah me too  and you really dont have to wait a couple of years to return my calls  just six months till i turn 18  its not kawasakis either what next  congo red  amyloidosis  what the hell else would i mean by congo red  its not on the list  theres no reason for it to be on the list  an abnormal protein is building up inside the cells of his body  shutting down his organs one by one it explains everything  the infiltrates on the xray the bone marrow kidney failure  we rejected amyloidosis because it didnt fit the first symptom we found  it would affect his heart it did  it wasnt on the stress test  we didnt push him hard enough  add the stain and lets find out  congo red added  change the polarization of the light already  that means it should be treatable  how the hell did you pull that out of  not out of mine i had a muse  oh god protein type aa  dr house  you have amyloidosis  its in your lungs kidneys bone marrow and brain  why should i believe you now  if i was lying i wouldnt tell you the subtype is aa  its terminal  congratulations  you got your answer  into dust playing  ezra powell passed away last night  im sure you already knew about that  no i just got in  the nurse charted at 200 am he was stable breathing labored but regular  then at 230 he suddenly stopped you know anything about that  if i did would you really want to know  im proud of you
