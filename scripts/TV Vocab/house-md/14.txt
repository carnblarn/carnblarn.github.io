 getting to yes fifty ways to win an argument hitchhikers guide to being a pal  in five seconds you just manipulated these two into agreeing with your point of view  fellas this is known as soft positional bargaining  its not gonna work  dr house are you saying that she doesnt have a clot  or are you saying that if she does have a clot  she doesnt need blood thinners and an angiogram  chase put her on blood thinners do an angiogram  when that comes back negative mri the spine  if thats clean cut her open and biopsy the leg  excellent suggestion read less more tv   its rare for an individual to make a donation  significant enough to impact an organization as large and unwieldy as a hospital  this donation does come with one string  that he be made chairman of the board  i think thats a reasonable request i think he should have the right to know  what it is we do with his  100 million  please welcome our new chairman of the board edward vogler     thank you  thank you   when i was 18  my dad loaned me 20000 for a college tuition  which he would have known was a mistake had he known i wasnt actually in college   i took his money and invested in a friend who had a little business  and when my dad found out what i had done with his money  he and i didnt talk much after that  but my friends business took off  and i used the profits from that to buy another company and another  and i must have been pretty good at it had a good eye  because before i knew it people were making offers for my company  and about a year ago i went public  and overnight i was worth a billion dollars  so i went to see my dad  ill admit i wanted a little payback you know kind of shove the win in his face  so i drove upstate and sat in the kitchen i grew up in  and uh he had no reaction  it wasnt his fault he didnt even know who i was  because his alzheimers had taken a turn for the worse  despite the best drugs and care out there  and that is why im here  what if my contribution to this hospital is the difference between  no cure and a cure for cancer  the difference between a man not recognizing his wife of 35 years  and being able to look at her and say good morning honey i love you  if theres a disease out there killing people  i am writing you a blank check to fight back  so things are going to change a lot    were gonna have to ask you for the cell phone  do what you need to do im okay  im pretty sure my xray machine can take your phone in a fight  itll fry it  fine   how old is she  thirtytwo  wow and shes already the ceo of a public company  shes a workaholic okay carly hold still  the xray machine is gonna pass over your leg   okay whatd you do with your time off  snowboarding in gstaad  switzerland  do you ski or board you can come with if you like  maybe we should start with a drink before we go around the world  oh you wanna have a drink with me  oh very aggressive i like that  i wanna run this place like a business  what you want to put more vending machines in the hallway  maybe a roulette wheel nice one but im serious  the product that youre selling is good health it shouldnt be a tough sell  if you dont wanna sell it means you dont care if people get your product  you care if people are healthy or are you too proud for that  whos that  oh thats just one of our doctors  arent uh doctors supposed to wear lab coats   hes different  everyones buddy   no not exactly  then why does he get away with it  its just a coat hes very good  hmm   say ah  ah  now really belt it out like youre gonna throw up ahh   perfect  okay thats it  we should know in a couple of days whats growing in your sons throat  hello   he cant talk  excuse me   he had knee surgery  right  about a year ago and then he couldnt talk  right yeah well that happens  you know its very dangerous operating so close to the vocal cords  okay well well send your kids culture to the lab and somebody will call you   boo    just wanted to see if your dad you know bizarre  i need you to wear your lab coat  i need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you like half your age  wear the coat  man oh man someone got spanked real good this morning  a guy gives 100 million to cure cancer  a pretty small concession to wear a lab coat  cure cancer  is the hospital getting out of the dull business of treating patients  you know thats not what hes doing i know exactly what hes doing  hes using us to run clinical trials  oh shame on him saving lives like that  its unethical  oh are you coming in too i thought i had you convinced  clinical trials save thousands of lives  hes using patients as guinea pigs  pharmaceutical companies do that every day  are we a pharmaceutical company were gonna wind up pressuring desperate patients  into choices that are bad for them good for us  were gonna compromise patient care who the hell am i talking to  suddenly ethical lapses are a major concern for you  whats interesting is it suddenly doesnt bother you  so if you ignore ethics to save one person its admirable  but if you do it to save a thousand youre a bastard  all hes done is taken your game and gone pro  hes not gonna kill a few patients hes gonna kill this hospital  it took him three seconds to size you up  and surprise he doesnt like you  wear the damn coat  hello im uh dr foreman i work with dr house  our initial tests say youre fine  we think you had a clot but it resolved on its own  so were gonna keep you overnight to be safe and you can go back home tomorrow  or back to work  hey are you okay     get in here i need a line in her iv morphine stat    you get any read on the new chairman of the board   yeah he took your parking space  its not necessarily bad news  do you ever watch gilligans island reruns  and really really think theyre gonna get off the island this time  we should introduce ourselves it couldnt hurt  make him a bundt cake a patient hit a 10 on the pain scale what would explain that  there was no clot in her leg the angio was totally clean  what about the muscle biopsy  no neurogenic or myopathic abnormalities  she was also negative for trichinosis no toxoplasmosis or polyarteritis nodosa  robert what was her sedimentation rate  normal allison  therefore no inflammation no immunologic response  do you mind sharing that number with me  fifteen allison   are you mocking me  duh allison  im just suggesting we look outside the box what ifher sed rate is elevated  well lets go further outside the box lets say the angio revealed a clot  and then lets say we treated that clot  and now shes all better and personally thanked me by performing  my aunt elyssa lives in philadelphia  oh its story time let me get my baba  her normal temperature is 962 not 986 like you and me  if her temperature were 986 shed have a fever  im just wondering if you think we could apply the same logic to carlys sed rate  its absurd  i love it   if 15 is high for carly then she has inflammation  which could in turn mean cancer ill talk to wilson  next time skip aunt elyssa  youre probably talking about a primary bone cancer  it could be tricky to detect well need a bone scan  thats why im talking to an oncologist  sure ive nothing better to do besides departmental meetings and budget reports  new chairman of the board you know oh i hadnt heard  right clinical trials completely unethical  and a very bad omen for you theres not much money in curing african sleeping sickness  no i have seen every scary movie ever made  sixyearold twins in front of an elevator of blood  boys choirs those are bad omens  this is much more mundane a billionaire wants to get laid  billionaires buy movie studios to get laid  they buy hospitals to get respect  and the reason you want respect to get laid  okay then just gotta think like a billionaire  lets see therell be big scary changes and then  oh dr cameron we should have dinner to discuss your future on my g5 private jet  come on you know how good you have it here  yes im the big poobah the big cheese the goto guy  you do the cases you wanna do when you wanna do them  youre not gonna have that anywhere else relax  ive been through three regime changes in this hospital every time same story  just keep your head down thats all im saying  and put on your coat it itches   so you gonna do this bone scan for me or what  yes  dr simpson did you hear new management  im thinking of switching to orthopedics  how much do you guys get for a massage now without the happy ending  dr house what do you want do you remember a guy named van der meer  not a big talker you fixed his acl  no not according to my medical malpractice premiums  didnt get hypotensive during surgery  no strokes maybe some connectivity loss  what youre gonna get involved now im not involved  a guy brought his son into the clinic i didnt touch the son  im not taking any responsibility there the sons fine cant shut him up  dad show any symptoms of cortical disease wernickes  no nothing  thats why we settled because we couldnt find anything  the guy got over a million dollars dont tell me hes complaining  hes not saying boo  your father wants to know when youll be back from your trip  email back its taking longer than i thought  he doesnt need to see me like this what about your brother   no  hello im dr wilson i was   um robin im gonna need a minute  oh  thank you   there are two dr wilsons in this hospital  one in ophthalmology and one in cancer  my eyes are fine so im guessing youre here to tell me that i have cancer  there is no cancer in your bone  youre not smiling  theres something called referred pain you could have cancer in one part of your body  that presents in another  given your age and your family history im thinking your colon   great  i was at columbia when my mom died now theres a blast  cleaning up her vomit and then running to my econ final  look   if im a shorttimer give me drugs ill go back to work ill die there  whoa theres a very quick test to see if you even have it a colonoscopy   i know how you do that test  if you have colon cancer we can treat it its early  thats what they told my mom she was dead six months later  youre a smart person about to make a very bad decision  you know cancer treatments come a long way in 12 years but if you dont do this now  i dont wanna be looked at  there is another way  we could do a virtual colonoscopy  basically we do a c t scan of your colon its noninvasive  but its very expensive im assuming thats not a problem  say yes   dr becker  mr van der meer   what  relax rickys gonna be just finkf strep throat  heres a prescription for an antibiotic he should be all better in a few days  although this might sting a little  i wanna see you again real soon   virtual colonoscopy was clean  no colon cancer  what happened to our regular oldfashioned colonoscopy  she was uncomfortable doing any more tests i had to convince her to do that one  do you get that often women would rather die than get naked with you  shes scared  but not of tests just embarrassing ones  yeah  its not an inflammatory process its not a clot because chases angio says so  and its not cancer because her tush is perfect  anybody else got an aunt elyssa with weird stuff  maybe its worth looking into  i thought you said carlys angio was clean  it was clean  you guys see the problem here  theres no indication of any abnormalities  no lesions no spurs no mastis  her toes are screwed up theyre backwards  you guys know how much surgery its gonna take to swap em back  what are you talking about  well either she literally has two left feet or you angioed the wrong leg  thats impossible it cant be or maybe it was jenny  how come some resident signed this radiology report were you even in the room   ill redo her angio  youll do nothing  foreman you do the angiogram  i cant believe i did that  why do we have to redo the angiogram  there was a shadow on the first test result shadow  a shadow means there could be a blood clot right  i read conns current therapy  a real pageturner no it wasnt that kind of shadow  my chest hurts its from the tracer i injected  you might also get a little nauseous or have a metallic taste all normal  im a runner i shouldnt feel like this  carly im looking at your vitals right now and  i cant breathe carly  my chest  my chest  respiratory arrest call code   what do you got  shes drowning   foreman did a thoracentesis to drain the fluid from her lungs  shes stable they sent the fluid to the lab itll be back in a few hours  youll be happy to know chases mistake didnt cost her angio revealed no clot  im thrilled    okay see now yourejust being stubborn  its cold its a perfectly good excuse to wear your lab coat  carly needs a heart transplant  thoracentesis revealed a transudate  i havent gotten it back yet  her muga scan what was the ejection fraction  maybe you could treat it surgically i havent done the muga  how do you know she needs a heart transplant  i got my aura read today  it said someone close to me had a broken heart  since when do i need the secret pass code to talk to you  i cant tell you anything professional responsibility  like that matters to you  not my professional responsibility yours  new regime you gotta keep your head down too  now thats good thinking because i was gonna go right to cuddy  and rat you out as soon as you were done talking  im not saying you want to im saying youd be obligated to  because of my position on the board  because of my position on the transplant committee  hey you brought this up for a reason you need to talk to me  i cant  you sure youre doing the right thing  ive come up with a few really great rationalizations  sorry to interrupt we have a problem   thoracentesis revealed a transudate  we did an echo shes in severe congestive heart failure  she needs a heart transplant   well get her on the list immediately  shes already on the list     come in  thanks  what is a department of diagnostic medicine  thats dr houses department  they deal with cases that other doctors cant figure out  its a financial black hole  the department costs us three million a year  to treat one patient a week  he saves one patient per week what about everyone else  his departments not going to find the cure for breast cancer   uh maybe not but  are you sleeping with house  what no but you did right  a long time ago  thats an incredibly inappropriate question  if your judgment is compromised by a prior or current relationship that is my business  i respect him that is all you need to know  hes still not wearing the coat  well i told him im sure you did  and yet hes not wearing it im just wondering if thats a reflection on him  or on you    youre dr house  i found a picture online of you at a conference you need a heart transplant   i run i work out  you cut yourself  probably highly ritualized  you play the same sarah mclachlan song over and over while you do it  probably works better than antidepressants   i dont understand how that  youre a highpowered bulimic you make yourself throw up  you had to find the most efficient way to vomit without revealing the telltale signs ofbulimia  which is all ooh very unseemly for a ceo  so you found a common antidote to accidental poisoning to do the job  ipecac  which is great if your kids just swallowed a bottle of aspirin  but really really bad if its a habit  it causes muscle damage  it caused the pain in your leg  and destroyed your heart  how often do you do it  three times a week  in about an hour theres gonna be an emergency meeting of the transplant committee  to discuss where you fall on the list should a new heart become available  problem is i am required to tell the committee about your bulimia  its a major psychiatric condition ranks right up there with suicidal makes you a very bad risk  so youre here to tell me i have just a few hours to live  unless i lie to the committee  but if they find out i lose my medical license  this would be a very good time to offer me a bribe  you know how much is your life worth how much is my job worth  why are you here doing this to me what do you want  i wanna know whats right  am i worth it  you think im pathetic  has a goodjob everything in the world  but she just doesnt like the way that she looks  oh stop hiding  im asking you if you wanna live or die you cant even say that  what do you want me to do cry yes  i want you to tell me that your life is important to you because i dont know    because thats whats on the table right now your life  i dont wanna die  i dont  this 32yearold female was admitted by my staff  because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh  the patient rapidly deteriorated and now has severe congestive heart failure  pressors and vasodilators have not improved her condition whatsoever  pulmonary function tests show an fec of over three liters  with fe v 1 of at least 90 of predicted  and preserved fed fec ratio and preserved dlco as well  her muga had an ejection fraction of 19 with no focal wall motion abnormalities  heart catheterization revealed clean left right and circumflex arteries  and a subsequent biopsy revealed irreversible cardiomyopathy  which is why were here  uh dr house im confused by your time and date stamps  it appears that you put carly on the transplant list before you did these tests  i had a hunch  you dont have hunches you know  look if the tests had come back differently obviously i would have taken her off the list  but on the long shot  on the long shot that i was right i didnt want to waste time  is there any exclusion criteria we should know about  cat scan revealed no tumors and dr wilson found no trace of cancer  what about any other criteria   no atherosclerotic vascular disease  are there any  no pneumonia no bacteremia no hep b or c or any other letters  substance abuse any history  no alcohol no drugs  any psychiatric conditions history of depression shes a little blue  but turns out she needs a heart transplant so  dr house if you subvert or mislead this committee  you will be subject to disciplinary action  dr cuddy do you have reason to think that i would lie  i simply want you to answer the question  is there anything on the recipient exclusion criteria  that would disqualify your patient from getting a heart  no    beautiful organ donor weather  you lied didnt you  i never lie big mistake  then you should have voted against putting her on the list   youre my friend  oh geez have some backbone  if you think im wrong do something  wait youre getting mad at me for sticking up for you  you value our friendship more than your ethical responsibilities  our friendship is an ethical responsibility    what is it  my patients getting a heart      hes not gonna fire you  id fire you byebye  i screw up the patient dies ill never get another job  so stick your head between your legs and go lick your wounds in gstaad  well i like it here  you guys dont think its weird house knew the patient needed a heart transplant  before we did any heart tests  thats house he knows things  but usually hes putting it in our face  telling us how cleverly he figured it out  this time nothing just had a hunch  that is weird    cauterize that one bleeder  okay ready for the donor heart    they just stopped carlys heart and your dumb patient  theyre all oh the guy who cant talk mr van der meer  hes scheduled an appointment to see you oh goody  i wanted you to know chase is worried youre going to fire him  its bad enough that screwups cost lives  now weve got vogler screwups cost jobs  i want chase scared  i want him doing everything he can to protect his job  dr house if you were in his position wouldnt you be more likely to perform well if you were reassured  oh will you stop it with the book why are you doing this  im not doing anything youre manipulating everyone  people dismiss me  because im a woman because im pretty  because im not aggressive  my opinions shouldnt be rejected just because people dont like me  they like you  everyone likes you  do you  i have to know  no  okay    five hours 23 minutes thats fast  is that good or bad it depends  either surgery went really well or it ended really abruptly  textbook shell outlive us all  thank you   triage nurse pick up line 2741    so sing for me  oh no no no no come on look  when you had your surgery you were intubated the surgeon stuck a tube down your throat  now it never happens and its never caught but it happened  your vocal cords were paralyzed i treated the spastic dysphonia with botox  ironically a substance that tightens every other corner of your face  it actually loosens the tongue i have healed you you can talk    oh well  boo   okay  you dont have to say anything it can be our little secret  if you can talk blink twice  but youre not going to  because you think you wont be entitled to the money you won in the settlement with simpson  yesterday i would have said you had to give the money back  today hospitals come into a lot of money  mums the word    hey  hey  i know the cardiologist has given you some guidelines  a schedule of medication and a strict diet  just what somebody with an eating disorder needs  so i thought id get you started  fried chicken from the carnegie deli   youre kidding  yeah  actually i got it downstairs    why did you fight for me  you risked so much and you hardly know me  youre my patient  dont screw it up        love this part     okay he ruined it  just wanted to stop by and introduce myself im edward vogler new chairman of the board  in a way i guess that makes me your boss  i am sorry about the lab coat thing my dry cleaners just destroyed it  that was my very first heart transplant committee meeting very exciting  trust me six flags way more exciting  your patients very lucky to have such a passionate doctor stands up for what he believes in  sweet of you to say  yeah afraid youve been duped though  the nurse found this in the patients purse  oh my if only id known  tough being a doctor having all that power  the power to play god  yes i dont envy the transplant committee their responsibility  they basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl  im not sure i could have done that  this is not a game to me dr house  no its actually more like were dancing right now  so lets get to the point you dont like me  im pretty sure im not gonna like you its nothing personal  i dont like anybody  but none of that really matters does it  because youve got money and ive got tenure  you need full board approval to get rid of me ive got cuddy  right and wilson  so as long as were stuck with each other  we might as well ignore each other        that wasnt nearly as dramatic as i was hoping    i looked into that tenure thing and youre right  its actually easier for me to get rid of a board member like cuddy or wilson  than to get rid of a doctor  thats interesting isnt it  thats some bad hat harry
