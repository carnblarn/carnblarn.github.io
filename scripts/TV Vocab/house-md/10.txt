                    hi  sounds like a good party  twenty bucks okay no problem  i uh just i got it in here somewhere  oh you know im  im sorry i guess i must have forgotten to go to the machine  yeah and brush your teeth  lady you dont have two cents  well i can i can get it from from my friend whos inside  he can give it to me and then ill bring it back out to you you dont know anybody here  yes i do james hes blond and hes really friendly and hes a big talker  i need to see him  go on in     james  james  james hi  do you know wherejames is  oh yeah hes hes around here somewhere   lets go find him  james do you know wherejames is   where is james   james james    james james    oh yeah hes hes around here somewhere  where is he  please i really need to find him  what are you doing   bitch        no shes trying to help me   get off her get off me     settle down  move   geez i didnt touch her  great now we gotta go to a hospital  homeless admitted 24 hours ago with a suspected drug overdose  her tox screens clean but shes still delusional  homeless usually means crazy no money  cuddys not gonna be were a teaching hospital  no i d doesnt even seem to know her name  i got called in because of some lesions on her arm  homeless always means no roof leads to too much sun no the lesions were noncancerous  but i noticed a twitch her wrist   you feel that  sure im human  make a fist around my fingers as tight as you can  squeeze i am  all right  raise your arms above your head for me       shes seizing   get me some ativan  she doesnt wanna be discharged shes manipulating you  its real check a finger stick   blood sugars 38  i need d50 iv push stat  fake low blood sugar now thats acting  the blood sugar was real  shes probably diabetic odd on her own insulin  room 2032 do you have her effects out here  look a seizure buys her a place to sleep while the nice doctors run their tests  maybe a few free meals  twenty bucks says theres insulin in there  oh wow put this back please  what about the twitch her arm moved  why fake a twitch in case the seizure was too subtle  the twitch could indicate a tumor which could indicate  a need to see a neurologist which is why you called me  keep an eye on her till 200 pm watch her blood sugar give her a nice hot lunch  then discharge her   hes wrong  foreman is wrong  the neurologist is wrong about a neurological problem  he took one look at her and figured it was a scam  so you figure hes not being objective  house the woman had a twitch she had a seizure  both of which foreman saw he just wanted her out the door  whoa whoa whoa back up there big fella  foremans the guy you wanna take a swing at    i just want her to get some medical attention  thats not even close to being true  its something else something personal  give me the file  looks like thisll be fun  the twitch could be a miniseizure unrelated to the diabetes  brain tumor  glad you could join us eric  whats the differential for a twitch in the wrist  the patients a 30ish jane doe i thought i just discharged her  well shes my patient no harm in a second opinion  a blow to the head a subdural hematoma  read the file no evidence of cranial trauma   a twitch could indicate a brain tumor  or about a dozen other things  come on theres two things homeless people are good at  getting sick and running scams  if youre so worried about it being a brain tumor get her an mri   when shes clear on that then you can bounce her out of here  well youve got her all figured out   ive known a lot more homeless people than you have  yes youve got that going for you  how could i have doubted your medical opinion  the big question youre missing it all of you  oh geez  who is she  okay why are we on this case just because wilson asked   do i need a better reason  well most people wouldnt you do  the only thing we know for sure aboutjane doe is that her name isntjane doe  which means no medical history  allergies medication previous diagnoses treatment  we have no baseline no context for medical treatment  wow looks just like insulin  vomit still moist    what do you think couple of days old  ugh you trying to make me hurl  yeah and heres the big finish   salty  chemical imbalance  low magnesium could cause a twitch or high calcium   or its a coincidence the point is we dont know anything  so do the mri find out  the mri can wait hang a banana bag  give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance well take it from there  great thanks  okay even if shes not faking whats so fascinating about this case  at the moment how much you dont want me to take it  thats pretty fascinating   nice likeness of dr foreman  in fact hes never looked better  he doesnt like me i can tell  its okay he doesnt like me either   whos james    ow pain in your head   get away from me   no no no no  all right lets cool her out one milligram ativan push  no no no no no no no  hold on   aah aah     she bit me     good news is shes negative for hiv and hep c  yeah im getting a tetanus shot shes getting an mri   theres a twoday wait for nonemergency mris  shes getting an mri then shes outta here  but dr terhark specifically said id have the mri at 1000  its almost 1100 and i havent even had the pretest yet   sorry were a little backed up   excuse me youre dr terharks 1000  im angela whitney im meeting my decorator at 1130  shes coming all the way from new york  dr terhark promised id be home in time  of course  she just about prepped for her mri  mrs whitney   you tried to steal someone elses test  dr terhark is a plastic surgeon  the woman was getting a sixmonth checkup on her chin implants   i cant believe you authorized this  really  it sounds exactly like something id do  she cant have an mri  the ct scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm  the mri magnet would have ripped it out ofher body  you like the alien movies  you had no medical history what were you thinking  well surgically remove the pin then do the mri does that sound good  she has an electrolyte imbalance  dr foreman a neurologist believes this woman has a brain tumor   actually l  hey dont ever apologize for a medical opinion  if hes right and we dont do this test the patient dies  i realize that you have a specialty of your own but does yours have anything to do with the brain  his does  fine   but nothing more until you find out who she is  how are we supposed to  hey he knows more homeless people than any of us  go check out the hood dog  i dont know  ive seen a lot of faces around here but i dont think i know her  great  say i uh like that jacket  yeah uh its all comin to me now  i know where she keeps her stuff     just bats  i thought the lining would be thicker  no tumor nothing her brain is clear  which means that girl had surgery just so you wouldnt get reamed out by cuddy  not necessarily there could still be something neurological going on  sure shes not conning us the mri is  not wearing a coat in this weather that is so wrong she drew these  they might give us a clue  she sign them her name would be a start  all the mythology the locations theyd all depend on her life experience  philadelphia  look at that skyline  its very evocative  the chrysler building   thats a cloud  and the chrysler buildings in new york  ehh im getting philly  and that cactus well its a its a smashed car   its a car accident  a cactus in philadelphia  water well waters october right obviously  well the page number 22 so thats october 2 2002  ergo the patient was in a car accident two years ago last october  my goodness was she okay  broke her arm i think  they fixed it with this  surgical pin  better than a wallet serial numbers in case of recall tied to a patients name  thats why you insisted on the mri  so you could remove the surgical pin from her arm   you didnt think i was gonna do it to save your sorry ass did you    you might wanna take a look at that  her name is victoria matsen or at least thats the one she used then  any hospital with a record of treating her should be sending that information  oh crap  her blood work came back an hour ago magnesium was normal  did you change her banana bag stopped the magnesium started iron dextran for severe anemia  shes allergic to iron dextran     grab some epi off the code cart    respiratory arrest call a code   youre having an allergic reaction can you speak    shes not getting any air  got the epi   sats are down in the 80s and dropping  we have about another minute   well we got her sedated and stabilized  and you still think theres nothing wrong with her nothings changed  you almost killed her thats different  and we know who she is  so far weve heard from three hospitals with records on victoria matsen  seven visits going back two years    any home addresses  the pin in her arm went in during an er visit  she wasnt conscious so they didnt get an address   the other visits she gave fake addresses  any treatment for neurological problems  anything that might explain the twitch  last winter jefferson hospital in philly got treated for frostbite  baby its cold outside  and depression they put her on prozac  well id be bummed out too zero degrees living in a box  put her back on it she cheers up she might stop biting people  theres a billing record from hartman hospital last year two appointments ultrasounds  doesnt say what for pregnant  well only if she was expecting an elephant  appointments were ten months apart  kept the first blew off the second  abdominal pain   her chart doesnt say  wait a minute  she goes in the first time  they look they cant find anything ten months later why should she subject herself to that again  why make a second appointment she didnt  the nurse made the appointment  they were looking they were looking for ovarian cancer    you got all of that from one canceled appointment  with jerry lauseng yeah hes an oncologist  hang on her current blood work doesnt show cancer ca 125 is normal  and the cancer wouldnt account for the alleged twitch or any ofher other alleged symptoms  actually it would  neoplastic syndrome associated with the cancer  could cause her to twitch like a bunny on crystal meth  ultrasound her ovaries   did you find a brain tumor on her mri  no foreman was wrong  im starting to wonder about that guys medical chops right   shelley diamond  yeah  dr house is ready to see you now  the little ones are licking each other again and harrys got a seeping wart on his extra toe  what room should we go to        you know what i think i might be coming down with something  hate to give it to you guys sorry  oh yeah just walk out like im not gonna do anything  byebye  working hard  this stuffs pretty good  calendraica works for the council of genius  bad guy is mr fury  fairly generic no special skills but apparently very well organized  you think you work hard try ruling the universe  you trying to teach me something here  we got the flowing dress the ring think the patient was married  maybe it was a bad breakup maybe he dumped her cause she was on drugs  you care about her personal history no  question is why dont you  i hate to cite a cliche but dad on the streets   dads with mom  theyre both living on the streets  no on a pension   so who pissed you off    right now you   your turn you gonna tell me why this case  shes my new girlfriend im having a tattoo designed  i was hoping you could find out her name  so shes just another sick person that kindly dr wilson has made sure doesnt get lost in the big ugly system  yes i forgot i need a reason to give a crap  youre giving two craps the metric system always confuses me  dr house   time for girl scout cookies already  get me some thin mints  since youre too sick to work in the clinic   okay   i thought you    i thought you could do some teaching patient histories  my specialty  when you teach you learn so much dont you think  its all about the giving back  good old cuddy always thinking  she assign you a patient to interview  mmhmm mmhmm  then why are you still here   why are we on this case cause wilson asked house to do him a favor  i think house just wants to prove shes sick so foreman will be wrong   oh you boys  hey im just doing my job  whoa  foremans gonna be so embarrassed when he finds out shes got cancer  ah i thought you were too sick to be down here  i had to get away from those students so i faked a page  foremans parents happily married 40 years  mazel tov kein ayin hara  so why does he hate homeless people  i mean if its an uncle or a grandparent youd think hed use it in his college application essay  family struggles beats a 40 gpa any day   i think he had a 40  maybe hes just a snob  you really dont need to know everything about everybody  i dont need to watch the oc but it makes me happy  yeah delirious whats the other file  wilson james boy wonder oncologist  you know him  you know in some cultures its considered almost rude for one friend to spy on another  of course in swedish the word friend can also be translated as limping twerp    did your pager really just go off or are you ditching the conversation  why cant both be true come on  solid noncystic mass on the left ovary  fivebythree centimeters  central necrosis  the only question is whether she dies in two months or three  god you were right  theres nothing we can do for her here might as well put her back on the street  unless its not cancer   ah youre joking  well hard not to  nothing funnier than cancer  what if its a tuberculoma shes living out on the streets breathing all kinds of crap 247  the odds are shes got tb why cant she have a nice benign growth to go with it  a solid mass on her ovary ovarian cancers way more likely  youre right its not even close  start her on inh rifampin and streptomycin  but thats the treatment for a tuberculoma  and what is the treatment for advanced ovarian cancer  pine box   oncologist to nuclear medicine oncologist to nuclear medicine  what are you giving me a second dose of antibiotics  if youve got a tuberculoma it should help  i dont have a tuberculoma do i   probably not  hey listen im sorry i didnt believe you  im sorry i lied to you  i took too much insulin on purpose  i really wanted a place to sleep  were you ever married victoria  but in the comic it well its a comic comics are just made up  so whos james  is he real or did you make him up  hes real  can i help you find him  oh the the lights bright  its getting brighter oh ow oh  hey take it easy everythings fine  mr fury wants to hurt me please help me  doctor wait wait wait  hold on hold on please turn off the light  please oh god   all right hold on victoria  hold on take it easy everythings fine   its burning  everythings fine victoria  its burning hold on  im burning take a sip take a sip   its poison you gave me poison  hold on   take it easy     hey turn off that damn light  help me please  take it easy take it easy the bad guys cant get you here ive got you covered  but mr furys not the bad guy  im the bad guy its me im the bad guy    its not a tuberculoma  cant be  i didnt know the biopsy was back her temperatures 105  the treatments not working its cancer  shes dying   good news  its a tuberculoma how do you figure that her temps through the roof  the lab results from the biopsy its definitely a tuberculoma  so were right about the diagnosis  and the treatment for that diagnosis is killing her  perfect   the lab checked the biopsy again twice  well a tuberculoma doesnt give you a temperature of 105  then its a tuberculoma and something else  the something else is gonna melt her brain poach  better metaphor  a fever that high has to be bacterial   maybe the bowel got nicked in the biopsy  i did the biopsy no nick   she could have picked up an infection on the streets  she didnt have a fever when i admitted her  the prozac we gave her could have triggered serotonin syndrome which would explain the fever   no jefferson put her on prozac and it wasnt a problem  she probably never took it  most likely they saw her one time and dumped her out of the er with a scrip   oh just like you were gonna do  okay you two grab some scalpels and settle this like doctors  send blood and urine cultures and get a chest xray  fine take her off the prozac and put her on bromocryptene for the serotonin syndrome  might wanna get her in an ice bath as well assuming we want her to live long enough to see those test results  i said i was sorry  your fevers 105 if we dont bring it down fast  foreman why are you doing this to me  im saving your life   no dont make me go in there please dont make me do it please  i dont wanna go  come on you can do this      please  seventeenyearold female presents with abrasions and apparent trauma injury to her wrist  dr house continue  youre reading a comic book  and youre calling attention to your bosom by wearing a lowcut top  oh im sorry i thought we were having astate the obvious contest  im competitive by nature  i thought you were supposed to be listening to our patient histories  no im supposed to be teaching you if i can do that without listening more power to me  seventeenyearold female  if this guys supposed to have universal power over all gravity how come his hair wont stay down  thats just stupid   she fell offher horse while riding in the county fair  no she didnt  she fell off the steps of her beach house you must have gone to the wrong room  hard to believe that one patient could slip past cuddy and get herself admitted with a sprained wrist  two seems almost impossible what room   room 2106  patients lie but usually only one lie at a time  how much does she weigh   its her wrist not her weight  poundage ladies   and bytheby what colors her nose  shes thin   flesh tone  what does this have to do with her wrist   almost nothing  shes either under ninety pounds or she has a red nose i gotta go   whats wrong with her    that would be telling  oh i am just too nice  it starts with c   urine cultures are negative  so is the chest xray   i assume theres a positive coming  lumbar punctures reveal elevated proteins and white counts  csf cultures still brewing  nothing on gram stain it looks like meningitis   we know its definitely an infection and we know where it is  well meningitis is nice and simple  get her in isolation and start her on ceftriaxone  either she gets better or she dies  let me know which one happens  oh my god she was sedated   it must have worn off  i did it myself a halfhour ago  ill check the nurses station  calendraica  shes gonna die out there  you dont walk out of a room with 10 milligrams of haldol in your system  you dont walk at all it was 10 milligrams i gave it to her  it doesnt matter bacterial meningitis highly contagious  if she is out of the hospital we are so liable  not to worry shell be dead before she can kill anybody  security tape confirms it she stole some clothes and shes gone    wrong coat the capes in the closet i had it cleaned   funny  you gonna save her   in her comics mr fury lives in sloan harbor  the night she came in she was at a rave at 1408 sloan street  youve been reading my how youve changed  you are a doctor do what doctors do  pick up the phone dial 911 and a cop on the other end does what cops do  and finds the missing person  i assume the rest of you have doctor things to do i know you do   cacchiricci disease  do you even know what that is  or are you just guessing everything that starts with c  the kidney problems could result in weight loss cacchi cac  oh geez shes going alphabetically  doctor why are you wearing that bird pin  it sets off my eyes  hi jodi im dr house what brings you to the hospital  my wrist how did that happen  i was riding the ferris wheel and this huge seagull flew right at me  how horrifying  i swung my arm at the bird but i hit the ferris wheel  shes making it all up   no her wrist really does hurt  im not lying  of course you are you have no idea what happened you have no memory  korsakoffs syndrome  her brain is damaged by excessive drinking or insufficient diet pretty obviously the latter  she has no new memories no new ideas  cant even process that idea  so her brain fills the gaps as best it can using visual clues  the horse on your shirt led her to the riding accident  and the surfscene on your clipboard led her to the beach  korsakoff doesnt start with a c  i didnt say c  or did i  lesson to be learned treat everybody as if they have korsakoffs we all lie anyway  give her thiamine right away shell bounce back pretty quickly  and then get her to eat some cake and ice cream  yes  did you need to be so cruel i think shes crying  hi jodi im dr house what happened to your wrist  there was this weird old guy he had a cane  see its like it never happened  perfect forgiveness  pulse is rapid you got a temp  dont know shes warm but might be something to look into she has meningitis  sorry i was more worried about her heart blowing up pulse is 150  rhythm regular yeah  ready one two three   whered you find her  battlefield state park  she narrow complex uhhuh   she wasnt at sloan  she was just passed out on the grass  foreman i need foreman  all right supraventricular tachycardia get me adenosine one milligram iv push  right away thank you  hang in there   her arrhythmias stabilized  doesnt make sense what would push her heart rate over 150 dehydration   fever  unlikely by themselves neither one would do it  we must be wrong about the meningitis maybe its structural heart disease  her heart rate dropped when you administered the adenosine  in two seconds  its still meningitis  if it is with the delay in treatment shesshes got almost no chance  start the treatment  read the report i found her lying on the grass  you should read my reports i make up stuff all the time  what really happened  well since its you  i found her lying on the grass  wow  that is a greatlooking gun  its not a gun its a taser  its so coollooking what does it do  fire about 60000 volts  at least thats what it would take to jack someones heart up to 150  okay okay  lets just say i tell you what happened it stays between you and me right  i found her lying on the grass  fine  dont tell me  tell my friend ben franklin   dr wharton to the research lab dr wharton to the research lab  i watch a lot of cop shows  the good news is the heart rate thing is not connected to her condition  well then shes dying cause the meningitis treatment isnt helping her shes getting worse  well that brings us to the bad news  the cop tasered her   jerk probably couldnt get to his real gun fast enough  first time he hit her in the thigh  and shejust kept going like it was nothing  right about here  she didnt feel the taser  localized numbness yeah in that one spot  the diabetes  i dont think so  well no alcohol not entrapment syndrome  cant be a vitamin deficiency  we cant chase down every sensory neuropathy  is that where she bit you yeah  what the hell  cant get angry if you dont feel anything  first theres localized numbness  then sensitivity to light  disorientation paranoia  ineffectiveness of sedatives and then hydrophobia  fear of water  rabies  there have only been what  yeah thats because nonhomeless people when they get bitten they get shots  there were bats    shes dying  theres no treatment  how much time does she have  a day maybe two  and if you dont get your shot in the next say three hours  im gonna have to make another affirmative action hire  come on   do it    you want me to talk to her  and say what  theres some experimental treatment thats not gonna work no  but dont worry we can make you comfortable   doesnt matter  now shes gonna die in that room  yeah  thats what you say to her  keep that there and rest for a minute   whoa whoa whoa  tell house i need to go out for about an hour  she may not have that long  i dont want her to die alone  youre going to find james  im gonna try  well i must say hes done a lot with the place  hello  hey  this is it  man no ones been in here for a long time  its gotta bejames  maybe theres another address  thats notjames  paul  paul furia  mr fury  her husband  then whos james  her kid   aw i just wanna eat you up youre so delicious    aw look at me  youre just like your papa look at you just like your dad  foreman  foreman    theyre dead  that car crash two years ago  she broke her arm and they were killed  she was driving  james  no  its paul paul  youve come to take me  no  ive come to forgive you    it wasnt your fault    im so sorry  im so sorry im so sorry  i know   its okay victoria  its okay      oh  you

a conversation about friendship yeah  i had some followup questions  ive met your parents and your brother  i have two brothers  why wouldnt you tell me it wasnt relevant  why not because hes not in my life anymore  well thats relevant  this was the last place i saw him  nine years ago  i dont even know if hes alive  thats some bad hat harry
