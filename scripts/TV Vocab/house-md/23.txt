later  stacy its house i know you can handle it  nothing to handle he obviously wants to talk to you alone  cuddy if you have a problem working with stacy  you should have said so  what was i supposed to do ask her to leave thats just rude  death row guy i want the case  how do you even know about him  you dont have access to the hospitals mainframe  no but partypants does  you stole my password  hardly counts as stealing its a pretty obvious choice  well i have already assigned death row guy to dr nolo  nolo well l  i dont wanna say anything bad about another doctor  especially a useless drunk  you are addicted to pain pills  yeah but im not useless tell nolo im taking over  dr nolo is a boardcertified cardiologist  well good im sure hell explore all the usual options  for why a guys heart starts beating so fast it pumps out air instead of blood  wait a second there are no usual options  how badly do you want this  i will give you two more clinic hours this week  dont bend over for the soap  just the heart or the patient have any other complaints  patients not talking to anybody  where are we going  you are going to the clinic for two hours  me why  talk to cuddy  shes got me going to mercer state prison capital sentences unit  arent there better ways to spend our time  good question what makes a person deserving  is a man who cheats on his wife  more deserving than a man who kills his wife  yeah actually he is  what about a child molester  certainly not a good guy but he didnt kill anybody  maybe he can get antibiotics but no mrls  what about you  what medical care should you be denied for being a car thief  tell you what three of you work on a list  of what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed  ill review it when i get back  your patient shanked one inmate his first month here  broke another ones neck nearly decapitated one of my guards  relax i got a great bedside manner  too dangerous to house him in the infirmary  you dont have to worry weve taken every precaution  ive had my men clear from the cell all pens paper clips and staplers  any supplies that might be used as a weapon  open her up  keys rattllng  warden for your visit weve got him cuffed and shackled  and yet youre staying out there  youre gonna have to give me that wouldnt want anybody to get hurt  hi hi  im dr cameron how you feeling  little cough no big deal  okay then what you doing here  i just got a job at the university they need a health clearance  apparently im a little anemic so they made me get some more tests  any family history of anemia  not that i know of my mom died of cancer when i was a kid  my dads heart gave out a couple of years ago  brothers and sisters  im afraid its a short family history thats it  i had a husband once but it didnt stick  my tests should be back probably in that file  probably yeah  is everything okay  wllson did you redo the xray twice  well you dont need a consult  you know the diagnosis  all she has is a cough  bluish tinge to the fingernails lips  hes hypoxic whats that mean  it means hes not getting enough oxygen  you know how people say you cant live without love  well oxygens even more important  gasplng  hes got fluid in his lungs breathing rate of 50  he needs to be intubated put on a respirator  dont have a respirator  better get one in about an hour or youre gonna lose him  ill make out a requisition states already sentenced this man to die  i think the state was a tad more specific about how  this is dr gregory house  i need an ambulance pickup at mercer state prison  wasted call my men will stop them at the gate  no way a death row inmate leaves my prison  at least not through the front doors  you work fast so do you  was that a shot yeah  it was easy once i convinced the clerk to take it to judge markham  shes a sucker for eighth amendment arguments  stop im getting turned on  house  it was just a consult  you expect us to shut down an entire floor for this guy  did you do something to your hair  stacy  you said you cleared it with her  come on youve known me how long  and you still cant tell when im joshing you  take him back to prison now no cant  see ironically im bound by this court order that your ace attorney got  i have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him  is it just me or is that weird  anyway were walking  slghlng  somebody left this on my chair  its clever cause it forces me to either deal with the file or never sit down again  cindy kramer i told her youd see her  well you shouldnt have told her that  shes got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer six months tops  have you even looked at the xray  no just guessing  its a new game if im wrong she wins a stuffed bear  a spot on an xray doesnt necessarily mean that shes terminal  i love children so filled with hope  it could be pneumonia it could be sarcoidosis  could be if she didnt already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung  can we at least brainstorm for other ideas  slghlng thank you  i still think pneumonia and sarcoidosis  but we should check for tuberculosis  and definitely rule out congestive heart failure  five stages of dying  exactly  personally i think its all just new age crap  but from your tearfilled puppy dog eyes  i think ive made my point  now go tell cindy whateverhernameis that shes dying  tachycardia pulmonary edema likely suspects  the death row guy  thats who youre working on instead of cindy  god ive got to learn not to beat around the bush  by dying i meant no matter what we do  very very soon she is going to be dead is that still too subtle  i took an oath to do no harm  yeah but its not like they make you sign it or anything  we cure your patient he goes back to death row  he goes back to death row they kill him  he stays here and we dont treat him he dies  and i still dont treat cindy lou who  can we get on with this  yeah i knew i could count on your help for your homie  exactly im black i sympathize with guys who grew up in the inner city  kept down by the man  makes sense to me foreman its a bunch of crap  you cant blame society for the fact that you chose to become a killer  the guys probably a heroin addict  that explains the tachycardia which caused the pulmonary edema  how does an inmate on death row get his hands on heroin  are you serious house man knows prisons  when we got a yachting question well come to you  okay drugs it is test his hair blood urine works  thanks for getting my back  i thought you seminary boys were against the death penalty  ive left the seminary  over their stance on capital punishment  im against the death penalty in principle  in practice however watching a murderer die causes me  a lot less grief than annoying my boss  we gotta check you out before you go in  cameron department of justice statistics show  that its a racially motivated form of punishment  black defendants are 10 times more likely to get a death sentence than whites  doesnt mean we need to get rid of the death penalty  just means we need to kill more white people  grunts  its okay youre in a hospital were taking care of you  stay calm you hear me push two milligrams ativan  groanlng  water water  whats the differential for being thirsty  he was just a little dehydrated and out of his mind  we upped his saline drip hes fine now  blood and urine tests came back clean no sign of opiates in his system  dont do that  what you have some house theory explaining heroin use  despite a negative test nope  only i get to write on the board  so its not drugs  what else can cause a heart to do wind sprints  you got the blood work back anything out of the ordinary  his bicarb is low  yeah but which column  it could be the result of the tachycardia or it could be the cause  its the cause why because you want it to be  lets see how well that works with your other patient  were just talking semantics here  we should put him on a bicarb drip and send him back  right buff his numbers dont bother trying to figure out the underlying cause  i thought you cared about patients  foreman our job isnt to make sure he can bounce his grandkids on his lap  our job is to get him healthy enough to go back to death row  our job is to diagnose him  what  mommy and daddy are having a little fight doesnt mean weve stopped loving you  now go outside and play  get daddy some smokes and an arterial blood gas test  exclalmlng  that was impressive okay what number am i thinking of  are you trying to get me fired  if you didnt want me working here why didnt you just say so  i just dont want you working right here in my office  but anywhere else in the building is fine oh  its a really big hospital  im a lawyer youre a jerk theres gonna be some overlap  god i hope that was a euphemism  cuddy just reamed me  i hope that one means what i think it means  for trusting you  she figured when she hired me shed at least have someone  you couldnt walk all over  the number was six by the way  i need to know can i trust you  if i hadnt lied to you about cuddys approval my patient would be dead  great  now i know  now we can work together  ill be drawing some blood from your femoral artery  from my what runs through your groin  you think youre gonna stick me in the jewels with that  its really closer to your thigh technically at this point it seems like  your jewels are more for display purposes anyway  hold up hold up gimme some painkillers or something  a tough guy like you dont need them forget that numb me up man  you got some gang ink let me see that  its a native american symbol it means the force of life  thats what you tell all these white dudes so they let you play doctor  yup got them all fooled  for real how a brother like you go from gang banging to wearing that white coat  hows a brother like you go from loving a woman to punching her skull in  bitch stepped out  screams  sorry about that guess i didnt use enough lidocaine  blood gas came back with a ph of 728 and decreased hco3  which means two things  most importantly cameron was wrong about the bicarb  and less significantly we have a new symptom  anion gap acidosis  whos chubby come on pretend he loves puppies  pretend hes a human being what do you got  i think we should reconsider drugs  he already tested negative thats why i said reconsider  back in juvie i cut up oregano and sold it as pot  is that how you put yourself through med school  what if clarence thought he was taking heroin but it was something else  what something else could lead to anion gap acidosis  mudpiles  well you dont have to ask just wash your hands before you come back  methanol uremia diabetes  oh its a mnemonic that makes sense too  paraldehyde lnh lactic acid rewind  inh yahtzee  drugs for tuberculosis  nearly a quarter of the prison population is infected with tb  clever entrepreneur like foreman here chops up his meds passes it off as heroin  inh poisoning would explain all the symptoms  who wants to head over to the prison and find clarences secret stash  fine ill do it great chase it is  i assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable  you got a prettier mouth  better chance the inmates will open up to you  john cllft perhaps ill come out looking just as monstrous  i mean isnt that what i deserve  dr vlvlan john it wasnt your fault  if your father hadnt slipped you those drugs you would have never done  the mans in a coma  he didnt mind i asked  youre getting crumbs all over him  why do you think they put tvs in coma patients rooms anyway  some people think they can still hear  well so leave them a radio  his eyes are closed  who thinks they can see  slurplng  do you know why people are nice to other people  oh i know this one  because people are good decent and caring  either that or people are cowards  if im mean to you youll be mean to me mutuallyassured destruction  exactly are you gonna eat these chips  are you gonna get to your point  you need people to like you  i dont care if people like me  yes but you need people to like you because you need people  unless you think you can get the next court order yourself  if stacy cant trust you you cant use her  and thats not even dealing with the greater agenda of getting her  to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again  dr bruce we were gonna be with each other forever  look i know youre friends with her but there is a code  bros before hoes man  beeplng  crap what is it  death row guy is dying  beeplng  bradycardia his heart rates dropped to 30  its not gonna hold out much longer  you just waiting to call time of death or are you gonna give him atropine  temporary fix right  dont know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin  theyre just gonna have to take more  atropines only gonna buy you a few hours  we dont even know whats wrong with him  just get out of here  cell phone rlnglng  this is chase  did you beat any confessions out of anybody  i havent spoken to any inmates  does anybody do their jobs anymore  i decided clarences life isnt worth risking mine for  appreciate your candor  did you even go to the prison or are you just out playing polo  im searching both of clarences cells  i figured if hes on something its stashed somewhere  unless he finished it  yeah thatd be a shame he could have shoved it anywhere  theres envelopes stacked to the ceiling bottles of copier toner  boxes of rubber bands paper file folders  call it off  come on back  whats going on  youre dying  house a man deserves a last drink  youre okay  thanks that means a lot  all the tests have been inconclusive  diagnostics is more of an art than a science  should i be worried right now  i work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country  were pouring all of our energy into figuring this out  house i thought you convicts knew how to drink  youre at least three shots behind  now youre four shots behind  you better get me the next one or im gonna kill you  chuckles  both laughlng  house  i was just waiting for test results i was  little busy right now getting my drink on  unbelievable  clarence exclalms  thats the finest piece ive seen in 10 years  i couldve hit that  and you didnt  man youre the one that should be locked up  tell me something ive been trying to figure this out  why does a guy whos on death row  suddenly try to off himself  i know you drank that copier fluid  its not as visually dramatic as slitting your wrists with a homemade shiv  but it will do the trick  slghlng  it just hit me all of a sudden  it was like they tell me when to eat when to sleep  when to walk when to talk everything  i had to take control of something right  when to die  i figured that was as good as anything  and that thought just came to you just like that  man i told you for 23 hours  exclalmlng  look heres the good news  the copier fluid you drank  contains about 90 methanol which is very poisonous  and you took more than enough to kill yourself  the bad news is the alcohol you just drank  contains so much ethanol that its going to bind with that  nasty formic acid rampaging through your body  hence youre just gonna pee it out  harmlessly  chuckles  man you are drunk  yes i am i also saved your life  at least for now  laughlng  woman chatterinn on pa system  morning your head hurts  no you just have a very grating voice  you always were a lightweight  why are you talking to me  cant it be enough that i wanna cause you pain  the patients okay now youre gonna send him back  absolutely  can i trust you you used to  i still think the patients sick im keeping him here  yeah either you can do your job and keep the hospital informed  or you can help me make sure the hospital is not informed  and buy me some time  chase have you done a ct yeah i have  with contrast  shes done everything she needs to do except tell her patient that shes dying  i told you only i get to play with the markers  our prisoner has a new symptom  im not telling cindy shes dying until the diagnosis is confirmed  im not buying that clarence  was trying to take control of his life by suicide  healthy people dont kill themselves  healthy people dont kill other people  guy just filed an appeal in a state that hasnt actually killed anybody  in about 30 years  what if it wasnt suicide what if it was an escape plan  drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital try to escape from here  excellent  explains everything except the symptom that got him here  his heart went nuts before he got stuck in that storage cell  and chugged a toner martini  i think theres something going on in his head  check for intracranial lesions brain infections autoimmune diseases  do a ct lp full workup states paying so go nuts  foreman whered you get these scars  i got shivved my first month in after l healed up i got mines  you guys still think im sick  obviously  why do you care why dont you just let me die  well im different than you  right you love me like your own mama  thats why the nurse says you kicked her out when my heart nearly stopped  take a deep breath  groans  any family history of mental illness  i always heard my pop was crazy i never met the man  with my mom it was the drugs  any siblings  i got a brother pretty much raised him on my own  inspirational story he doing time too hey  hes a good kid dont go judging what you dont know  hows his health  i havent heard from him since i went inside  spent 16 years with him changed his damn diapers  can you imagine your whole life  being all about the worst thing you ever did  you killed four people  and somehow making mac and cheese just the way he wants  kind of loses its significance  oh no now youve left your entire body in my chair  what does that mean you want  i need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage  i take it the ct with contrast came back  theyre not definitive biopsy would be  biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary  and definitive  but you dont want definitive you want to hang onto your delusions  as long as you can  a lavage could prove its not cancer  but you need me to approve the procedure must be a bitch  the answer is no why  because its me  im over you ive jumped on the bandwagon  and i hate you okay  great lets treat her  what is it  you wont help cindy but youre obsessed with this piece of dirt  are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesnt matter  or that all that matters is your stupid puzzle  fine  treat them the same thats all im asking  one test  wow  that is remarkable  according to those patchouli oilselling new agers  its supposed to be the terminal patient  but youre going through the five stages  you just made a completely seamless transition from anger  to bargaining  cover two more of my clinic hours  and you can have your one procedure  no lesions no aneurysms  ironically the mind of a killer looks completely normal  if someone asked you to describe me to them  whats the first thing youd tell them  insecure  what are you asking  like if you were setting me up on a blind date  would you describe me to the girl as the black guy a neurologist  car thief  this guys really getting to you isnt he  theres no sign of infection  youre gonna have to do the biopsy  cuddy your death row guys still here  yeah sorry ive just gotta get him stabilized  probably keep him on fluids for a few more hours then off he goes  oh yeah cause im figuring that you still think hes sick  figuring requires deductive reasoning im figuring that you did no figuring  stacy just ratted me out right so much for attorneyclient privilege  im the client you moron stacy has a duty to this hospital  right im sending him back to prison  cant court order  court order says he has to be declared healthy  doesnt specify which doctor needs to make that declaration  clarence screamlng  what is it clarence my gut  would you describe it as a shooting pain  a throbbing pain  or maybe an imaginary pain because you dont want to go back to prison  where does it hurt my gut i feel like im getting stabbed  well hed know let me take a look  oh so everybody lies except a convicted murderer  i dont think hes faking this stuff  what do you think doctor  clarence groanlng  i didnt have any choice  no you had to tell cuddy shes your boss i get it  hitler thought he was doing the world a favor too  yeah pretty much on that same level  gandhi didnt march to the sea because his buddies asked him to  pol pot didnt wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends  youre not making friends right now  i trusted you i know  wilsons a fool im an idiot  i had to do what i thought was right  its the only reason anybody does anything  surgery went fine they removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel  theyre shackling him and taking him into recovery  i wonder  i wonder why clarence killed that second inmate  fine ill bite what the hell are you talking about  everything we do  is dictated by motive why did he kill his girlfriend  because hes a maniac is that the reason he gave  she was cheating on him  jealousy that gets him sent to prison  where he kills inmate number one why  guy attacked him first  revenge  whod he kill after that prison guard  who had a file full of abuse complaints  probably been kicking clarences ass for months  clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds  well call that one retribution  then he kills inmate number two  anybody know why  uhuh  its not in there  clarence all of a sudden i gotta have a reason  its an anomaly doctors love anomalies  dark spot on an xray bright spot on an mrl  killing that second inmate  was the homicidal equivalent of blood in the urine it doesnt fit  im interested in things that dont fit  tell me why you did it  your other victims you were almost bragging about  what was different about this guy  it happened when i was in gen pop  i was in the library just reading  and i started feeling real nervous this guy was staring at me  i could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck  made me feel crazy  sweat was pouring down my face  i could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears  i just raged out on the dude  so whats the differential for raging out  excess testosterone steroids adrenalin  prep clarence for surgery care to share with the class  oh come on do i have to spell it out for you pheochromocytoma  actually im not sure how you spell it  but you said it yourself adrenalin  pheochromocytoma sits on top of the adrenal gland  randomly spits out oodles of the stuff its perfect  it explains everything the tachycardia pulmonary edema the vasoconstriction that  caused the necrotic bowel  even explains how he had the strength to rip the rail off his bed  but pheos extremely rare i love rare  set up an mrl wheres cameron  like i dont know  woman laughlng  both chatterlng  dr cameron could l borrow you for a consult  bittersweet thing about being head of the oncology department  i get ccd on all the biopsy results  yeah i know  shes terminal yeah  so i take it you were in there informing her  well i hadnt exactly gotten around to that but i was just  doing what making friends  cindys divorced  she doesnt have any kids no siblings both her parents are gone  its not your job to be her friend do you understand  and its not worth it  she feels better her final few days and youre not the same maybe for years  you dont think its worth it i know its not worth it  my husband  i met him just after he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer  if i hadnt married him he was alone  when a good person dies there should be an impact on the world  somebody should notice  somebody should be upset  pheo what  i dont even remember  its just a fancy way of saying small adrenalinsecreting tumor  yeah that clarified it for you  all you need to know is if im right we can fix it  just gotta find it first  we need an mrl  its completely painless for most people  but not for me  i assume you got those tattoos in prison  prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals  the mrl is basically a giant magnet  suck those metallic inks right out of your skin  groanlng  screamlng  stop squirming  dont make us do this again  big baby  still dont see anything  clarence groanlng  clarence turn it off  theres waldo  found it clarence  turn it off  turn this damn thing off  keep him in there until you guys see it too  son of a bitch  looks like they got the pheo out successfully  so what now  clarence goes back to death row  just like that  hes cured  that tumor caused random shots of adrenalin  which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer  in the first place  my god youre right  lets call the surgeons we gotta save that tumor  put it on the witness stand  we could testify at clarences appeal  you smell that i think that is the stink of hypocrisy  you wouldnt even consider the notion that clarences social upbringing  was responsible for what he became but now youre sprinting to the witness stand  to blame everything on a little tumor  a persons upbringing and their biology are completely different  yeah  because you only overcame one of them  well lets just give clarence a free pass  which is probably gonna piss off all those other pheo sufferers  who managed to control their rage attacks  and become lawyers race car drivers or even doctors  removing that tumor puts a stop to those random shots of adrenalin  it doesnt absolve him  you want him to be executed  thats not what im saying  got an opinion  everyones got an opinion  i i think im gonna testify at clarences appeal  youll do what you think is right  on your own time  but its just a cough
