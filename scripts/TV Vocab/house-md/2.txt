                   on your right on your right on your right  back back back back back come on buddy  yeah dan yeah  yea  yea   back back back back back watch the winger    yeah  you okay  dan dan talk to me  dan dan  get a doctor   hey  close the door  close the door  is cuddy down the hall counting to 50  she knows im in here in the clinic as she commanded   she just doesnt know im alone  well youve got a full waiting room   how long do you think you can ignore them  im off at 400  youre doing this to avoid five minutes of work  if i go out there i get assigned a kid with a runny nose  thats 30 seconds looking at the nose  who wont leave until shes sure its not meningitis or a tumor  yes concerned parents can be so annoying  just tell cuddy youve got an urgent case you had to leave early that would be lying  and that would be wrong but luckily the definition ofurgent is fungible  not the definition ofcase though  you have no cases  you have no cases  youve got handpicked doctorsspecialists  working for you and theyre sitting on their hands   camerons answering my mail  oh time well spent im sure  foreman and chase  research    nine letters iodine deficiency in children  cretinism  so 403 pm dr house checks out  please write that down  dr house sorry done for the day  plenty of docs here to take care of you but we had an appointment  nice try but this is a walkin clinic which means there are no appointments  you walk in sign the chart and a doctor will see you  just not me your letter says that wed see you  not a big letter writer here  when did my signature get so girlie   i can explain  see that g  see how it makes a big loop on top  doesnt even look like my handwriting think i have something  whats the differential diagnosis for writing gs like a junior high school girl  its impossible to get to you through normal channels they have called emailed  perseverance does not equal worthiness next time you want to get my attention wear something fun  lowrider jeans are hot  sixteenyearold male sudden onset of double vision and night terrors with no apparent cause  the kids been to two neurologists and he night terrors   as in big scary monsters  yes   where are you going  to see the family   youre going to examine a patient  nine times out of 10 theres no reason to talk to a patient  but night terrors in a 16yearold is a very good reason to talk to this family  good work  margins are fine  no lesions  color is good  how long have you been having night terrors three weeks  hes afraid to go to bed hes exhausted can barely function   what does that tell you  nothing its just fun watching him blink  name as many animals as you can that begin with the letter b go   baby elephant  baby elephant is actually a good answer   b is a bear of a letter  what does that tell you  proves two things no neurological damage and your son is never gonna be chief fry cook  in teens there are two likely causes of night terrors   posttraumatic stress any recent shootouts at your high school  no   then dave  dan  if theres no trauma the other cause is sexual abuse  so whos molesting you teacher  extrafriendly neighbor id ask if either of you were involved but youd deny it  we would never hurt dan  i say it here it comes out there  this lack of response is consistent with abuse  theres no one okay l i swear  there was trauma i got hit in the head during a lacrosse game  did you know that he got hit in the head   they didnt mention it no  yeah why bother  no no we took him to the er after the game  he was scanned they tested him they said he was fine  no concussion its gotta be something else  you hound me for my opinion and then you question my diagnosis  cool er obviously screwed up kids got a concussion  i had double vision before i was hit well that changes everything  you need glasses thats why you had double vision  which is why you got hit which is why you have a concussion which is why you have night terrors  you need to see an ophthalmologist which i am not  you enjoyed that i brought a reasonable case to your attention and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me  youre an only child arent you why would you say that  because everything is about you  this may seem incredibly controversial but i think sexual abuse is bad  i just wanted to make sure he wasnt being diddled by daddy or mommy  anything else is just a bonus  im not an only child interesting  what dont move   did i bore you in there  what uh no not not really  are you tired   sometimes  he never sleeps of course hes tired   right now at this moment are you tired  no no  that twitch in your leg did you feel that   didnt hurt  his leg twitched i dont see what  its called a myoclonic jerk its very common when youre falling asleep  respiration rate falls and the brain sometimes interprets this as the body dying so it sends a pulse to wake it up   so  so hes not asleep  hes awake  admit him   i recognize that loopy g   so what does thejerk tell us  nothing good the brains losing control of the body  cant order the eyes to focus regulate sleep patterns or control muscles  a movement disorder or a degenerative brain disease  either way this kids gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair  maybe not that bad could be an infection  you wish no fever no white count  anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we dont have an accurate family history   i took an accurate family history  you didnt even take an accurate family   his fathers not his father  why would you say that  thirty percent of all dads dont realize theyre raising someone elses kid  false paternitys more like 10 thats what our moms would like us to believe  who cares if he got it from his parents theyd both be dead   can we get on with the differential diagnosis  fifty bucks says im right   ill take your money  hit a nerve   dont worry im sure the guy who tucked you in was your daddy  make it a hundred  what about leukoencephalopathy in a 16yearold  it doesnt necessarily have to be that bad  if we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic   his liver kidneys something outside the brain  yes   feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier  night terrors were anecdotal   he couldve had a bad dream  no parents said he was conscious during and didnt remember anything afterwards   thats a night terror  parents said   thats a good point  before we condemn this kid maybe we should entertain dr chases skepticism  i want a detailed polysomnograph if hes having night terrors i want to see them    i usually dont move during night terrors  im not restraining you for them  eeg revealed abnormalities in your brain  caused nerve damage in your toes  what are you doing   fixing it  can i talk to my parents  oh they know all about this  id really like to see them  please id really like them here  this is gonna hurt dan  oh oh god          thats a night terror   we did a c t mri cbc chem7 and chest xray  all the tests came back normal theres nothing to explain his symptoms  okay but lets pretend theres something and go from there who sees something on this mri  no lesions in the white matter no structural abnormalities  no spaceoccupying tumors  hes 16 so he should have an absolutely pristine brain the smallest thing is abnormal  meningeal enhancement   my bet is viral meningitis  excellent  do you see what he did there  took a small clue that theres a neurological problem and wasnt afraid to run with it  theres no evidence of meningitis on that mri  no theres not hes completely wrong  then what clue are you talking about  he knew that i saw something on the mri so he figured there must be something there and took a guess   clever but also pathetic  so what did you find  take a close look at the corpus callosum   looks okay  are we all looking at the same thing  two hundred million interhemispheric nerve fibers  the george washington bridge between the left and right side of the brain  its subtle  theres some bowing there  an upward arch are you guessing  yes   too bad youre right  he probably just moved  nobody stays perfectly still for the entire mri  yeah probably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position  something is pushing on it if there was bowing could be a tumor  do you see a tumor on this mri no but i dont see any bowing either  theres no tumor just a blockage causing pressure causing symptoms  today night terrors tomorrow hes bleeding out of his eyes  get him a radionucleotide cisternogram i guarantee youll see a blockage    okay  easy  okay squeeze my hand  all right squeeze hard     all right  now im injecting a material thats tagged with a radioisotope  its gonna enter your spine and travel up to your brain  itll make you able to think deep thoughts  run a hundred miles an hour  easy  their eyes arent the same color but that fleck in the eyes  thats maybe a onein10 chance if theyre not related  no house isnt gonna pay you based on that   any excuse we can give the folks to justify a dna test  we could tell them hes got huntingtons whole family should be tested or theyll all die    hey  theres a lot of blockage ive scheduled him for surgery  were gonna put a shunt into one of the ventricles to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out  no more pressure everything goes back to normal  hes lucky to have you as his doctors    no formula just mommys healthy natural breast milk  yummy  her whole face just got swollen like this overnight  mmhmm  no fever  glands normal missing her vaccination dates   were not vaccinating    gribbet gribbet  gribbet  think they dont work  i think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work  pad their bottom line mmhmm   may i  sure  gribbet gribbet  gribbet   yeah allnatural no dyes is a good business  allnatural childrens toys  toy companies they dont arbitrarily mark up their frogs  they dont lie about how much they spend on research and development  the worst that a toy company could be accused of is making a really boring frog     gribbet gribbet gribbet  you know another really good business  teeny tiny baby coffins  you can get em in frog green  fireengine red really  the antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for six months  which is why these companies think they can gouge you  they think that youll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive  want to change things prove em wrong  few hundred parents like you decide theyd rather let their kid die than cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination  believe me prices will drop really fast  gribbet gribbet gribbet gribbet gribbet  gribbet  tell me what she has  a cold   theres a problem  complications in surgery surgery went fine hes in recovery  but we took a vial of csf and tested it really  turns out the bowing wasnt the cause of his problems it was a symptom  oligoclonal bands and increased intrathecal igg  which means multiple sclerosis and the reason it takes three of you to tell me this  because were having a disagreement about whether or not it is ms  no lesions on the mri its early hes had the disease for maybe two weeks   mcdonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis  who cares about macphearson   i hear he tortured kittens  mcdonald  oh mcdonald wonderful doctor loved kittens  the vep indicates slowing of the brain   without the lesions we cant be sure  well if it is its gone from zero to 60 in three weeks  which would indicate rapidly progressive ms  not the fun ms with the balloons and the bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs   we should wait until  start treating him now  maybe he can walk for another couple of years maybe live for another five  break it to the family im going home   itll take months for a definitive diagnosis whatll happen to me  ms is an incredibly variable disease  if it is ms and were not a hundred percent sure  what do you think is gonna happen  there are some medications to manage the symptoms  but as the disease progresses the problems will become more severe  bowel and bladder dysfunction  loss of cognitive function pain  so its gonna hurt  the brains like a big jumble of wires  ms strips them of the insulation and the nerves die  brain interprets it as pain  but by starting treatment were gonna prevent that for as long as possible  were looking into a couple of specialists  and until we get you squared away youll stay here okay  security checked the videotapes from all perimeter cameras  hes still gotta be in the hospital wheres chase  main floor okay you take the cafeteria and administration  ill hit the research annex and work my way back to you    dan      im not here leave a message    dr cuddy great outfit  what are you doing back here patient  no hooker went to my office instead of my home    dr house  dans missing yeah i got that part from the message  you said i was needed immediately he shouldnt move after a lumbar puncture  i agree hes gonna have a very nasty headache  that would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning  we wanted to keep you informed he heard some pretty heavy news  this is not a toddler wandering around a department store  hes 16 youll find him  im going home  so when you say call me if you need anything you mean dont call  no i mean call me if i could do something  im bad at search parties and im bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing  what about his parents should we call them  why do you think theyre hiding him  make sure someone checks the roof  some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke   dan you okay  there are experimental treatments ongoing research  who knows what theyll discover in a year or two  this is where i dropped the ball  dan were standing on the roof of the hospital  dan  dan youre not on the field  he doesnt know where he is dan  foreman  dan   dan  dan no  dr foreman  i assume you found the kid  he almost walked off the roof suicidal  no he thought he was on his lacrosse field look i was gonna run home shower change  conscious yeah  howd you talk him down actually chase tackled him  how come you didnt do it  right well i am black but he was closer    come on you can ride up with me    anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof they must be thrilled  theyre not suing but i think only because chase asked  why does everybody always think im being sarcastic  this is great news he doesnt have ms  parents should be thrilled the mom anyway of course the dad probably doesnt know   why doesnt he have ms  he was on the roof thinking he was on a lacrosse field   conscious and therefore not a night terror you want some of this  yeah sure  he was in an acute confusional state  which doesnt fit with a demyelinating disease like ms  oligoclonal bands were real  they just mean something other than ms so what are they telling us  that the immune system is working right  he has an infection in his brain  what about sex  well it might get complicated i mean we work together   im older certainly but maybe you like that  i meant maybe he has neurosyphilis   huh nice cover  sorry rpr was negative   we dont need a definitive test to confirm sure didnt need one to confirm ms  okay lets wait for you to run titers on 1400 viruses while this kids brain turns to mush  so the fact that he doesnt have ms its its really not good news after all  well it is if its neurosyphilis  the likelihood of a false negative on an rpr test 30  likelihood of a 16yearold having sex roughly 120  ill start him on iv penicillin were not gonna wait for that  the most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine  we cant in a cramped space like the brain  increased intracranial pressure from a highvolume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem  itd kill him no neurologist in his right mind would recommend that  show of hands who thinks im not in my right mind  and who thinks i forget this fairly basic neurological fact  who thinks theres a third option   very good whats the third choice  no idea you just asked if i thought there was one  the patient has a shunt in his brain therell be no increased pressure  we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want  excellent inject him through a lumbar puncture  one of us is gonna do this to you twice a day for the next two weeks     im ready go  he could get syphilis  even if hes not sexually active  well its its unusual but its possible  okay relax  its infected with a really big hole  like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure  i wouldnt do that although the wound is irregular  its not cylindrical its shaped like a triangle so not a nail   steak knife  wifes nail file  nail file  yeah pain will make you do stupid things   something to take the edge off  yeah  cheers  so you have family here in princeton  no here on work   no why are you  does your penis hurt  no what should it  no just thought id toss you a really inappropriate question   your lawyers gonna love it  why would i want to sue you i want you to treat me   youre from maplewood new jersey right  yeah  now why would you drive 70 miles  to get treatment for a condition that a nineyearold could diagnose  its the freeflowing pus thats the tipoff  i was in town not for family not for work  you drove 70 miles to a walkin clinic you passed two hospitals on the road  either youve got a problem with those hospitals or they have a problem with you  my guess is youve sued half the doctors in maplewood  and the rest are now refusing to help you  its ironic isnt it sort of like the boy who sued wolf  you know i bet we have a doctor here named wolf  how perfect would that be   im gonna page him  okay you know what thank you  im gonna find a doctor to take care of this  i didnt say i wouldnt treat you   well drain your knee run some lab work fix you up  why would you do that  im a people person   you actually treated him  all i know is he sued some doctors  who am i to assume they didnt have it coming to them  the cutest little tennis outfit my god i thought i was gonna have a heart attack  oh my didnt see you there that is so embarrassing hows your hooker doing  sweet of you to ask funny story  she was gonna be hospital administrator but just hated having to screw people like that   heard you found her on the roof  you have very acute hearing  you notify the parents  in due course of course  and is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient  doesnt sound like me well it does actually but doesnt mean youre guilty  you think i saw the parents in the lobby   smart moneys obviously on the father  my guy knows a guy who can get you in for 50 bucks  fine tell your guy if i win you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie  and if i win no clinic hours for a week  my guy will call your guy  shes very good at her job   the treatments should start helping soon  let us know if it gets easier to focus on things remember stuff  hey dan isnt dr camerons necklace a beauty  something south american i think  yeah guatemalan  its a cool necklace   thank you so much  the kids in pain   dont fight it just let it happen no   youll be dead in two days no what   i give it a day dan you okay  dan    night terrors  decomposition once hes in the grave    say goodbye to your mother and father  hes hearing voices   youre dying its all over dan  youre dying dying dead  push two milligrams iv ativan stat    its all over  come on dan  get out of my head  auditory hallucination shows further brain degeneration  penicillins not working so either its a bad batch of penicillin  or our diagnosis is wrong  square one  midnite  lf ts bun and creatinine are all normal   diabetes is out and no gap  there goes metabolic   mra rules out vasculitis  l for inflammation   too young for anything degenerative  d see ya  n for neoplastic mri was clean   l for inflammation  we already did that   stupid to have two is in one mnemonic whats the other one  infection   oligoclonal bands still have to mean something  but no fevers white counts elevated but within range  weve tested for anything remotely possible everythings negative   ct scan rules out subdural  trauma later much  you know the problem midnightis actually spelled with a gand an h   if we could just figure out what those letters stand for  its a sick brain having fun  torturing him talking to him  scaring the hell out of him  get him an eeg left and right eog esophageal microphones  if this thing wants to talk lets listen  were missing something this is screwedup  thats why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing  i panicked okay  sounded cool though they bought it  oh crap  another reason i dont like meeting patients if they dont know what you look like they cant yell at you  here we go  how can you just sit there  if i eat standing up i spill  our son is dying and you could care less  were going through hell youre doing nothing   im sorry you need to vent i understand  dont be condescending  you havent checked in on him once  blood pressure is 110 over 70  his shunt is patent wellplaced in the right lateral ventricle  the ekg shows a normal q rs with deepwave inversions throughout both limb and precordial leads  lf ts are elevated but only twice the normal range  oh yeah and hes hearing voices  go hold his hand  go on ill bus your tray     got any sample bags on you  i dont believe you  youre gonna run dna tests their son is deathly ill  i know its terrible but the fact is if i dont keep busy with trivial things like this  im afraid i might start to cry youre an ass  yeah you want to double the bet  general hospital is on channel 6  dans brains not showing channel 6 right now only mush  no epileptiform activity  what are you doing waiting for cbc and chem7  good run dna on these  whats this parents coffee cups  i cant believe you ive had this conversation once already  if youve got something else to do do it otherwise do this  dr house hey mr funsten  i was wondering when youd be back you got some papers for me  youve caused me considerable mental distress i certainly hope so  what too cheap to get your lawyer to serve it for you or is it just more fun this way  im obviously prepared to consider a settlement  you have gonorrhea  no i dont well maybe youre right but i have the lab result says you do  could be a false positive and normally id run a second test  but since youre here ill just go with the first youre just trying to scare me  its reportable you know public health issue ill be sure to let my wife know  dont bother yourself the state will call for you  if youre clean im sure itll all blow over no big deal  theres an easy way to find out get one of your doctors to run a test  uhuh  these are mine now ill see you in court   west nile negative not surprising since not too many mosquitoes passing through jersey in december  no eastern equine encephalitis you guys arent gonna believe this  whats that house is right the fathers not the father   dude doubled up on me  youre not gonna believe this  the mothers not the mother either  its not a good idea to move your son in his condition   we just want a second opinion   we need an answer  you idiots you lied to me  we didnt lie about anything   you on the other hand accused us of molesting our son  perfect  can we get off my screwups and focus on theirs  theirs is bigger youre not dans parents  were his parents he was adopted he doesnt need to know   i do  adoption makes us just as much  listen when we were taking his medical history were you confused  did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition  or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world  how did you find out about this   i sampled their dna  we didnt give you any dna  your coffee cups from the cafeteria   you cant do that  again why are we getting hung up on what i did   your medical history is useless  no we gave you a detailed history of his biological mother  her history nonsmoker good health  low cholesterol no blood pressure problems  dan was adopted two weeks after he was born   you have his history theres nothing you need to know that we didnt tell you  sounds reasonable  well if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice  i still think its the wrong was she vaccinated  the biological mother when she was a baby did she get her vaccinations  dan was vaccinated at six months  mmhmm do you know why kids get vaccinated at six months  because before that they are protected  by their biological mothers immune system  so was she vaccinated   an infant picks up a regular old measles virus  gets a rash  hes extremely uncomfortable has a wicked fever but he lives  heres the kicker once every million or so times  the virus mutates  instead of dan having a fever and a rash  the virus travels to his brain and hides  like a time bomb  in this case for 16 years  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  i know theres only been in the last 30 years  i suppose you could make an argument the kids still in stage i  once sspe moves to stage ii its  boom stage ii is universally fatal  i assume its impossible to know when he might move into stage ii  hes already started showing symptoms could be a month could be tonight  can we treat it ask the neurologist  intraventricular interferon  not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis   tap him  we wont get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his csf  not after everything weve given him  so the wrong treatment kills any hope of the right diagnosis  why do people lie to me   could also kill him  your ball foreman tell me i dont have to biopsy his brain  well there is one other way  you sure this isnt gonna hurt  yeah its just scary as hell  see we go through the pupil  but you wont feel it the eyes been paralyzed  the needle travels to the back of the eye  which is where well perform the biopsy on your retina  so weve confirmed that the problem is this mutated virus  the treatment for sspe is intraventricular interferon  we implant an ommaya reservoir under the scalp  which is connected to a ventricular catheter  that delivers the antiviral directly to the left hemisphere  you want us to consent to this i dont even understand what youre talking about  well the antiviral  look im sorry  i can explain this as best i can but the notion that youre gonna fully understand your sons treatment  and make an informed decision is is kind of insane  heres what you need to know  its dangerous  it could kill him  you should do it      did you need something else  you cant order a 3200 dna test to win a bet  its not an actual cost  i dont know if you know this but the hospital actually owns the sequencing machine   im serious  tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance  insurance is not gonna pay for a bet  should we dont make that bet the kid dies  if not for the paternity bet i never would have taken their dna  without their dna we never would have discovered that dan was adopted which was the key to this case  you just dont want to pay your end  big mistake my guy knows a guy  fine i will let you out of clinic duty for one week  after you pay the 3200 for the pcr test  ooh  well now theres the hundred you owe me  heres a hundred i won from cameron   and 600  i got from wilson  very bitter   hey good morning  good news on your eeg treatment is working  and your immune system is responding  i know its early but i just want to take a look  all right lets see what that brain of yours can do  name as many animals as you can that start with the letter o  ostrich  ox old elephant  well thats two better than last time  how you doing with the whole adoption thing   i knew since fifth grade  hows that  cleft chin  i have one my dad doesnt  looked it up on the internet its one of those trait things  thats right its autosomal dominant  since neither of your parents have cleft chins its highly unlikely youre biologically related   are you sure youre okay  ive got no problems with being adopted  i love my parents  hows he doing hes doing pretty well  hes a smart kid  i think hes gonna be fine   hey  thanks    wheels 18 wheels    thats some bad hat harry
