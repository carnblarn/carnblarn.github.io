                so now the plan is either find ourselves a new counselor  stick it out with the old one but go more often  or resign ourselves to the fact that shes never gonna be happy  no matter what i do so lets take the money were wasting and put it towards a membership at lakeview   im guessing the last option has yet to be formally presented yeah  geez whats with you you usually run half speed to stay with me  didnt get a lot of sleep last night    how are things with elyse great  great yeah  onesyllable answers youre either out of breath or youre lying to me  yeah we have our moments but they usually work out  man you got some water yeah  so how do you work things out  i dont know we talk someone apologizes  man i shouldnt have drank last night   hey you mean you apologize  yeah i guess   how often do you guys have sex  enough  you do it this morning  you did you did it this morning   maybe thats why you cant stand up huh come on   elyse  great  honey im dehydrated  do we have anything with electrolytes  sleeping beauty wake up   this is an emergency  the fridge is empty   come on its almost 400   elyse sweetie  calljacques tell him im not feeling well  its saturday you havent been to work in three days remember  just let me sleep  come on you havent been out of bed since wednesday   leave me alone  come on whats up  no leave me alone  honey i said leave me alone  oh i think theres something wrong with me  shes been averaging 18 hours of sleep a day since her admission  clinical depression incredibly contagious  every time im around one of them i get blue its not clinical depression  great got it all figured out you dont need me  three er doctors two neurologists and a radiologist have all figured out what its not  we need to figure out what it is if any of the abovementioned doctors  were interested in my opinion they would have asked for it  none of them are willing to subject themselves to you  no pain no gain   the blood work shows no signs of inflammation  and no one can figure out whats actually the cause ah  what husband described her as being unusually irritable recently  and i didnt realize it was possible for a woman to be unusually irritable    nice try but youre a misanthrope not a misogynist  whats the first thing you ask a doctor whos referring a patient  are you questioning my ability to take a history  whats the primary not what why  diseases dont have motives no but doctors do  why this patient what interests you  give me the chart why  lfind your interest interesting   shes irritable and sleeping  whats interesting about that  hypersomnias usually accompanied by irritability in depressed patients  true but not relevant shes not depressed  hello shes sleeping fever  clinical depression does not cause fever   she could be sick and depressed  shes sick  oh damn it why didnt i think of that   yeah thats what i meant  elevated sed rate indicates inflammation  hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain  not the spleen  thank goodness we hired a neurologist  brain symptoms hmm could this be a brain problem  no other systemic signs of inflammation probably not vasculitis  what about parasites malaria chagas  but the patients never been outside of the united states especially the tropics   you mean she claims shes never been outside the us  very good  doesnt matter blood and csf smears show no sign of parasites   has to be a tumor then  a tumor sitting directly on top of the brain stem  that three er doctors two neurologists and a radiologist missed  partridge in a pear tree missed it too  redo the blood work and get a new mri with twomillimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic  and check for evil stepmothers  this much sleep usually indicates poison apples  anything else besides the shortness ofbreath  not really its actually just kind of a tightness  you smoke no never   exercise  eight hours a day   i teach preschool  sounds fun  any history of heart disease in your family  not that i know of take a deep breath  been under a lot of stress lately no more than usual  youre probably just a little anemic  im gonna do an ekg just to make sure  do i need to take this off uh no you can just pull that down in front  good lord   are those real  do they look real  they look pretty damn good  they were a present for my husbands 40th  lfigured hed enjoy them more than a sweater  thats so sweet  but im afraid the cause of your problem could be staring us right in the face  actually i guess im the one doing the staring  of course i cant be sure id like to consult a colleague  hes actually somewhat of an expert in these matters  can i get a page on dr wilson  a tumor we dont know   were checking just to be safe  yall already checked for that  the previous mri had a broader view some tumors are almost impossible to see unless you know exactly where to look   that means it would be small right  yeah  then youd be able to operate take it out  if its a tumor there are a variety of treatment options  but there are variables other than just size  dont worry  too late   try to remain as still as possible  the less distortion there is the more detail well be able to see okay   xray tech report to radiology room 3  well thats what breasts look like  is a lie a lie if everybody knows its a lie  well if a tree pretends to fall in a forest house come on theyre breasts  theyre a birthday present not a philosophical treatise lie number one  she did not do that for her husband she did that for herself  she thinks if she looks different shell be different  no she thinks if she looks different shell be more attractive which i have to say  not to her husband cosmetic surgery is so everyone else will look at us differently  the same reason youre wearing that tie  well exactly that was gonna be my next point  last three months same five ties  thursday should be that paisley thing  its a gift from my wife no its not  julie hates green you bought that yourself  you want to look pretty at work   wilsons got a girlfriend  d stop  stop i dont  it takes two department heads to treat shortness of breath  what do the complications increase exponentially with cup size  i want an ekg and blood tests including tox screen on mrs    exam room one  youre ordering tests to cover your lechery   interesting  very tricky case  you love everybody thats your pathology  there were no lesions and no mass effect that we could see  what does that mean  it means were still not sure whats causing the neurological problems  i know some things are hard to cure  but what i just dont get is why its taking so long to figure out whats wrong with her   i know youre scared i would be too  i dont feel good  you feeling nauseous  honey are you all right   shes seizing  get her on her side   i need some ativan   ill get it   whats happened  shes having a seizure     shes aspirating suction     come on elyse    the mri reveals nothing    that we were able to detect  its not a tumor  a small glioma could hide from contrast we could do a petscan  yes thats how a responsible doctor would waste his time in this situation  suddenly tests and radiologists are incapable of error  a glioma not presenting on a contrast mri would have to be smaller than a grain of sand  which does not a gravely ill person make   it could be just postictal disorientation  we would have seen improvement by now   latestage lyme disease can cause seizures  does the husband care about her   he hasnt left her bedside  how annoying  it also means she doesnt have lyme disease  what love conquers all  lyme disease initially presents with a rash   mr clingy would have noticed  weve looked at everything else  did you look at her breasts   men  it could be paraneoplastic  she have any family history of breast cancer  her mother died of it  the brain but not the brain  clever huh  how can breast cancer cause problems in her brain  there are molecular similarities between brain cells and tumor cells  paraneoplastic syndrome causes the bodys own antibodies to get thrown off track  they end up attacking the brain instead of the tumor  so if you do find a tumor what do you do  we treat the underlying malignancy  once theres no tumor to attack theres nothing for the antibodies to get confused about   if the tumors treatable  exactly    ow im sorry i know its uncomfortable  the tighter we go the better the image will be    at least itll keep me awake dont worry its almost over  i wish people would stop telling me not to worry   im sorry  my mom was the same age      weve been trying to get pregnant for over a year guess were lucky we didnt  a lot has changed since your mom died  dont worr  dont give up     no tumor  the mri and the mammogram only showed a few benign calcifications  its most likely a smallcell tumor  its no surprise were having trouble finding it  we should do a pet scan start with her lungs then maybe her bones  sometimes it presents with no tumor at all   how can a disease caused by a tumor present if theres no tumor  it happens 12 of cases   and how do you treat it if theres no tumor  you dont  those 12 no treatment  they were too busy looking for the tumor  right till they put the patient in the ground   what choice do we have  treat the symptoms   iv immunoglobulin  so were just gonna ignore the tumor  well eventually itll get bigger then itll be really easy to find   one of you needs to check out where she works  why   cause the husbands not sick   meaning  if its not paraneoplastic and it is a reaction to some sort of toxin  its obviously not coming from their home  foreman you do it  why are you riding me its what i do  has it got worse lately yeah seems to me  really  well that rules out the race thing cause you were just as black last week  how long has elyse worked here  oh three years shes my best rotisseur  and whats that the rotisseur prepares the roasted meats and gravies  how do you clean your grill   you say elbow grease do you use chemical cleaners  ah non absolument and chefs dont do the cleaning anyway  what about pesticides you must spray for roaches and that sort of thing  no my kitchen is clean no roaches     i need to get back to work  so the fact that im here asking you these questions it doesnt worry you   look at me im here 18 hours a day  that guy practically lives here he does live here  i use the same detergents for 15 years and everyone is healthy as a horse  whatever elyse has she didnt get here  tell her i hope she feels better  and i had to get a new rotisseur   wheres ed  he went down to the gift shop to buy a shirt  i told him id stay up here in case you woke up  you must have better things to do  i send my laundry out   youre not married  no  waiting for the perfect guy  let me guess youve already found him  he threw my towels out the window   thats how we met  freshman year ed came to a party that my roommate and i threw  he spent most of the night on the bathroom floor  he figured i wouldnt notice the vomit on the towels if i didnt have any towels  im assuming he came back the next day to apologize  no way i had to track him down   conflict resolution has never been one of eds strong points  nobodys perfect right  i guess  oh my neck hurts  youve been in this bed for a really long time  were gonna do the same test we did last night okay do you know what day it is  my arm itches its probably a mild skin irritation ill get you some hydrocortisone in a minute   do you know what day it is  tuesday  it really itches  how about i get you that cream right now  oh my god get them off get em off of me   get em off me get em off me  elyse calm down   get them off me  elyse calm down calm down  theyre biting me oh theyre biting me  im gonna need some haldol five milligrams   honey whats wrong  get em off  get em off get em off theres nothing there elyse  theyre biting me theres nothing there  ow   we had to sedate her  you gave sedatives to a patient whos already sleeping  it was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms   wheres wilson  creepycrawlies are consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome  onset immediately after ivig isnt  there is a simple explanation  maybe she really has bugs under her skin   infection  thats what a worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest  blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria  patient throws up on your shoes do you clean up most of it  the symptoms rule out the rest serology rules out viruses  csf smears rule out parasites  in the final stage of african trypanosomiasis  almost all the parasites are inside the brain  its possible they wouldnt show on smears  but its not possible for a patient whos never been to africa to have african sleeping sickness   im just saying it fits the symptoms  she couldve got it from a transfusion   or im just saying she couldve got it from a transfusion  which she never had  okay  what about toxins  no the kitchen she works in is cleaner than some hospitals  but they do serve rabbit  rabbit fever fits her symptoms  tularemia initially presents with a rash or ulcer near the infection site  not if she inhaled it chopping the meat with the cleaver could easily aerosolize the bacteria   no then shed have respiratory symptoms  maybe she ignored it figured she had a cold  we rejected lyme disease because the couple would have noticed a rash  but a wet hacking cough is just gonna slip right by  its either that or she missed her exit on the turnpike and wound up in africa  okay two lousy ideas  unfortunately theyre better than all the other ideas  tularemia bizarre  very nice thats why i ride you   stay tuned did he just turn on the tv  he needs to think  so this should tell us whether or not shes got rabbit fever  for a diagnosis of tularemia you need a fourfold increase in serum antibody levels  to measure an increase you need a before all we have is an after   a single titer over 160 would be a big clue  thats why i ride you  what does that mean when i have a good idea its because ofhim  actually i think he said your idea was a lousy idea  it has to be one of these two conditions i say we take our best guess and start treatment or treat both  the treatment for tularemia can cause aplastic anemia   how come he doesnt ride you guys  got a crush on you   he just doesnt know how to show it  get over it he rides everybody   the treatment for sleeping sickness kills one in 10 patients  we start with the safer treatment  by safer you mean the one thats slightly less likely to kill her  foreman got the gang testing for tularemia   yep  probably inconclusive but worth doing  so whats her name when do i get to meet her   theres nobody give it up  your lips say no  your shoes say yes well theyre french   you cant trust a word they say  solid yet stylish  a professional woman would be impressed  im thinking accountant actuary maybe  its somebody in the hospital  patient  no chemos not sexy daughter of a patient  she would certainly have the neediness you need  im not gonna date a patients daughter  very ethical of course most married men would say they dont date at all  there was no date  i had lunch with one of the nurses  its her first time in an oncology unit shes having a tough time emotionally   perfect  i wanted to be nice  thats all i mean it  you always do its part of your charm  hi boys  mrs campbells test results  you remember her the preschool teacher with the heart of silicone  no doesnt ring a bell  they came in yesterday i figured you guys would have been all over them i know how concerned you were  shes all upset cause we paid more attention to the other girl  you check out her ass ive got the chest  the tests were normal of course thats just my opinion  you might wanna call a couple of guys from maintenance in for a consult  you check her ekg results before she left the other day   you ordered it  youre the responsible one   whats wrong they look normal to me  where is she   waiting downstairs why  i was right  do i have to get rid of the implants  surprisingly no  but your ekg shows a slightly decreased heart rate  is that a problem you told me you hadnt changed your diet or exercise were you lying  lying does your husband have high blood pressure  my husband yeah you see  if youre gonna repeat everything i say this conversations gonna take twice as long  yes he was diagnosed six months ago  he do a lot of cooking not really other than oatmeal in the morning  did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately  wait are you saying that that it looks like your husband  stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with the brown sugar  you think my husbands trying to poison me no nothing like that  he just doesnt want to have sex with you  decreased sex drive is one of the most common side effects of the betablockers hes been taking  im guessing he figured if youre both frigid no harm no foul  shouldve gotten him the sweater thats ridiculous  fine but if youre still concerned about the shortness of breath id start making your own breakfast  wait  what should i do  if you care about your husband at all id do the responsible thing  buy yourself some condoms go to a bar find  huh    lab tests inconclusive  not surprisingly no but too bad  luckily i have the answer   to what  thanks for asking  to life itself sex anything that can be transmitted via the blood can be transmitted through sex   sleeping sickness from sex  its not without precedent  im pretty sure it is unless youre talking about going to africa and having sex with a tsetse fly  a portuguese man was diagnosed three years ago with cns affected sleeping sickness  his only connection with africa was through a girlfriend whod served with the military in angola  boy whered you find that  thejournal of the instituto de higiene e medicina tropical   you dont read portuguese  you do  pretty sure thats what it said either that or it was an ad for sunglasses  her husband has never been to africa either  oh stymied again your logic is bulletproof  i think ignoring respiratory symptoms is more likely than cheating  because theyre completely devoted to each other  because they love each other  or  theyre overcompensating for guilt   find out which it is  you want me to ask a man whose wife is about to die if he cheated on her  no i want you to be polite and let her die  actually i dont want you to ask her anything foreman take the husband chase take the wife  you dont trust me to do my job  we all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear  and how exactly do you reformulate have you screwed around  did you know shes been trying to get pregnant yes  after you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago lfigured that was your thing  but youve never been prescribed folic acid and you cant lose a baby if youve never been pregnant  you pulled my medical records you coughed the other day i was concerned  you were curious like an eightyearold boy with a puzzle thats just a little too grownup for him to figure out  tomayto tomahto  so its either uh sleeping sickness or this rabbit thing  theyre both fatal without treatment  and unfortunately the treatment for both is extremely dangerous  are there tests you can do not at this stage  but each condition has a unique history  were hoping your answers to a few questions will help us  sure whatever you need to know  before the sleeping problems did you have any trouble breathing  a cough that wouldnt go away anything like that  no  are you certain  absolutely  ive never been away from her for more than a night  if she had breathing troubles i wouldve noticed  the other condition is significantly more likely if  if youve had an affair  have you ever had an affair  of course not   are you sure  i think id remember cheating on my wife  you might be reluctant to admit it no  i just want to be perfectly clear  if your wife has sleeping sickness and we dont treat her  shell die  i would never do that to ed  i love him  absolutely not  i love her  all right  all right then they say no cheating we cross off sleeping sickness  any new ideas  okay we go with foremans tularemia  start her on iv chloramphenicol four times a day  good night    wheres ed right next to you  well youre two down two to go  two days  no doses you have about  what time is it  about 400 am i pulled the short straw  flow rate looks good  no rash or flushing  what time is it   do you not remember just asking  i dont  elyse  elyse elyse   elyse  what are you doing   im trying to wake her  she fall asleep again  in the middle of a sentence elyse elyse    whats happening  patients not responding  pulse is fine airways open  check her blood pressure  pupils are reactive  elyse wake up you gotta wake up   what does that mean what are you doing  shes unresponsive to pain  come on elyse   is she dying  i dont know  shes in a coma  theres only one way a tularemia patient goes into a coma  while on iv chloramphenicol  the patient doesnt have tularemia and then there was one  patient comes in cause shes sleeping too much  it takes 10 doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness and then there was none  we still have the problem of explaining how a white chick from jersey  whos never traveled south of dc has african sleeping sickness  still have the obvious explanation  i made it clear if this guys lying about sleeping around he knows hes murdering his wife  does seem unlikely  go away    what are you doing  checking for lymphadenopathy  and waiting for you who are you  im dr house  your wife has human african trypanosomiasis  sleeping sickness you mean its not tularemia  a virus tumor or or cancer  no  ive never had an affair  i believe you  and i trust elyse  the treatment for this disease is a drug thats  fatal on its own 10 of the time  which is why i need your written consent before i can legally prescribe it  why would she lie if she knew it could kill her i dont ask why patients lie  i just assume they all do  but why to protect you  because she didnt think it mattered it just seemed easier because  thats what people do  if youre absolutely certain that your wife has never had sex with anyone but you  since you were married then im wrong  but if you think theres a possibility that just one time  she wasnt perfect  one weekend youre out of town  one fight where she ran to a friend  one stupid christmas party  then you need to allow me to start treatment  because if we dont  shes gonna be dead by tomorrow morning  you trust your wife that much  i dont know  im gonna start the treatment  glass syringes and special iv tubing  why do we need this stuff because melarsoprol melts plastic  this stuffs basically arsenic mixed with antifreeze  what doesnt kill us makes us stronger huh  nietzsche wouldnt have been so glib if hed been prescribed melarsoprol  can cause vomiting abdominal pain  blood toxicity neural damage cardiac arrhythmia  they forgot to say its gonna hurt like all hell   shes lucky shes in a coma  how long before we know if its working its tough to say  its a good sign that she hasnt gotten any worse  does she even know im here  she knows youre always there for her  yeah  if she gets better  it means she wasnt always there for me  it means she made a mistake  i cant help it  part of me a big part of me cant handle that  it doesnt want her to get better  does that make me a terrible person  yes    so youre treating her for african sleeping sickness  because you dont think its possible for someone to be faithful in a relationship  and you do yes  and you need to tell me that  look i am not having an affair  i had lunch with someone i work with at work once  i believe you what i dont believe is itll be just once  i love my wife you certainly love saying it   im sorry i know you love your wife  you loved all your wives probably still do  in fact you probably love all the women you loved who werent your wife  you can be a real jerk sometimes you know that yeah and youre the good guy  at least i try as long as youre trying to be good you can do whatever you want  and as long as youre not trying you can say whatever you want so between us we can do anything  we can rule the world   mixing up some margaritas  mines a double senorita  thats portuguese you know spanish  uhoh  whats goin on  im recalibrating the centrifuge  turn around  its a very sad thing  an uncalibrated centrifuge  makes me cry too im not crying  okay  i told the husband he was a jerk  why  when i was in college l  i fell in love and i got married  and  at that age the chances of marriage lasting  it lasted six months  thyroid cancer metastasized to his brain  there was nothing they could do  i was 21 and  i watched my husband die  im sorry  but thats not the whole story  its a symptom not your illness  thyroid cancer would have been diagnosed at least a year before his death  you knew he was dying when you married him  it must have been when you first met him  and you married him anyway  you cant be that good a person and welladjusted  why  cause you wind up crying over centrifuges  or hating people       her fever spiked at 104  echo shows global hyperkinesis  blood pressure barely 90 over 40  did you give her dopamine started 270 micrograms per minute 10 minutes ago  still no change  killing the parasites isnt gonna do much good if we kill her heart at the same time  a heart can be replaced a brain cant  right now were killing both  if shes gonna die we should at least let her do it without that acid flowing through her veins  whats happening  we wouldve expected your wifes condition to show some improvement by now  it hasnt  its going the other way  please dont die  please dont die      shes awake  hey shes gonna be okay  yeah sure  what are you gonna do  were you always honest with her  do you know how lucky you are your wife is alive she loves you  what she did  you cant love a person and do that to them  she loves you    i need to know who you had the affair with  he has to be notified so he can get treatment as well  why did you lie to us  you knew your life was at stake  hes not coming back is he  we all make mistakes  and we all pay a price  i need that name    hey there how you doin  fine  do you know where your dad is  can i help you  thats some bad hat harry
