my stack is bigger than your stack  you in or out  you know that relative to their size gorillas have smaller testicles than humans  well then youd probably have an edge over a gorilla but not over me  the reason is primate teste size inversely corresponds to the fidelity of our females  do you think there might be a better time to annoy me about my wife   im talking about poker  right  women are evil youre right to drive them away  call fold or raise story time can wait  were smaller and better than chimps  bigger and worse than gorillas  for all our rationality supposed trust and fealty to a higher power  our ability to create a system of rules and laws  our baser drives are more powerful than any of that  we want to control our emotions but we cant  if were happy things dont annoy us  if on the other hand were sitting on crappy hole cards  little tiny things annoy us a whole lot more  i raise  so are you going to tell me an annoying story every time i raise  god that would be annoying  i call  dr cuddy got one of your patients in the er  ian alston six years old  ah oh i know him whats the problem im all in  bloody diarrhea hemodynamically stable but hes been developing some coordination problems  it sounds like gastroenteritis and dehydration  order fluids and ill take it on my service  cuddy bets to you house  they scan his head   no why would they scan  dont play games   you gonna call  hows the heart rate  stable  im sorry house its gastroenteritis  im not going anywhere  put the order in and have someone tell alan and sarah that ill be up when im done  you in or out  im out  stone cold bluff  you might want to spend a little more time paying attention to your cards  and a little less time staring at my breasts  they dont match either  im going to take some air  follow my finger with your eyes  how  much longer will dr cuddy be  well given the number of mojitos  shes knocking back at the party id say its gonna be at least three hours before shes even conscious  werent you at the same party  i dont drink  i want you to reach out and grab my cane  whats wrong  your sons brain is losing control of his muscles  dr cuddys message said it was just dehydration from the diarrhea  shes  wrong  is he going to be all right  i dont know  so were you in one of those cages  no  no no no those are for tourists  you were in the water with a great white  sure  its no big deal you just have to keep an eye on them  if they get too close punch em in the nose  send them on their way   i had you going  you are mean  hey hows that anal fissure  did  it heal yet or is it still draining  oh im sorry i didnt realize you came back for seconds  i figured that after that girl in the stairwell youd be done for the night  hes joking  no adams apple small hands its no surprises this time  ill uh see you later  got a case  well you couldve just said that you didnt have to screw with me  yeah but if i didnt screw with you youd spend the whole night thinking you might get laid  which means youd be useless better to extinguish all hope  get foreman and cameron and meet me upstairs stat  whats so urgent  two cases same symptoms  what do 6yearolds and  their immune systems dont work as well could be listeria  i already checked for that  leukemia has a higher prevalence in both the young and old  cameron so does asthma  house no no no  they can both get diabetes  no  the nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle  its weird  some kind of circle of life thing  this kid doesnt have kidney failure  he will  based on this file the kid just ate some bad food  was the old man  they were nowhere near each other in any of the four dimensions   this case is 12 years old  yep   and this case is cuddys  she assigned it to me  she agrees with you that this is something more than gastroenteritis  she wouldnt have assigned it to me if she did now would she  gohhh  what were we talking about  two patients with two symptoms in common  and five symptoms not in common  while you were all wearing your frankie says relax tshirts  i was treating a 73yearold woman  who went through this progression of symptoms  the last of which was  in case any of you missed that class in med school that ones untreatable  kids got the first two  took esther an hour and 20 minutes to go from two to three  and less than a day to make it all the way to the rear exit  this is all because a child has some blood in his diarrhea  hes got a tummy ache  if there was any reason to think it was anything worse cuddy would be all over it  great do a colonoscopy  on a sixyearold kid who probably has nothing worse than some food poisoning  if you happen to find any purple papules do me a favor and grab a slice  i want to check for erdheim chester  a disease that there have been what maybe 200 reported cases of ever  if esthers family had let me do an autopsy  thered be 201  foreman see anything  chase no and i dont expect to  house usually avoids cases  if hes actually stealing a case from cuddy theres got to be a reason  its not the first time ive seen this file  about a month before cameron was hired  some trucker came in here with these symptoms  house decided he was dying  two days and a spinal tap bone marrow extraction and three colonoscopies later  we sent the guy home with a bunch of pain killers and a diagnosis of a bad cheese sandwich  one of the guys who worked here before me said house tried to cure esther at least three other times  you know how people see the virgin mary in danishes and stuff  someone died 12 years ago and house doesnt know why  house sees that case now in paint peeling in clouds and now in this poor kid  erdheim chester is an abnormal growth of some of the cells that fight infection  is that cancer cause he seems okay now  yeah the other doctor kind of scared us about that  he shouldnt have were just testing itll probably be negative  alan i dont understand  you dont think thats what it is but you want to  you want to do this thing to him anyway  we need to be sure  isnt there any other way  it shouldnt take long  all right  those ridges look a lot like purple papules  theyre not purple theyre red theyre probably just blood blisters  give me the biopsy needle  how long is this going to take  forget it chase your punchingouttheshark storys good but shes not waiting for you  so  we couldnt confirm the source of the bleeding   but we did biopsy some  blood blisters  you mean papules  come on cameron whos right  chase is  negative for erdheim chester  let me see   if its not erdheim chester  its exactly what we said before  garden variety viral gastroenteritis can we go back to the party  do a kidney biopsy  esthers shut down in exactly  chase this kid is not esther  you screwed up she died im sorry  but that does not mean this kid is dying as well  jeez  you get testy when you dont get any fuzz  come on  what did the test say  chase colonoscopy was clean  and the biopsy was negative for erdheim chester  alan so ians going to be all right it was just some sort of virus  whats that  urine  but its brown  ians kidneys are shutting down  still think its not the same case  house so what can cause bloody diarrhea ataxia and kidney failure   ill go do a biopsy  house forget it  that battles over  his rising creatinine is his kidneys way of saying go on without me  what explains everything  e coli ho157 causes bloody diarrhea and leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome  toxins from the bacteria cause his kidneys to shut down  we should start him on plasmaphoresis  clear concise and completely plausible  and exactly what i did last time didnt work   what else  good pastures syndrome  circulating antibodies cause kidney failure and bleeding  but not the purple papules  if you throw in esthers next symptom  brainmakes me think heavy metal toxicity  his hematocrit would have to be low its at 44 and   esthers never dropped below  42  you have the file memorized  its my lucky number  what about lymphoma  causes kidney failure gi bleed and can infiltrate the base of the brain  you check esther for that  she never showed any signs of  if he has lymphoma this far advanced we should be able to see it in his blood and brain  chase run a blood smear and immunochemistries foreman get an mri   ill page cuddy  no you wont  she thinks the kid has a stomach ache  shell come right up here and do one of two things  if she agrees with me i dont need her  if she disagrees i dont want her  cant handle people disagreeing with you  she might have a different take on this  subordinates can disagree with me all they want its healthy  people who can shut me down on the other hand  forget cuddy ill have wilson keep her busy    keep your answers short and discreet is cuddy still playing  the chicken is still in piccadilly square  brilliant  shell never suspect that normandy is our target  is that house  tell him that the blinds just went to 2040 and hes running out of chips  house hows she doing  well whats going on  the way you took off somethings obviously  love to chat but got a game to play  hows  she doing  the patient is on life support were about to pull the plug  are you talking about me  what have you got  mmm those sound like highdose cardio meds  two hearts  you got the flush  still waiting on the final labs  she drinking her seltzer  no hydration is not a problem  house means shes bluffing push her all in  call  two pair  show me your hearts  seven of clubs  oh dear sounds like i messed up  youre gonna be stuck with her for a while  talk to you soon   oh yes  why are you taking a picture of his head  were looking for lymphoma but  so its not erdheim something  and its not his kidneys but his kidneys are failing  w hat wheres dr cuddy  dr house mentioned another case  is there another patient with the same same thing that ian has   notexactly  what does that mean  dr house had a patient a while back who exhibited the same symptoms as your son  then you know whats wrong  no  so what do you know  we know the likely course the disease will take  alan which is   she had multiple system failures  what happened to her  she died 24 hours after her admission  mr or mrs alston would you mind giving me a hand  hes having trouble sitting still  its impossible to get the detail we need  so i figured he might feel more comfortable hearing your voices  ian honey  just sit still  youll be done in a moment were here with you  im scared  its okay honey its  its only a big camera its going to take a picture of your head  you love it when i take your picture at home dont you  yeah  and you have to hold still for that too right  but this isnt like that  i know its scary ian  but you can do it  youre getting to be so grown up  so  just  hold perfectly still just for a little bit  mommy are you crying  no no honey im just tired  okay ill try  the base of his brain has been infiltrated by a small mass   we think  pituitary  looks that way  explains the low blood pressure  pretty much confirms the lymphoma  if wed started esther on prednisone  uh did anyone see the lymphoma  cameron no we saw a mass the location was consistent with  didnt see any in the blood either  white blood cells show no spindling or abnormal nuclei  nothing on immunochemistries either its not lymphoma  foreman house  its a train  we dont know what kind of train   whoa whoa whoa  im thirsty  its closed  its not now  we got one advantage  we know where the tracks are going  the fact that the end of the line is death  is an advantage  the fact that we know is an advantage  means maybe we can get ahead of it  next station is the liver weve got about 90 minutes before it gets there  maybe we can cut down a tree across the line just outside of town  ill do an ultrasound  no treatment will tell us more faster  how can we start treatment if we have no idea what weretreating for   treat him for everything  give him acetylcysteine and interferon and silymarin  and whatever else you can think of to protect the liver    whats going on  oh just catching up on some tv  how are you doing  well thanks to your last consult  the patient has improved dramatically  tell house the patient is about to kill the doctor   she says the pa  i heard what dya got  well cuddy just raised and uh   youre paired  what  nines  how do you know  anything lower you wouldnt sound so excited  jacks or higher  your voice sounds like debbie from accounting is sitting in your lap  ask cuddy if she can beat a pair of threes  wait whatswhats going on  if youre going to mess with me wouldnt it be more fun to do it in person  yes it would  um can you beat a pair of threes  house what did she do  i left orders for po fluids doctor  enough with the codes she obviously knows its me  shes drinking her seltzer  did she stop   yes  go all in   umbut  just do it  you couldnt care less about this charity event  you claim not to be messing with me  obviously youre either trying to keep me  shut up  look last time i wanted the game to go on  i still do  that means that this time you get to win  hold on  i fold  ho ho ho  house are you sure youre okay  meds seem to be working livers holding its own  good  but the platelets are dropping  even better  why it means hes getting sicker  its new new is good  because old ended in death  i cant breathe  chase  what  whats happening  ian come on  honey just relax  ian breathe come on honey  breathe please honey    we had to put him on a ventilator  hes back on esthers path  and we managed to make the train skip a few stations  which means that instead of 12 hours hes probably got less than two  which begs the question why  what did we do  acetylcysteine could mess with the lungs  mess with them not shut them down in 20 minutes  interferon modulates the immune system  it could affect cancer of the blood like one of the leukemias  it doesnt speed them up it slows them down  it slows down all 500 of them  anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour  what effects would interferon have on leukemia  depends on what type could make it better could make it worse  fouryear fellowship to learn that  cuddy tell house if he wants to play cards he should get his ass back down here and play  you hear that  she wants me off the phone means shes vulnerable  go all in  but um the partys over in less than three hours  cuddy its over in less than two hours  which means you either have three of a kind or just 3s  im guessing 3s  i bet 500  go all in  you obviously want to bust me why would you  either you go all in or  i tell everybody in the building that you wear toenail polish  im all in  ill call  im betting you have a pair of threes but even if you have three  its not going to beat trip nines  oh oh oh no  oh no  oh oh thats gotta hurt  what happened  i just killed two birds with one straight  goodbye  fine keep playing  but i need you to recommend a good oncologist  because if i dont get one up here in the next few minutes i got a dead sixyearold  wilson if you need help ask  these games are insane  games have a higher success rate  well i dont see anything that looks like leukemia  you do a bone marrow biopsy  no time  even if there is an occult blood cancer  you wouldnt expect interferon to make it worse  certainly not this fast  what would move this fast  cameron autoimmune diseases  if his bodys own defenses are attacking him then beefing them up is just going to put fuel on the fire  sarcoidosis could be in his brain and lungs  no no enlarged hilar lymph nodes on his chest xray  the systemic nature suggests juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  or kawasakis disease  cant be kawasakis  doesnt affect the elderly  uh these this is a kids xray  house had another patient  who may or may not have had kawasakis  this kid on the other hand  he makes antibodies that are eating the inside of his arteries  choking off blood to his major organs one by one  first the gi tract then the kidneys then the brain now the lungs  can anyone think of a reason why kawasakis cant affect the elderly  other than that it doesnt  nice  foreman we can confirm with blood work  we need an ana sed rate  labs will take two hours  what was the old ladys sed rate  house elevated 98  you cant use another patients labs to diagnose kawasakis disease  is that like a dare or something  you dont have time to be wrong  fine  well look for kawasaki where he lives  ians coronary arteries  this other patient  the old lady esther  have you read moby dick  it was a book  it was 10 years ago  obsessionis dangerous  only if youre on a wooden ship and your obsession is a whale  i think im in the clear  you do realize its a metaphor  you do realize that the point of metaphors is to scare people from doing things by telling them that  something much scarier is going to happen than what will really happen  god i wish i had a metaphor to explain that better  go back to the game  dont worry im not going to get eaten by witches  chase coronary arteries clear no aneurysms  flip the mode lets see the flow  how did that other woman die  she went into respiratory distress  her heart and liver were already com  no  did she suffer  was she in pain  i dont know  laminar flow  no blood clots no ragged edges  cameron damn shut it down  were just wasting time  look at the right atrium  thats not kawasakis  no  chase its small but its there  esther didnt have a mass in her heart  ians younger  he can take more of a pounding  esther died before the disease reached her heart  the disease made a mass and made it fast  could be bacteria   muscle  connective tissue  hosue the kid cant take any more theories  only thing we know is that whatever that mass is thats what hes got  we need a piece of it  im doing a biopsy  ill shut the blinds  no let them watch  i do my best work on the big stage  passing through the superior vena cava  youre in the atrium pull back  you hit the wall of the heart  these procedures would be so much simpler if we could do them on healthy people  and out again     v fib  cardiac arrest call it  come on paddles   come on  charging  clear   code blue iso room  and again   nothing  again  have you got a clock on this  how much longer you going to be doing this  clear  wait got something  hes back  chase what are you doing  im doing what we came here to do   it almost killed him  i know i was right here  give me a vacutainer  his brains been oxygendeprived for over eight minutes  there might benothing left you might be  tell the parents where the hell is that vacutainer  so whats he got  brain damage  good chance i was talking about before that  youre not worried about  things i cant do anything about i try not to  things just roll off you like water off a duck  histiocytosis  very unlikely in a 73yearold  whatever this is is very unlikely  come on more ideas lets go people  genetic disorders could cause masses everywhere  tuberous sclerosis  if its genetic hes had it all his life why now  i dont know it sure fits nice enough  we havent ruled out leukemia yet  or sarcoma he could have multiple soft tissue tumors  foreman or sarcoidosis   multiple neurofibromatosis foreman chondrocytomas  hows it going you win  i got called away by the angry parents of a patient  there are three of you here none of you had the sense to stop him   to pick up a phoneand call me  house i told them youd signed off  the parents are mad because their kid is dying  its understandable  but if he doesnt die they wont be mad anymore  if hes braindamaged they might still be a little ticked   i had to do it to save him  you had to do it to diagnose esther  you may have killed a sixyearold  because youre obsessed with a woman whos been dead for 12 years  sometimes you lose house youre not god  hes not dead yet  no but youre done with him its my case now go home  go ride your motorcycle go brood in a dark room  just dont go near ian again  so anything else or is it just these seven  drop it house shes right  no shes not   you know shes not  we should have called her  im surprised you didnt  youre going to have to find a way to let this gowe cant go near ian  we dont need to go near him  we have his tumor  cuddy may be right that we screwed up the protocol  she may be right about my screwedup obsession  but i am right about the medicine  how many tests can we do with that    look we cure the kid we solve everybodys problems  how many   maybe two good pieces  how many okay pieces  three would be pushing it  three tests seven choices  okay whats first  uhsarcoidosis seems most likely  yeah so likely that cuddys going to think of that all on her own  shes got the kids whole body to play with  let her do that test whats next  its moving too fast to be spreading  it has to be growing from something thats already  genetic disorder tuberous sclerosis  or its his immune system histiocytosis  there are more documented cases of histio amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis  lets start with that  wing or drumstick  gonna need a little more than that  a little more is more than a third  if we have to repeat this test because you didnt cut us enough  chase im adding one microliter of the immunoperoxidase  make it two  i dont want house biting off our heads because we werent sure if it turned red or not  cameron thats definitely not red  the problem could still be an abnormal cell growth but a different cell line  foreman sarcoma muscle cells are throughout his body  would explain the geography  cameron genetic disorder is far more likely in a sixyearold  tuberous sclerosis  pretty unlikely to cause a gi bleed  the time course fits  so foreman you agree with both of them thanks for playing  if we have enough tissue for two tests why not do both  then we dont have to think as hard  taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically  sarcoma is more likely to hita 6 and a 70yearold  tuberous sclerosis it is  you think sarcoma is less likely  its more likely  the test for it on the other hand is less reliable  cameron nestins negative  well thats okay  if the tumor cells havent matured the ki67 protein wouldnt have turned off  what happens if we dont solve this   the kid dies  i mean for the next 12 years  ki67s negative  and pch antigen is negative  mighty caseys down to his last strike  mighty casey struck out  thanks a lot i was going to read that this weekend  cameron chondrocytoma  connective tissue has been in all the places weve been looking  the kid is too sick for that were better off testing for sarcoma  we would have seen signs of that when we tested for tuberous sclerosis  tumor cells look like muscle under the microscope  no they didnt they looked like fat  i vote for neurofibromatosis  why  because the other choices suck worse  give me a minute  you want me out of here  you come up with anything  no  hey  we can talk about it tomorrow  i um  i won the poker tournament  i totally played this guy berman from business affairs  i got great cards but i dont bet just call no raises  berman pairs his king on the flop  i keep calling the river turns i check  he cant stand it he goes all in hes sure hes won  i call i flip em pow  pocket aces  i nailed his ass  the aces were hiding all along  test him for erdheim chester disease  erdheim chester thats not even on the list  because we already did it  he tested negative  so did esther  the disease lied  yeah the tumors got it in for you diseases dont lie  fine it didnt lie it slow played us  we biopsied the colon but it hadnt reached the gi tract yet  its there now  its in his liver his lungs  you want it to be there  because then you didnt screw up 12 years ago  we cant waste our one test on the one disease we know its not  run the test  you sure about this  wait let me think about that  dont pressure me  just run the damn test  cameron cells look like macrophages  thats a good start  take your time and say it loud  cd 68 positive  start the treatment  so esther can rest peaceful now huh  yeah   you got lucky  you gonna call  what i do  is not just based on the flip of a card  you guessed you got lucky  it fit  it could just as easily have been sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis  no not just as easily  maybe not but it wasnt impossible  are you going to call  you know  relative to its size  the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal
