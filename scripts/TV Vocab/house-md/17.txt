                  and the only thing wrong  the only thing wrong with the american dream  is people too many people  too many of us telling young people that the dream is dead  they told me that when i was growing up in the slums oftrenton   and they were wrong  they told me that when i decided to run for senator with only 58 in my savings account  and they were wrong  and they are still telling me that now that i dont have a chance because im black  because i dont have the right nose because i still only have 58 in my savings account    with your help we can keep that dream alive  and in closing  just  let me say  let me say that you should all donate the legal maximum  to the next president of the united states  are you okay do you need some water or something no im fine im fine really  handsome guy like you i bet you get 70 of the women  well heres hoping  of course it helps your wife died of cancer  i mean im sorry but the sympathy votes in your pocket  yeah i appreciate your support   listen senator my union has a hell of a war chest  um ive always been strong on the union  the thing is you always go on in your speeches about the workers  in indonesia cambodia timbuktu  because i think we have a a moral  my union members are hurting  they dont care about moral this and moral that are you all right   senator  ugh hey  the guys are gonna love that   everyone give him some room give him room to breathe  back off please senator are you all right   the senators suffering from nausea headache and mental confusion  ah bad sushi is so hard to diagnose  youre being childish  look ifhis case is as trivial as you think itll take you three minutes to diagnose  uhhuh three minutes that i could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages   youre mad at me  nope  i never liked cameron or foreman  you know why im forcing you to fire one of them because you need to prove to me that youre a team player  now if you did that you wouldnt need to go through this exercise  fine ill hold the senators hair while he upchucks  oh and uh by the way  i need you to give a speech at the national cardiology conference um next week  i dont do speeches im shy  eastbrook pharmaceuticals has developed a new ace inhibitor  i would like you to extol the virtues of this breakthrough medication  eastbrook pharmaceuticals  wait a second dont i own that company  oh no thats right you do  viopril is a significant improvement over the old version  its all there in the study  i know its price tag is significantly improved   you can either give one 10minute talk and one threeminute diagnosis  or you can fire one of your pets  my understanding was that you believed in rationality above all else  viopril   i appreciate your keeping the media away  were keeping your staff away as well take it easy now   im in the middle of a campaign  the faster we can get you better the faster you can get out of here  anyone else at the fundraiser get sick  i dont think so and i dont think thats it ive been under the weather for weeks  lots of traveling im supposed to be in the sudan next week     oh  helps me concentrate     even better than drugs  open your mouth please  ahh  thats quite a scar  when i was six i fell off the swing and bit my tongue  couldnt talk right for the longest time   lots of teasing it just made me fight harder speak up for those who cant  yeah yeah yeah  tongues heal too fast your political consultants have written you a nice story  in a tight race the lispers alone could put you over the top  you a republican or you just hate all politicians  i just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying  you find sincerity annoying  youre a black kid from the ghetto  who made it to yale law and the united states senate  thats a sufficiently mythical story you dont need to lie about your tongue  mustve missed it  whats wrong  what is it its not the food its your brain  get an mri and a lumbar puncture  cancel your travel plans  the senators lp showed no sign of infection and the mri looks fairly clean  i guess we can tell him hes fairly healthy and can go home  well there is something in brocas area  but its small low intensity  most likely just background noise care to bet your job on that  what was that what was what  you got annoyed that was clearly an annoyed face  i get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures  last week you didnt get annoyed you made poopie in your pants its weird  its almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about  chase has nothing to worry about  none of you has anything to worry about  what happened  vogler saw the error of his ways and repented  the lesion could be nothing also could be a brain tumor or an infection  theres only one way to find out which  you want to cut into his brain  dangerous i know especially since hes a politician his brains all twisted  but i weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch call surgery get it scheduled   youre not pregnant  well i told you that  theres got to be some other reason im still spotting  sure you were pregnant  based on your hormone levels youve had a miscarriage  i havent even been on a date  right and since its physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner  i havent had sex since i split up with my husband   that was almost a year ago  fine have it your way  immaculate conception   um what do i do  well its obvious  start a religion  in my office  afternoon delight she just loves the hard wood  youre not doing a brain biopsy based on a spot on an mri   whered you get that  not on a united states senator  oh just so im clear if he was a janitor that would be okay do you have a list  a brain biopsy can cause permanent neurological damage  uhhuh whereas tumors are really good for brains make em grow big and strong   its my call  no its not   youre pulling rank on patient care  its not my call either   its up to you  either its a tumor or its an infection that the lumbar puncture didnt pick up  either way unless we treat it immediately it could kill you  or it could be nothing reading brain mris is not an exact science  well what caused my ssymptoms  wow excellent question many doctors wouldnt have gone there  it could be a transient ischemic attack  you could make the argument for watching carefully for the time being  hmm but youd only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your ass  thats absurd and insulting insulting yes  what would the voters think  if they find out ive had a bbrain biopsy  this could leave you bbbbrain damaged  and youre worried about nascar dads    its not a brain tumor  its not a bacterial infection either  so you biopsied his brain for nothing  if that were true would dr wilsons mouth be contorted into that ugly shape  its toxoplasmosis  you sure  which means the great black hope has fullblown al ds  theyre gonna love that in dubuque  toxoplasmosis is a fairly common fungus you can get  from eating undercooked meat or touching cat feces  in rare cases the fungi travel up the bloodstream and latch onto the brain  causing a lesion or inflammation  so whats the prognosis  toxo usually responds to treatment  but it only causes a lesion in your brain if your immune system is extremely weak to begin with  senator im afraid you have al ds     as im sure  no as im sure you know people with hiv can live a long time   what else could do this to me  theoretically certain cancers  if you have toxo in your brain you have aids  i do not have al ds  i dont sh sh shoot up drugs  i dont ssleep with  this is very bad news i get that and i sympathize  but we gotta speed through the denial phase because you need antiretrovirals and you need them fast  butyou havent even tested me for hiv   we will  but the toxo drugs are gonna piss off your fungi  and when fungi get pissed     i am not going to take the pills  youre afraid word will leak out  trust me youre not gonna be president either way  they dont call it the white house because of the paint job  heres what youre gonna do  youre gonna give me the drugs for the toxo only  youre going to test me for hiv under a false name  you are going to test me for cancer  and anything else that could have done this to me  if i have cancer i will deal with it  but i do not  have al ds  eastbrook pharmaceuticals are pleased to announce  that dr gregory house will present the latest research on our exciting new ace inhibitor   youre making that up thats voglers company  press release during an address at the north american cardiology conference   house never gives speeches  but when i really believe in something  gosh dang it i got a chance to make a difference here  you made a deal with vogler  its all the rage everybodys doing it  so whats the deal you get to keep all of us if you flog his products  one speech no biggie  foremans doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer  cancer the senators got al ds  cancer sounds better in a press release  i need you guys to rush the elisa test for hiv  thank you  for the speech  when i said rush i meant you know fast   stats the word you doctors use right  i know its hard for you  double stat   this may sting a little  sorry  it wasnt the shot  its um my heads killing me  senator we dont have to do this now  we can hold off till your hiv test comes back   because you figure its gonna come back positive  in my experience patients lie  politicians lie more black politicians  oh i dont think black politicians lie more than white politicians   we lie less  you figure were morally superior   ive got my theories  no we we just cant get away with it    no ones gonna ggive us the benefit of the doubt  no ones gonna cut us a second chance  and when it happens its not just a a bad politician  its its a bad role model  its a a dis  discredit to the race  you ready yeah  yeah  take a deep breath     dr house i just wanted  youre welcome again i want you to know how much  got it youre grateful  apparently you seem to think it will mean a lot to me to know that  do you know why people pray to god  i thought you didnt believe in god i dont  well then you better be making a very good point  do you think they pray to him and praise him because they want him to know how great he is  god already knows that  are you comparing me to god  i mean thats great but just so you know ive never made a tree  i thank you because it means something to me  to be grateful for what i receive  you are the most naive atheist ive ever met  dr house you have a patient in room one  thank god  people pray so that god wont crush them like bugs  im not gonna crush you  petechial bruising i dont know if i pronounced that right  gosh the internet is such a wonderful tool  it could be leukemia definitely possible  the more likely diagnosis is hickey  well it cant be a hickey  why is everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden  im not having sex  ive barely even thought about sex since my marriage ow  i say youre having sex you say youre not  either youre lying or im wrong   or theres some middle ground  you mean like oral  i mean youre having sex without knowing it  im testing you for booze drugs and ghb  i dont drink orwhats ghb  the daterape drug  its positive  your t cell count is eight  which means theres a good chance youll die  im telling you this because we need to contact your sexual partners  ive only had two girlfriends  two after my wife died  i used ccondoms  you know the chances of you getting hi v from heterosexual sex with a condom  yes  someday there will be a black president  someday there will be a gay president  maybe therell even be a gay black president  but one combination i do not see happening is gay black and dead  you need to stop lying to me  it must be miserable always assuming the worst in people  cut the crap youre dying  and youre clever youre witty and you are a coward  youre scared of taking chances   i take chances all the time its one of my worst qualities  on people  wanting to believe the best about people doesnt make it true  being afraid to believe it doesnt make it false  well thats very moving its a shame i dont vote hmm  this is who i am i believe in people  im not hiply cynical and i dont make easy snide remarks  i would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again  i need to draw some more blood  nurse  the antiretrovirals arent working  thats not surprising  hes just gonna keep getting worse you realize that right  why are you spying on my case  why are you giving that speech next week  were both just doing what we have to do you dont see a problem with that  checking in on a patient  yeah wow how do i look myself in the mirror  youre not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the american people  its a 10minute speech that ive been ordered to give  voglers drug works dont care  why do you have to make everything so dramatic im a very highstrung little lap dog        uhuh no pills  whats going on  the antiretrovirals arent working  why not  because you dont have al ds  the first test was a false positive  happens one time in every 5000  you rran a second test   yeah  yeah  youre still dying  the only difference is now we dont know why  hes continuing to lose control of the muscles on his right side   his brain is getting foggier and his t cells are still in single digits  why are we doing this here  so cuddy cant find us  unless we figure out the underlying disease this guys lied to his last constituent   false negative on the pcr al ds test  ran it twice   immunoglobulin deficiency  no history of respiratory problems  idiopathic t cell deficiency  idiopathic from the latin meaning were idiots cause we cant figure out whats causing it   give him a whole body scan   you hate whole body scans  cause theyre useless  could probably scan any one of us and find five different doodads that look like cancer  but when youre fourth down and a hundred to go in the snow  you dont call a running play up the middle unless youre thejets  i hate sports metaphors  why did you order the second aids test  standard procedure oh well thats you mr standard procedure  you suspected the first test was a false positive  i knew he was going to africa and i figured he was vaccinated for hep a and b  that could cause a false positive   you knew that before you ordered the first test what changed  i should have ordered both  you were sure he had al ds  then you talked to him then you had doubts what did he say  he said he had not engaged in any risky behavior  huh and you believed him  he didnt have any reason to lie  everybody lies except politicians  house i believe youre a romantic  you didnt just believe him you believed in him  do you want to come over tonight and watch old movies and cry  dr camerons getting to you  well i guess you cant be around that much niceness and not get any on you  is that why you havent put the moves on her  what makes you think i havent put the moves on her  oh oh boy youre in trouble    you have restored my faith in the human race   youre lying  no im not lying  just got your results back no ghb no nothing  it means youre having sex and youre lying about it  no and i have a new symptom  i have a rash on my butt   do you wanna yeah   what is it  its a carpet burn  no it cant be  doctor i love sex  i miss it i havent had any in over a year  well you managed to keep this appointment so you have no shortterm memory problem  multiple personalities do you find yourself losing chunks of time  do you wake up and you dont remember falling asleep no i just wake up really exhausted   something upsetting you  no  my ex lives in the apartment downstairs  hes always calling me always wanting to get back together complaining about mixed signals  get out of my life  how much clearer can you get  we have a sleep lab in the basement  if nothing else it will get you away from your ex for a night  slightly enlarged lymph node in his left armpit  how slightly quarter mil   lymphoma   sure  or hes had a cold in the last six months   what you got her on speed dial  i just follow the scent of arrogance  another slightly enlarged node over here two more in his neck and one in his groin   and theres a cyst in his liver   it looks complex central necrosis   spontaneous bleeding its benign  i was rooting for a really cool tumor instead were stuck with this crap  doesnt matter once you find em you gotta check em  knock yourselves out  i just saw senator wright he looks like hell  that sushi mustve been a lot worse than you thought  mr vogler would you like a free whole body scan  a man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year  heres a few key points i want you to cover during your speech   fourteen pages  the audience will be comatose by paragraph two  throw in a joke  dr chase we need to talk   how do you see this ending  what ending  i cant fire you so you have no reason to fear me and therefore no reason to lie to me  you told cuddy where i was you told vogler what i was doing  yeah so how can i work with you  well you dont have a choice   this might hurt a little   lie to me    okay itll feel like a gentle massage  house  is a lousy teacher  you cant lie for beans  have you ever told any really big ones  ohhohoho  i might be messed up but im not that out of it      strap his arm down  am i going to be okay  i hope so  i am selling my soul  just a little piece and you are getting something in return  i said i was selling it didnt say i was giving it away  that would be immoral and stupid  all theyve done is add an antacid  does it work thats not the point  of course its the point hes not asking you to lie  hes not asking you to do something illegal hes not asking me to do anything  hes not ordering you he gave you a choice you chose your staff  i know this isnt easy for you youll suffer  vicodin sales in jersey will triple  but you are doing a good thing  only you could feel like crap about doing something good  kidney and liver cysts are both benign and the lymph nodes all came back clean   his left armpit node has antibodies for cd 11  not enough to indicate lymphoma  we never tested for hairy cell leukemia  no but we would have picked it up somewhere else besides one lymph node   and his spleen isnt enlarged  size isnt everything  the spleen is the mother lode for hairy cells   lets cut it open  you cant biopsy his spleen itll bleed like stink  in the senators condition a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him  why do you do this to me  now if i kill him i cant tell the judge i had no idea of the risks involved  his brain is turning into mush and hes at risk for more infections we have to do it  see thatll sound much better in court  okay go tell our human pincushion well be sticking him one more time  cuddy  dont you hate doing this  yeah  whats up  you like me  why  thats kind of a sad question  im just trying to figure out what makes you tick  i am not warm and fuzzy and you are basically a stuffed animal made by grandma  i dont think thats why youre asking   i think this is because of the speech  god dont try and pick me apart  then why are you asking  what do you want to hear     hey senator we need to do one more biopsy on your spleen   ill have to sign lefty  my fingers arent working    have you been coughing a lot   does it hurt  its like i cant get air  is that from the toxo  no this isthis is new  you dont need to sign we cant do the biopsy    the senators breathing is severely impaired  his o2 sat levels are at 89  his silver stain indicates pneumocystis carinii pneumonia  another killer fungus its consistent with hairy cell leukemia   but we cant biopsy his spleen respiratory distress  his platelets are 20 and dropping his blood wont clot worth a damn   theres gotta be another way to diagnose hairy cell  no his bone marrows indeterminate spleen biopsys the only way to go  you know when the inuit go fishing they dont look for fish  why dr house  they look for the blue heron because theres no way to see the fish  but if theres fish theres gonna be birds fishing  now if hes got hairy cell what else should we see circling overhead   he should have all sorts of weird viruses  htlv and atlv  we can test for them run the titers  these were your brain waves at 245 am  now here it comes theres an abruptjump from slowwave sleep  this indicates partial sleep arousal  most common type is somnambulism sleepwalking  that would explain why im so tired when i wake up  yes and also why you were pregnant  and the hickeys and the carpet burn  i had sex in my sleep  sexsomnia is a documented disorder  you said your ex lives downstairs ill kill him  okay but he probably didnt know that you were asleep  sexsomniacs can act pretty normal  im gonna write you a prescription for a lowdose antidepressant  itll let you sleep better  if you wanna save yourself the 15 copay you could have sex while youre awake   hes my ex i dont  you live in the same building  you havent had sex with anyone else for a year you sleepwalk right into his arms  call me crazy but im sensing unresolved issues  negative for htlv 1 and 2  and negative for atlv and everything else  its not hairy cell  hey you really gonna give that speech  you got an opinion too im a little surprised  frankly i thought you were too much of a selfabsorbed ass to do this for us  youre welcome hes positive for epsteinbarr  so what  it doesnt point to hairy cell its irrelevant   hey  you didnt fall off the swings when you were eight   sssix  ever  give that back uhuh we have to talk  you had an epileptic seizure  thats how you bit your tongue  li havent had a seizure since  what medication did you take  no ssseizure since i was six  no drdrdrugs ssince i was 10  yeah thats it dont worry about what the question is  dont worry that youre starting to feel dizzy just stay on message    my   my mother used to call it   funnysomething   phenytoin  yes  okay okay youre okay  its okay   everybody lies   senator gary h wright of newjersey had childhood epilepsy  he took phenytoin  that drug with the epsteinbarr virus  is associated with common variable immunodeficiency disease  t cells down b cells down keeps you from forming enough antibodies  see the antibodies are basically your defensive line  and your brain is like the quarterback  and then the fungi are like blitzing linebackers plunging up the middle  your lungs are like  okay you got two quarterbacks  c vid  thats a type of immunoglobulin deficiency i said that  yeah well it was a stupid idea when you said it  then he got the respiratory problem and he tested positive for epsteinbarr  thats pretty much a childhood disease  thats another reason why chases suggestion was idiotic he got it when he was a kid  he didnt get any symptoms until now it happens  it gets triggered by stress like public speaking  so youre basing your diagnosis on a virus thats relatively common and a drug he took 30 years ago  start the senator on iv immunoglobulin stat  lfhe gets better im right lfhe dies youre right  dr house  you faked that no  say antiretroviral antiretroviral  now say it three times fast  we just got your latest blood results your white cells are up  your t cells are back over a hundred thatsthats good right  in a week thats terrific  youll need medication for the rest of your life but other than that youre fine  am i well enough to run for president   why not run for pope while youre at it  oh come on  kennedy had addisons fdr had polio two of the best presidents in the last hundred years  if they were running today they wouldnt stand a chance   you figure youd be surgeon general if you didnt have the limp  no theres things i cant do  and like you said i have to live with reality  well then im running  good for you  now dont get excited hes right i uh i wont win  then why run  oh i see your point being the only way to make a difference is to win every fight  but hey why listen to me  i own the company im certainly not to be trusted right    dr greg house on the other hand has a reputation  for integrity among other things    ladies and gentlemen dr greg house    eastbrook pharmaceuticals extraordinary commitment to research excellence  is exemplified by their new ace inhibitor  a breakthrough medical approach that will protect millions from heart disease  thats not a speech  i thought it was pithy  you got enough for a press release anyhow foreman or cameron    a few things i forgot to mention  ed vogler is a brilliant businessman  a brilliant judge of people  and a man who has never lost a fight  you know how i know that the new ace inhibitor is good  cause the old one was good the new one is really the same just more expensive  a lot more expensive  you see thats another example of eds brilliance  whenever one ofhis drugs is about to lose its patent  he has his boys and girls alter itjust a tiny bit patent it all over again  making not just a pointless new pill  but millions and millions of dollars  which is good for everybody right  except the patients but  who cares  theyre just so damn sick  god obviously never liked them anyway  all the healthy people in the room lets have a big round of applause for ed vogler    i threw in a joke       im sorry  i shouldve taken an extra couple of vicodin and just held my nose   im guessing you did take a couple extra vicodin  true  you dont need to worry about firing anyone im leaving  why  is this another noble selfsacrificing gesture  are you trying to protect foreman no  so this is just dont fire me i quit  im protecting myself  you asked me why i like you  youre abrasive and rude  but i figured everything you do you do it to help people  but i was wrong  you do it because its right  there are only two ways that i can deal with things  one is in my control  thats to leave  goodbye house  thats some bad hat harry
