sick  joey  let me go somethings wrong with him  youre not getting out of this that easy joey  either youre dead or youre testifying   dont have it   budget nope  revenue statement list of expenses  house has been very busy  saving new jersey from leprosy yes i know  getting me his numbers thats your job   were in a meeting  i need the lawyer  whod you kill nobody but its not even lunch  i got served with a federal court order some witness went into a coma  they want me to take a look at him  what  they want you to examine a sick person  this is a public relations nightmare  folk think our staff do that kind of thing around here  this place will be crawling with sick people  im a doctor im not a lapdog for the feds i dont play fetch  nobody tells you what to do am i right dr cuddy  you have three choices hire a lawyer to fight the order treat the guy or go to jail for contempt  up to you  jail youd like that no more naughty schoolgirl  conjugal visit thats her new fantasy   were not leaving until hes gone or you show me  one good reason for keeping him    hes really out of it huh  causes of coma metabolic structural he had his stomach pumped  why would they do that rule out poisoning  huh not the typical first guess  nope first guess was faking it the patients a federal witness reluctant im assuming  hes also an eight on the glasgow coma scale   hes barely alive pretty tough to fake  any recent history of head trauma bad car accident fall  they tell me no but do an mri to be sure   metabolic causes liver kidney diabetes  check for everything feds are paying  were gonna turn a profit on this one boys  dr house bill arnello im a lawyer  i represent mr smith whats wrong with him  do i come to you with my problems  hes also my brother  what you changed your name  smith wasnt good enough for you  his names joey hes my only brother hes important to you  got it so no placebos for him well use the real medicine   this was fun lets do it again soon  brother in the mafia  so justjoey  i was hoping for a nickname  joey mango joey the wrench     people know where i am i want you to do your job  diagnose him fix him and keep him here  were a bit of a specialized hospital we generally only deal with patients while theyre actually sick  if you release my brother to the government  and he does what they want even if you fix him hes dead  i need time to convince him of that    good news is if you screw up  you dont have to worry about a malpractice suit  instead one by one  ill take away the things you love till theres nothing left    so on the mafia thing  thats a yes     did house seem weird to you  were you expecting him to be weird  we spoke  about how we felt  you told him you liked him no of course not  whwhat are you talking about then i asked him if he liked me  why would you do that because   i like him  you like him like him  doesnt matter he doesnt like me  hey he doesnt like anybody  and nobody likes him  mri showed a subdural hematoma  bleeding around his brain caused pressure inside his head which caused the coma  these look like pseudomembranes  those take time to form  if its an old injury it wouldnt cause the coma  patient history indicates he was hit with a tire iron in 1996  brother says he was changing a tire and it slipped  an old hematoma placed where this one is could have caused his coma   what about his liver  lfts are slightly elevated  key word is slightly as in not high enough to cause the coma  its the subdural i say we evacuate the cavity see if he wakes up  the neurologist thinks its his brain and wants to open up his head frankly im shocked  and you get to use the big boydrill in daddys big red toolbox   no drilling   hi  mr smith  call mejoe can you not do that  so were clear about the no drilling   hes okay now he can leave  im not releasing him cause the brother doesnt want you to  or because he had an unexplained coma which sounds better  the hematoma caused the coma thats a catchy diagnosis you could dance to that   i think chase is right  it still should be evacuated but its not an immediate threat  camerons my girl  id release him   are you disagreeing with me because  im disagreeing because thats my medical opinion  of course it is  but unless ive been named as the fourth part of the axis of evil  invaded and occupied this is still not a democracy  hes staying send for hepatitis serologies and an autoimmune panel    hey im with you  old enough to drink old enough to do something really stupid and make yourself a baby  hes my brother im watching him while our parents are in barbados  hes having trouble breathing and theres a lot of wheezing  whistling technically upper airways nose  if hes got the croup that that could become meningitis right absolutely  l i was just studying and all of a sudden i hear him crying and sounding all weird  oh mmy parents are gonna kill me  i doubt it you dont know them  no i doubt you were studying while your parents were away    hello officer  you might wanna rinse this off before you let him play with it again    what happened where is he  vogler called admitting admitting called justice justice came and took him away  and who called vogler  he loses money  so does ophthalmology who cares this is a hospital   you cant just cut a department  you cant control him  i am the only one that can control him   dddr house in the house   impeccable timing as always  you had no authority to release my patient  my colleague has just informed me she has a singular talent  you are just in time for a demonstration  dr house from what i understand  your patient from what you understand hes not your patient  how the hell do you understand anything its sad   youre not even a doctor  john smith is here only because of a court order  i had the records faxed to the judge she rescinded the order   why bother just to piss me off  keeping the government off our ass   hmm yeah   that makes no sense for a public institution  okay   okay what  okay sir  carry on  he really cares about his patients  yeah and he just walked out of here with nothin somethings up  just started vomiting and passed out   more lidocaine 590 with epi   thirtyfiveyearold male vital signs are stable now gave him two liters en route  he was just released from here two hours ago  you said he was good to go  watch that line  hes still not responding  so the junior gman badge isnt looking so good    his livers worse  comatose   no completely different symptoms than the first time  his serology tests came back positive for hepatitis c  hep c is a chronic condition you dont think this is an acute situation  coma vomiting abdominal pain hep c explains everything   except for the suddenness of the onset  whats wrong with the timing  you get home one night your wife hits you with a baseball bat  likely causes the fact that you havent thanked her for dinner in eight years  or the receipt for fur handcuffs that she found in your pants  sudden onset equals approximate cause  he also has high estrogen levels in his blood thats indicative of a chronic condition not acute  one test what do his other liver tests tell us  normal albumen levels point toward acute  oh okay and uh why is her test better than mine  because shes cuter though its close  do a liver biopsy when the results come back well know what were looking at  why wait to treat the hep c if im right joey gets better that much faster  right then he gets to testify and you get a gold star from cuddy  and whats the downside or is that the downside  do i have a reason for not wanting you to get any stars  fine start the treatment  its all your idea dont even mention my name  theres nothing wrong with your theory go  but in the humor me department get a biopsy while youre at it  foreman we need to talk   youre off the case  what   why  somebody told vogler that i lied to the transplant committee   you think i did  youre too careful  you wouldnt jump ship unless you knew what was in the water stop youre embarrassing me  but i want vogler to think i think its you  and i want cameron and chase cuddy and wilson the nursing staff  and the cashier in the parking lot to think that too  right  the blood tests show you have hepatitis c  its a virus that infects the liver  no way its not all bad news  it can often be cured and even if not its manageable  howd my brother get this it usually involves the exchange of bodily fluids either  bodily fluids what are you talkin about  there are many ways the virus can be transmitted sharing needles blood transfusions  hey nobody talks to my brother like this okay  fine no idea how he got it  but he has hepatitis c were gonna start him on  he doesnt have it dont mention it again dont treat him for it  house has some directed donations  foundation support  its around here  he makes you miserable  eight years hes worked here never made a dime for you  never listened to you he can change hes  he hasnt changed in eight years  either he cant change or you cant change him  you have no idea how many times hes lied to you undercut your authority  made you look like crap to other doctors  yes i hate him and here i am desperately trying to protect his job   what does that tell you  that you dont hate him  i do not protect people i like  i protect people who are assets to this hospital  no thats me  you   youre softer  right  there are three female chiefs of medicine  at major hospitals in this country  and we all got there using our feminine wiles   its human nature to want to protect people we like  i dont like him  to think if wejust form the right team well all get along and be able to pull the boat   i dont get along with him  this is not a team  its not a boat its not a machine that has a lot of parts that have to work together  the metaphors are all crap this is a business thats all it is  you like him thats bad for business    oh this is all my fault  took another homework break with betty lou  no last week i showed him a magic trick  you pulled a quarter out of his nose its a classic  yeah and now he wont stop shovin stuff up there   dr house  got a crisis here  its okay     stop  thats a neat trick  they have to believe youll actually hurt them  ah  your people insulted my brother  what they put romano in the parmesan cheese shaker again  said he was a crackhead or a homo or somethin   those idiots  how many times am i gonna have to send them for sensitivity training  nobodys saying hes a homo that would be really really bad  so lets put a nice friendly spin on it  lets go with he got raped in prison  i saw thejailhouse tats  put it together with the blood tests  there were rumors butjoey never said anything about it  if people find out hes bein treated for hep c  feds get that chart someone says somethin to somebody word will get out  and then joeys manhood his rep hes destroyed  youre worried about how his coworkers will react at the walmart in des moines  hes not going into witness protection im not gonna let that happen  listen i dont know if you know about this  but mob businesses sometimes keep two sets of books   one legit one not  exactly  you jerkin my chain  doctors are busy sometimes they forget to write things down happens all the time  thanks  oh and uh  whatever youre not giving him for whatever he doesnt have  is that gonna fix him  i doubt it  on your way to polish voglers car  gone are the days of the grumpy old doc  seeing patients in the basement of his house getting paid a few chickens   how will i eat  you know what cuddys been locked away with vogler about  all day today and yesterday  floor polish costs through the roof  you her secretarys been at the photocopier all day with your records  thats all theyre looking at in there my cars been stolen  or reincarnated  pink slip  a gift from the arnello brothers  you know theyre gangsters sure  but theyre thoughtful too  you cant keep it its graft  no no no no uhuh  graft is if i tell him ill only make him better if he slips me a couple bucks  or a payoff for something im not supposed to do  if id asked for the payoff which i didnt  i wouldve done the bad thing anyway  so theres nothing wrong with this  right damn  sixtyfive  perfectly restored  what do you think a guy likejoey would do if someone turned down a gift  thats kind of an insult isnt it  he might hurt you its definitely possible  im screwed gotta take the car   did you see houses new car  from joey he obviously cant keep it  you dont mind the hospital taking money from vogler  thats different voglers legit   thats worse voglers money came with strings  vogler doesnt set me up to have a mobster take a swing at me   im sure house didnt know  joeys pressure dropped  pushed iv fluids now hes holding a hundred systolic  septic no it looks like hes bleeding into his liver  varices see it with chronic hep c all the time  biopsys back  two findings number one  lymphocytic infiltrate and no bridging fibrosis  whatevers killing hims not hep c its acute  who said that i forget  what are you doing here i told you you were off the case   right your diabolic plan to convince the evil genius hes in the clear  so hell let his guard down and make a fatal mistake  sure well its clearly not gonna work now  what evil genius  if we knew that we wouldnt need a diabolic plan would we   house thinks someone ratted him out to vogler   what one of us  no you guys love me too much  look if its not the hep c then whats the problem whats causing the liver failure  finding number two toxins  no hes only 30 years old and his job doesnt expose him to heavy metals or environmental  hes a 30yearold mobster  he doesnt have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins  he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins  someones poisoned him   whatever this toxin is its doing thejob and fast  how long till we have the next round of test results   about four hours  too bad his livers only gonna last another two   were gonna have to get him a new one  what in two hours  there is another way  relax its kosher     this is so bizarre   not really we just take joeys blood out of his body  and run it through a pig  the pigs liver does whatjoeys cant it cleans the blood  which we send right back to him   and the pig makes him better   nope just buys us some time to figure out whats poisoning your brother  like nothin like you do this all the time  oh weve basically got a barn in the basement   cross offhemlock   you thought he was being poisoned by hemlock  dr euripides tell you to check for that  it grows wild by the highways out here  so how much do you like house   chase has a big mouth  yeah hes probably the one who ratted to vogler   i dont think that he would  does it hurt when youre with house  little pain in the tummy but it sort of feels good too   i dont have the right to show interest in someone  you absolutely do  and i absolutely have the right to humiliate you for it  anything  white blood counts low probably a result of the illness nothing to connect to the liver  is he a smoker  let me check  early signs of emphysema hes been smoking at least a dozen years   eighteen you got that from the white count  nope got that from the chest xray  white count just tells me hes quitting  two weeks ago  hows your tummy  flat and taut   ive been on thejob for 12 years  you put 3000 in your wifes checking account this morning i wanna know where it came from  i got a perfect record where did you get the money  cancel the thumbscrews ive got our culprit  who not who hu   huh  thanks for playing along  chai hu chinese herb in his quit smoking candy  reduces cravings also reduces his white blood count  oh yeah he also took enough of them to poison himself  well keep him on the pig for a few more hours and then take him off the candy  hell be fine  pig wont be oh no   hey  hey feelinbetter  im famished  i think they got fish sticks on the menu  ah yeah makes me miss prison  so the mobsters good to go  ill keep him overnight then let the feds know  hes good to rat out whoever he wants   brother wont be happy  maybe i have to give back the car  you should let vogler tell the feds why  because it matters to him  because you humiliated him the first timejoey was released   you think you should still be in third there ace  he humiliated himself  and because your job depends on the kind of mood voglers in at the end of his marathon with cuddy  seriously man have you ever actually driven an automobile before there are four gears you know  the 66 came with a shut up button        i have a problem with the tests  i need to know  it is my medical opinion that the patient is healthy and can be released  thanks for letting us know  get me the us attorneys office  i see you found out what were meeting about youre having a meeting  well whatever the reason the coat looks good on you  chai hu lozenges cause this kind of liver failure no way  not by themselves but in combination with the interferon its like gas to a flame   what interferon  for the hep c   what hep c  oops  is hiding a mobsters hep c that important   is letting the feds know everything that important  you are a piece of work even now knowing ed  edward  joeys back in a coma   hes stable but comatose   worse than before hes on a ventilator  question is why  its not his brain its not a toxin  our friend babe helped with that one   so what else  hep c  we never really treated it we stopped the interferon when it started poisoning his liver  am i gonna have to write a song about it his chronic hep c  was not bad enough to produce these symptoms   the estrogen level indicates it is  it indicates something else entirely  we cant give him interferon now there are still traces of the lozenges in his system  itll just poison him again  genetics  we dont treat the virus we change it  a nonnucleoside allosteric inhibitor  its never been tried on a human being it could kill him    whats the difference hes dead without it  theyre running a trial  on dogs at st sebastians out in philadelphia  ill make the call  what else could cause his estrogen level to be that high  nothing    were gonna put the medicine in here  dont want it to burn his veins when it goes in   and you have no idea if itll work   its shown promise in testing  mamaybe theres nothing up there i watched him like a hawk     pretty sure you didnt  l i didnt let him play with any more little toys  thus forcing him to shove a big one up there  stop or i snap your nose off  he hes not too smart  genetics is a powerful force  on the other hand maybe hes smarter than you think  whats goin on just give me a second  always wanted to use one of these    tilt his head back l i dont know i do  just tilt his head back            nice grasp of concepts relationships very smart  very cool  first the policeman the fireman then the fire truck  your brother was sending in teams to save the cat   wow  sometimes the simplest answer   what types of comas do you just snap out of  hes not snapping out of this one hes not improving  youve crossed out estrogen you got an explanation  yes i have a very simple one  and  its private    you think im the one running to vogler  youre currently top of the list   toxic comas  persons away from the cause long enough they recover  the feds checked for poisons we checked for poisons i didnt do it  its not a poison then an allergy   did you hear me  what about a food sensitivity  all his food is strictly controlled theres no correlation between his meals and his condition  he had steak and potatoes before the first coma  and the hospital served fish sticks before the second one  you can trust me  problem is if i cant trust you  i cant trust your statement that i can trust you  but thanks anyway youve been a big help  so where did you get the money what  someone paid you off what are you talkin about  he wasnt poisoned you told us that   whos talking about poison im talking about payoffs graft  leave him alone  you paid the marshal off  i didnt pay him to poison my brother  no it just worked out that way  i gave the guy some money to bring in some decent food  better than fish sticks im thinking steak  we asked for pasta but those stupid feds could care less  he had steak before both comas  your brother has ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency  want me to write it down  good cause it takes a while its genetic can present at any time  if the patient eats a large amount of protein especially if hes not used to it  what thats it he just stays off the red meat and hes gonna be fine  yes if im right and we stop the current treatment he gets better  if we stop the current treatment and im wrong he dies   why would you be wrong  his estrogen level  otd doesnt explain his estrogen level  but i have a theory  there is one chemical that if ingested  can cause a persons estrogen level to increase dramatically   what is it  its called estrogen  joeys taking estrogen what he wants a sex change  no nothing like that  its called male flame  its probably more consumerfriendly in the original chinese  its an herbal aphrodisiac marketed to gay men   ah here we go  and its sold on the same web site that sells his chai hu lozenges  guess whats in it it starts with an e  you wanna get hit too  that would be quite a trick he slapped me so hard his brother turned straight  joeys a bigtime mobster guys like that dont get raped in prison  they get gifts they get food drugs cigarettes  cable tv  joey is not gay  maybe not gay but certainly delightful  you on the other hand hitting a doctor even if it was only chase  and asking another one to keep joeys chart fresh and homofree  thats a bit of an overreaction wouldnt you say  its almost like youre scared that it might be true youre wrong  okay then dont stop the treatment  but if youre wrong he dies  okay  he never said anything to me about it not once  thats what i love about you mob guys so tolerant of others  so accepting  only way he was coming out was way way out  lose the tattoos change his name move to another town  hows a guy like him gonna do that  witness protection  its not just for witnesses anymore  you can go in now sit with him if you want   how much longer  its only been three hours   if its the otd   if its the otd what if house is wrong huh  that severe a reaction itll take some time   he makes these assumptions about people talks you into things  mr arnello  hes awake he wants to see you  you look like crap  thats a joke see im sick i said you look like crap  you have no idea what i just went through out there  you kept gettinworse  and dr house kept sayin all this crap  you know if if i think youre normal then hes gonna keep giving you the medicine   if you werent  werent what  normal  yeah  he said you were a fag  witness protection thats your big chance to be one   you believed him  i dont know what to believe  you were sick  i had to make a decision i thought you were gonna die  you believed him  he stopped the medicine  here i am   i wanted to talk to you about this  theres nothin to talk about  you uh  ordered some chinese internet health crap  and they sent the wrong pills and you took em  yeah yeah that uh  that must be it  you wanna testify  go ahead  i told the doc he said its okay   i dont expect you to understand  i dont  all i need to know is youre my brother joey  if you think this  thing whatever is gonna make you happy  then i think you should do it  you should  vogler wants to fire you  lose the whole department  good thing you fought for me though right  dress was a nice move but you gotta follow it up  nasty weekend in vegas  something that shows off your real administrative skills  he threatened to fire me  im sorry  so how long do i have ive got a lot of personal stuff to pack up  and i assume youre gonna want to throw a party  i told him i know where the bodies are buried  the stuff he needs to know thats not in the books i told him he cant ditch me  hes only keeping you on because you know the secret handshakes  hes a quick study six months hell have the moves down he wont need you anymore   ill deal with that then  so i stay  yes  but some things are going to change  profits new world order  everythings about profits yeah thats real new  you could rent out the corvette every once in a while or lend it to a friend  that would be easy and it would be wrong  but cuddy stood up for you   to a point  to what point  i gotta do six more clinic hours a month so do two of them  why only two  cause one of thems gone  i gotta fire somebody  good morning  thats some bad hat harry
