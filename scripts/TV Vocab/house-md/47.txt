discussion want to hear me thank you again  thank you doctor cuddy not just for removing the bullet  but thank you for putting me into a ketamineinduced coma  and changing my life happy i am  middleaged man had hair transplant about two months ago  infectionthrowing clots youre an idiot  except youre not an idiot  and she is holding a file for a 26yearold female  what have you really got for me  girl was doing an inverted yoga pose neck snapped  paralyzed from the neck down  except the xrays show no evidence of spinal injury  and shes cute  oh well played sir  what about stephen hawking trying to do the 500 butterfly  forget it brain cancer brain surgery theres nothing left to diagnose  i would take the other one  ill take them both  door closes  people chattering  you dont think he had brain cancer  of course he had brain cancer  even oncologists dont screw up for eight years  so if theres no diagnostic issue why are you taking the case  treatment can be interesting not to you  ive changed no you havent  no i havent so why are you taking the case  the guy tried to kill himself  the guy had cancer hes a lump  he hasnt been able to touch his wife speak to his kids  hes been in that chair for eight years his muscles have atrophied  maybe i can help him with the pain  isnt that enough of a reason to want to help  not for you ive changed  no you havent  then why am i taking this case  sighs  lets start with the cute paraplegic welcome back  hey you look  healthy  quad with no broken neck struck me as odd  you can take a whole two minutes to ease into being back  i wouldve taken a whole month to ease back  but eight weeks is the maximum rehab time  for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck so go  we heard they never found the guy theres no new leads  what you think he might have shot this patient too  it would explain her symptoms it could be ms  see its not so difficult its not ms  she had no symptoms before she climbed onto her head  unless shes been upsidedown for the last 10 years ms aint it  could be transverse myelitis swelling in the disks choking off nerve function  mri is negative for that  your leg looks fine totally painfree  when did this turn into what did you do over your summer vacation  its a little weird to discuss the case  while youre staring at your blood on the floor  i asked cuddy to replace the carpet  i like the carpet what did you do over the summer  i redo the tests  lets see if the source of the problem is in the limbs or the spine do an emg  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  weve got a whole other quad to cover this guys still got fluid in his lungs  you dont think thats from the pool he drank  give him an o2 mask his leg muscles have atrophied  tendons have shortened from disuse causing intense pain  tendon surgery will make him more comfortable  comfortable  scoot  thanks for being here  not a problem  my dad wouldnt kill himself  you havent spoken to him in over six years  i know my dad mark the doctors just trying to   he wouldnt kill himself  fine im wrong  you obviously have a better understanding of this man  who drools in front of your tv set 24 hours a day  doctor house  look he must have been confused all right it must have been an accident  i hope it was a suicide attempt  if he was trying to kill himself then he knows how miserable his life is  it means theres still something there to kill  it means your dads still there  sorry need you  thank you  we were doing the emg but we never got past the insertion of the conduction pin  did she just say thank you  i loaned her some money what went wrong  nothing went wrong  if nothing went wrong then something went right  youre not gonna tell me why she thanked you  youre not gonna tell me what went right  you did something for which she is grateful and youre embarrassed  for you she saw you coming up thought you were a 14 yearold boy  i set her straight  i am not telling you what went wrong or right  until you tell me why she said thank you  oh you got me you know i need to know i am so gonna fold  except youre forgetting theres one thing i can do now  its either that or a reflex response  what happened  okay  this is doctor house house this is caren  pleasures all mine what happened  when we inserted the conduction pin she flinched  she flinched did you hear  does that mean im getting better  how big is a flinch bigger than a twitch smaller than a spasm  do you smoke socially not a lot  you do yoga and you smoke  i know its hypocritical but  no the world sees your legs no ones checking out your lungs  how would smoking cause  it wouldnt i just needed a lighter  screams  house oh my god  the case was looking so promising hey im not faking  you moved therefore you can move  get this lunatic out of here before she bores again  im not faking  i heard you were watching surgery with a patients family  talking to a patients family  its because of your hallucination isnt it after you were shot  you chose life you decided you wanted meaning  so you took a case with no mystery something any doctor could do  a case with no upside except the satisfaction  of helping another human being  she thanked me  and you felt nothing  i wasnt sure what i was supposed to feel  its like your leg its atrophied keep working it the feeling will come  sorry need you again  i told you to get rid of her  its a good thing we didnt tightness in her chest  she cant breathe it could be pleural effusion  right either that or shes holding her breath like a fouryearold  gasping  relax im not gonna burn you again  im going to stab you  look either youre faking or youve got a pleural effusion  thats a buildup of fluid around the lungs which is very serious  and i would have no choice but to stab you in the back with this needle  and suck all of the fluid out of you  so cameron we should give her a local  that would defeat the point of me being nasty  ready  gasping  down she cant breathe if shes down  down she cant  down down down come on  gasping  thats not a pleural effusion  the problems in her heart  cant fake that  had to relieve the pressure three times in the last two hours  so either we figure out whats causing blood to build up around her heart  or i follow her around with a needle for the rest of her life  echo was clean no structural abnormalities  it could be an infectious process tb  or vasculitis would also explain the effusion  but not the paralysis lets assume that she wasnt faking it  she moved therefore she could move she wasnt paralyzed  doesnt mean she was faking it could have been a delusion  now either she was faking  and coincidentally got a real cardiac problem  at the exact same time or its a delusion  and the fake paralysis is a real neurological symptom  are you thinking vascular tumor on her spine  her platelets are normal  and shes been scanned up and down its all clean  so open her up and find it  foreman so what do you want us to do just start at her neck  and just keep on cutting down her spine until we stumble on something  that should work  his heart rates a little high should i be worried  probably just means hes still in discomfort from the surgery  im gonna up his morphine a little  youve been so nice to us  its the job  no i mean all the other doctors all they did was obsess on the cancer  the treatment the damage just trying to fix him  youre the first doctor thats ever given a damn about the quality of his life  his heart rates come down the morphine worked i was right  what a touching moment thats why we become doctors  for these rare moments when our hearts are warmed  would you like to get a drink  are you serious or are you just trying to change the subject  no im serious  i drink you drink we could do it at the same time the same table  if you eat we could do that too  i mean if the answers no thats cool but  no its just youre just coming off of surgery and youre not yourself yet  and i work for you and even though last years  youre smiling im saying no and youre smiling  well dont take it personally its just cause youre full of crap  you have no interest in going out with me maybe you did when i couldnt walk  when i was a sick puppy that you could nurture back to health  now that im healthy theres nothing in it for you  you are not healthy  cuddy wants to see you  youve been back at work  and youre already playing hideandseek in a womans spine  who won the pool  theres no tumor  her platelets are normal the scans didnt  whats the worst that can happen might paralyze her she wont even notice  her lawyers might youre not doing the surgery  and lower the morphine on your other patient  fine ill lower it if you let me do the surgery  what you want to trade  were not swapping a couple of goats for your help putting up a barn  you want something i want something we compromise  its the grownup way to resolve our differences  there already is a mechanism for that  its called the employeremployee relationship  i get what i want and you dont  you tried to swap  ran a few more tests they came back negative the surgerys on  you really dont give a crap do you  does that make me evil  yeah  the girls life is at stake all were talking about with the guy is  all were talking about is the reason you took the case to help someone  too bad for them too bad for you  the reason we crave meaning is because it makes us happy  the first level of happiness  im not going away  wilson the fifth level of happiness involves creation changing lives  house the sixth level is heroin the seventh level is you going away  youre saving lives which is tantamount to creating lives  but all youre taking away from this is the game  you dont have to listen to them thanking you  you dont have to change the cases you take or even how you handle them  you just have to know that you made a difference  house youre not im not an idiot  move surgeon house leave her alone  close her up you want to know why  the rooms no longer sterile  true but its not the most interesting reason  house that is not a sexy big toe  youd never put that in your mouth  what the hell does that got to do  i told you it was interesting but it gets even better  scurvy  yeah drink  like what sailors get when they dont eat right  aye aye your arms and leg tissues are choked with blood  it makes it hard to move it also damages your hair and toenails  but im on this great diet lots of protein lots of  no vitamin c now drink  slurping  well thank you  and thank doctor house  you can send him a note  the nurse changed his morphine i thought you were worried about  its just postop discomfort hes ready to go home  so he wont have any pain  eventually  thank you  everything else will be the same  well you took away his pain and that changes a lot  why dont you put him in some sort of facility  some place without a pool  yeah i could dump him there  except hes my husband  hes my sons father  right kids need a dad  someone to play catch with talk about girls  you know marks learning that you dont have to abandon someone  just because get a dog  im taking care of him for the same reason you helped us  because some guy shot you and you hallucinated  i have a responsibility  so hes just an anchor weighing you and your family down  sapping your energy wasting your life thats the meaning you take from this  i want to take care of him  you enjoy this  i cant abandon him  so you dont want to take care of him  taking care of him doesnt fulfill you make you happy  but not taking care of him would make you miserable  hmm  okay here we go  grunts  arlene okay slowly  i dont need your help ive done this a million times  here lie him like that  do that again make that sound  grunts  what was that  that was talking  you guys are lousy doctors  you were in such a rush to make the patient feel better  you forgot to check what was wrong  yoga girl walked out of here two hours ago you fixed her  not her the other guy he had brain cancer  they removed it eight years ago his conditions been the same ever since  until last night he spoke  whatd he say  grunts  he grunted  you want us to dissect eight years  of medical history with grunting in the differential  sounds good call me when youre done  youre fabricating a mystery because youre bored  i am not bored  damn it  you didnt tell the wife it was only a grunt  of course not  cause then she would never have consented to  i dont remember you being this bitchy  the vicodin dulled it in the sober light of day im a buzzkill  youre giving false hope to a family thats been wrecked  dont torture them let it go tell the wife it was only a grunt  tell her to go home  i cant let her down like that  i pumped her up with too much false hope  exclaims  i stuck that primo how rad am i  foreman  dry eyes plus a grunt  it all makes sense could be a neurological issue  i get hay fever i put drops in my eyes i dont go to a neurologist  dry eyes could indicate an autonomic dysfunction  it goes on the board  what about coughing or boogers  should we include boogers  im happy were doing this  id much rather do this than lengthen some guys tendon  patients headaches increased doc scanned his head found a tumor  you like wasting your time im learning  to do what reconsider solved cases  because you dont wanna deal with the real world  hes pushing where theres nothing  cameron you are an excellent doctor  youll get lots of tearful thankyous from grateful patients  yeah arent i such a bitch for wanting that  no its not a bad thing but its not why im here  i took this fellowship to learn from house  hes teaching you to be a masochist  dry eyes goes on the board  foreman in eight years the patient experienced  many of them repeated  any patterns  fever plus frequent urination could mean prostatitis  or a urinarytract infection  white count was normal no infection  foreman if you add pain into the mix fever  frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem  i like it  no creatinine and bun were both normal  not the kidney part the pain part  house abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst  perfect you managed to pick the one symptom he never had  abdominal pain  its the first symptom on the board grunt  grunting isnt pathognomonic for abdominal pain  no the traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm  vibration of the larynx leading to the audible sound  i have a pain in my abdomen  richards symptoms are culled from eight years of medical history  theyre not patterned these are random individual events over time  illnesses have incubation periods do an upper endoscopic ultrasound  his throat will collapse  muscle degeneration in his neck wont tolerate the scope  its an automatic trach youre talking about him  like hes an invalid  we were insensitive  does he drool can he hold his neck straight does he choke on his food  his necks fine his throats not gonna collapse  cameron get consent from the wife  open  i need you to swallow  sorry about that  here we go  were passing through the lower esophageal sphincter  into the antrum of the stomach  theres the tail of the pancreas  looks clean  moving medially the body and the head of the pancreas look clean  get it out get it out  its stuck i cant move it his throats collapsed  chokes  his vitals are all over the place were losing him  cutting  we trached him endoscopically removed the probe and hes breathing again  so all in all great idea  get a look at the pancreas before the world ended  it was clean  which means barring anything else  meaning you he can go home tomorrow  this man nearly died how can you discharge him  his throat collapsed because of what we predicted  you stick something down someones throat  they gag spasm which he did it took us a half an hour to get the thing out  except our patients throat was sedated  which means the brain should have sent a signal not to do anything  this could be cancer or some bizarre neurodegeneration  even a new type of vascular stop it youre enjoying this  i find it interesting  its interesting only if youre right  if youre wrong were torturing this guy to amuse you  half hour to remove the probe  house  its not a spasm  his throat didnt collapse it locked down  the brain is supposed to tell every muscle in the body to relax and contract  at the same time this muscle was only contracting  which means the signal from the brain was not getting through  there are no lesions on his brain nothing to interrupt any orders  all it takes is one wire down  you have no evidence of any wires down  a few microtumors on the meninges and suddenly youre choking to death  you want to look at the lining of his brain  the amount of contrast material you need to pump up there just to see  hell bleed into his brain no he wont  because that wouldnt be interesting you can get permission this time  house the brain is enclosed in a sack called the meninges  does this mean the cancers back  no no no no house  if we found cancer it wouldnt be the original cancer itd be new  so what more surgery more radiation  might not be the worst thing  if this isnt just ancient history then maybe its something we can correct  might even get some brain function back  he could get better  no  but understanding what youre saying will be nice  maybe you could figure out ways to communicate  thank god he spoke to you  mrs mcneil the test to do this is very risky he could die  hes already dead  foreman chase go slow  ive already injected it into his spinal canal  next stop his brain  foreman contrast material entering into the fourth ventricle  no parenchymal bleeds  chase blood pressures high but its holding  meninges are intact no bleeding  oh god foreman get in here  surgeon repaired the csf leak  youre lucky he didnt die  im lucky hes the one who didnt die  we told you hed hemorrhage  you told me hed bleed into his brain not out of his ear  youve got to drop this  were missing something  we did a dangerous test and something bad happened thats all this is  give me a tour of the brain foreman walk me through the scans   fivecentimeter gradefour astrocytoma between the parietal  nothing next the speck on the superior temporal region  its a regrowth benign  the star thingy next to the rathke cleft  scar tissue from a biopsy  house every speck is not a suspect  its years of surgeons digging around in his head let him go  redo every blood test hes ever had rescan his head  no  hes been sick and suffering for eight years im not gonna help you make it worse  im not gonna help you make it interesting  thats okay foremans better at that stuff than you are  we need fivemillimeter cuts through the occipital and hypothalamic regions  no  how many millimeters  house i can help him  thats it thats your argument  it seems like a good one  if i thought for a second you wanted to help him youd have carte blanche  youre doing this because its fun  does nobody in this hospital  have anything better to talk about than my motives  my motives have nothing to do with the case  your motives have everything to do with your judgment  for the first time in years i got no opiates in my body  now you question my judgment  twentyfour times a year you come storming into my office  spouting that you can help someone only you never say those words  you say something like  his pancreas is gonna explode because his brain is on fire  you come here with medicine not with platitudes  i didnt wanna bore you with the details  there are no details you have a hunch  house you dont use hunches you always have reasons  this hospital doesnt exist for your whims im sorry  as of 700 am tomorrow morning im sending your patient home  the answers no  cuddy called 30 seconds after you left and said youd try an endaround  door closes  my leg hurt  how bad  enough that im telling you  did it go away  ached for a while  first time ive felt anything there since the surgery  but it went away  it was muscular there was some cramping  what are you smiling about  youre 40something years old  youve been running god knows how many miles a day  fallen a hundred times off that skateboard and youre shocked to have some soreness  just give me a prescription  for vicodin  house people get aching joints cramps  they put on an ice pack they take some ibuprofen  i know what the pangs of middle age feel like  no you dont because youve been stuffing vicodin  every five minutes since you turned middleaged  the surgery didnt work  dont play me  you think this is a scam  i think you want me to feel sorry for you  and either do the endaround on cuddy or give you the drugs  either way you get the high you think you need  house your surgery worked youre fine its just gonna take time for it to feel good  knock on door  gasps  sighs  circumventricular system senses cytokines  released in the early stages of the immune response  but cvos releases prostaglandins  that reset the hypothalamic set point upward  unless its countered by antipyretic therapy so yeah his brain is on fire  the suicide attempt was not a suicide attempt  he drove that wheelchair into the pool  because he couldnt regulate his body temperature  he had a hypothalamic dysregulation  and you discovered this when you stepped into the university pool  fountain i can cure him  cure him  even if the fountain proved anything  fixing hypothalamic dysregulation isnt gonna regenerate brain  no but if the scar tissue on his hypothalamus  is resting against the pituitary  the adrenals would shut down addisons disease  you didnt see any scar tissue on his mri his ct scans  his brain is functional his temperatures normal  there is nothing wrong with his hypothalamus or his pituitary  i can make him walk i can make him talk this is a wild guess  that came to you because you were sweating  inject him with cortisol the guy will have sex with his wife again  hell hug his kid again hopefully thats the combination he was using  itd be a shame if i had cured a pedophile  youre smiling thats a bad sign  youre high  i told you i havent had anything in three months  this is as high as you get  a theory that ties your case up in a neat little bow  but you dont have a lick of substantiating proof  sighs  your decision doesnt make any sense there is no risk to a cortisol injection  if im wrong big deal  he goes home a vegetable like he already is but if im right  this is not about downsides or risk management  it is a big deal for you to understand the word no  sighs  im sorry house  hes on his way out of here  i figured youd be on your scooter racing down the halls  to stab the patient in the neck with cortisol  she was right to say no  i had no objective reason to think that i was right  just needed the puzzle  hold on a sec  is everything all right  yeah its just something i forgot  whats that  this is cortisol and its to fight infection  want to hold onto that lets put a bandage on it  is he okay  yes  can we go now  you can go  excuse me  gasping  richard richard  dad you okay  richard richard richard  richard  richard  richard youre standing  grunts  thank you  cudd y he got up  i have to go tell house  no cuddy you cant tell him  i have to tell him he was right  why did you do it why did you think he might be right  because hes house  medically what made you think he was right  nothing he got lucky thats all that happened  telling him no was a good thing  because next time he wont get lucky hell kill someone  just because he was right doesnt mean he wasnt wrong  exhales  i see him every day i cant just  everybody lies  cant always get what you want playing
