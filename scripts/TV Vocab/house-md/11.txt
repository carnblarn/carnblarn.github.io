we had some way to communicate with another part of the building  sixteenyearold mva victim  hes been in and out of the hospital for three weeks with internal bleeding no one can find the cause  internal bleeding after a car accident wow thats shocking  let me talk to shipping i speak their language  its been three weeks your hospital doesnt have my pain medication  shipping says its going to be an hour  this is dr cuddy whats going on  the crash didnt cause the bleed right the bleed caused the crash  blood got on the road got all slippery anyone here got drugs  she saw his blood she got distracted and she crashed his dads porsche   dadll love that  he was   dont talk  its gonna be an hour  thank god you took control   if you cant wait one hour to get  kids got hemolytic anemia  kid how old  he must have inherited it hes gonna die my condolences  wasnt inherited the problems outside the red blood cells  this is impossible a 16yearold does not get hemolytic anemia  give her back the file you have bigger problems to tend to like my meds  elevated indirect bilirubin low serum haptoglobin   hes got meningitis  uh no   artificial heart valve  no  get everyone in my office  kids gonna be dead in a matter of days  if we dont figure out why his red blood cells are disintegrating  so differential diagnosis people well its not environmental  dad hired a company to clean the house maid washed all the clothes  and bought hypoallergenic sheets and pillows   you want us to recheck  no  if its environmental hell get better just from staying here   it could be an infection  no fever no white count   well hes 992  barely above normal  but above his bodys reacting to something   we could account for the lack of fever and white count if its lupus   drugs will fit just as much as lupus meth will cause hemolytic anemia   a lot of meth   also doesnt exactly seem like the type  because his dad drives a porsche rich kids do drugs just like poor kids  didnt mean to offend you okay  so its infection lupus drugs or cancer   cancer  why not great meeting  shouldnt we narrow it down before we finish  my leg gave us till 1115  ill talk to wilson about lymphoma ana for lupus  radioimmunoassay for drugs  and you test for whatever you thought it was  ive got a date with the pharmacist  thats already done and   come on come on come on come on  yeah  excuse me  you know there are other ways to manage pain  like what laughter  meditation got a guy that can fix my third chakra  youre addicted  if the pills ran my life id agree with you but its my leg thats busy calendaring what i cant do  youre in denial  right i never had an infarction in my leg no dead muscle no nerve damage  doesnt even hurt actually it kinda tickles  and chicks dig this  better than a puppy  its not just your leg you wanna get high  youre doing what  no thats way too much  moderation is the key unless theres pain  its double what you were taking when i hired you  cause youre twice as annoying  i cant always be here to protect you  patients talk doctors talk  about how big your ass has gotten lately not me i defend it  you got back    you cant go a week without the drugs no i dont wanna go without the drugs  itll hurt no you cant  if youre just getting off pain medication it will hurt  you wont be having a great time but youll make it  if youre detoxing youll have chills nausea  your pain will magnify five ten times  you wont make it well i guess well never know  ill give you a week off clinic duty if you can go a week without narcotics  no way i love the clinic  you love the pills two weeks  the pills dont make me high they make me neutral a month  youre on mister  drugs could cause this cocaine and meth are very hard on the blood system  has he had any erratic behavior no but  she was in rehab in the ninth grade  shes supposedly clean now but she obviously cares for him  yeah what she cared about was the car  anniversary present for my wife  we drove it up north to watch the leaves change  she was dead a year later  cancer im sorry  mr foster were gonna test keith for drugs  l i dont do drugs  its not that we dont trust you but   his hair will tell us any drugs hes taken over the past 60 days  its kind oflike rings on a tree  negative   have you been sick  no nothing   have you been out of the country  we went to china but we got all our shots before we left   it could be an infection  were going to give him a gallium scan just to be safe  we inject a radioactive isotope into his bloodstream  and we check to see if theres inflammation anywhere in the body  has he ever complained of anyjoint pain  sensitivity to light rashes   no no nothing  any relatives whove ever been diagnosed with lupus  i dont even know what that is  in simple terms the body becomes allergic to itself  the immune system attacks healthy cells in the circulatory system and destroys them  would it be treatable  it can be manageable  we can test for the antibodies  ninetyfive percent of patients with lupus have positive ana  not cloudy negative  what about bruising never complained of tenderness under his arms or his groin  im not sure hed tell me ifhe did  i guess i dont really know whats going on in his life   hes a teenager  yeah  what type of cancer did your wife have  pancreatic  its his lymph nodes were concerned about  were going to do a biopsy to check for lymphoma  can you feel this no  good  i have cancer dont i  were just testing    thats what they told my mom  definitely not cancer   nothing  nothing  negative for drugs ana was negative gallium scan was clear  yeah i got that from the nothing   wheres his hematocrit  thirteen  drops any lower hes not gonna have enough red blood cells to bring oxygen to his body  hell suffocate with his lungs working perfectly you okay  excuse me someone help please  polite for a dying kid  how long has it been  im fine   theres something in my eye up at the top  which eye  this one whats happening  its all right just look down for me  its clear theres nothing in it   its getting worse  is it fuzzy or  no its dark  i cant see   its a retinal clot in the left eye  coumadin would dissolve the clot fix his eyesight  you cant use blood thinners hes got internal bleeding  fix the eye youd kill everything else surgerys out for the same reason  we have two hours to figure this out either we restore the blood flow or he loses the eye  forget the eye tell him to use the other one to look on the bright side  the clot tells us something  could help us figure out what he has which could mean he gets to live  differential diagnosis people  how does internal bleeding suddenly start clotting  it makes no sense theyre opposing processes  it can happen in lupus increased platelet count can cause blood clots  ana was negative its not lupus  this is true but why are you the one saying it  what are you doing here i thought wed ruled out cancer  i was lonely  well go see cuddy she needs a friend  thats funny she said you might need one  thats why youre here she wants you to keep an eye on me make sure i dont cheat  no i wanted to make sure you dont start firing shots from the clock tower  im fine   whats going on  he hasnt had vicodin in over a day   does your leg hurt  you ever been shot  theres gonna be side effects insomnia depression tachycardia  withdrawal symptoms not applicable  the only side effects im gonna have are some pain and 30 days of freedom  am i the only one whos concerned about a dying kid  if its not lupus what else  most likely candidate for throwing a clot is infection or cancer  checked the biopsy twice its not cancer  its not an infection gallium scan didnt reveal anything  okay what hides from a gallium scan  cardiac right  clot flicks off travels through the arteries then gets backed up in the eye  im sorry i wasnt paying attention what happened  its an infection in his heart  great  echocardiogram for the heart and iv antibiotics for the infection stat  is it my birthday  im not lonely my leg hurts   shes a real masseuse  shes 500 an hour minimum  shes hot so shes a hooker what kind of pathetic logic is that  the envious jealous lnevergotanyinhighschool kind of logic hello  shes a legitimate masseuse  come on  god shes beautiful  because shes beautiful i should do it what kind of pathetic logic is that  the envious jealous immarriedandlcantdoanything logic hello  hi uh listen im sure youre really good at whatever it is you do but  deme su mano huh   hey no no let go of my hand  she doesnt speak english  shh  ow  owahh  ahh  oh my god  bueno  take off your clothes  not a fan of the stroganoff  im not hungry well the antibiotics can cause nausea  so can the food  shouldnt you be looking at my eye  the blood clot isnt lifethreatening  were focusing on figuring out the cause of your problems  so the so the blindness will be permanent wont it  thank you bye  i had a massage  looks like you had a masseuse help the pain  im fine i know  kids echo was normal no signs of any vegetations on heart valves  never met a diagnostic study i couldnt refute  and the antibiotics arent doing anything  so double the dosage  thatll box his kidneys for sure  oh youre right save the kidney  the guy we transplant it into will be grateful  also i have an idea for his eye nothing we can do about his eye  hes got a clot in the retina put it in a memo  if we remove some of the liquid from the eye itself the vitreous humour  it might make some extra room around the retinal artery  if the artery expands the clot might move on its own thats very creative  why didnt you mention this before  i didnt think of it before  you shouldve    this is going to hurt  your eye is numb youll only feel pressure  give it a minute  i can see    i can see you  i heard congratulations  dont i havent brushed my teeth in two days    im so scared theyre not gonna find out whats wrong with you  no biggie im fine  i feel so bad about all this its all my fault  no no its not  but your father he hates me  hes just pissed about his car     help help help    whats wrong  ast is 859 were getting him to the icu  alt and ggt are in the tank our antibiotics   would not have caused this she must have given him drugs   i wouldnt do that  its not drugs  his liver is shutting down what  what does that mean it means hes all better hes ready to go home  what what do you think it means  you cant live without a liver hes dying  what is your problem bum leg whats yours  hey we dont have time for this lets go  his sons dying and youre mocking him  it was a dumb question  no it wasnt  youre right it wasnt  is proving cuddy wrong worth all this   you know house shouldnt even be here  because he said something inappropriate  if we sent him home every time he did that we wouldnt need this office   hes in pain   what does the man have to do to piss you off   hes been without pain relief for over 70 hours  exactly  hes detoxing cant you see hes out of his mind   thats what they said about manson  do you wanna continue talking about me  or should we discuss what the liver damage tells us  i was born in a log cabin in illinois  hemolytic anemia doesnt cause liver damage  add the fact hes coughing blood  youve got three of the indicators of organthreatening lupus  its moving too fast  could be hepatitis e  theres only been one case of hep e originating in the us since  his history says hes been in and out of the country four times in the last year  you really think hes got hep e  no i think lupus is way more likely  all right then lets start him on iv cytoxan and plasmapheresis  no we should rule out hep e  you just said it wasnt hep e  i said lupus is way more likely but if we treat for lupus and it is hep e  hes toast exactly  but there isnt a treatment for hepatitis e  either hell get better on his own or hell continue to deteriorate  yeah i went to medical school too  start him on solumedrol   if hes got hep e thats only gonna make him worse  not as much  its goldilocks people  wont hurt him so much that itll kill him and it wont hurt him so little that we cant tell  itll hurt him just right  and if it does nothing  well know its not hep e and can start treating for lupus  now watch me do it while drinking a glass of water  what do we tell the dad we think your kid has lupus so were gonna treat him for hepatitis e  and oh yeah if it really is hep e were not actually giving him hep e  medication  so its gonna make him worse not better think hell go for that   so you want us to lie  no   i want you to lie  why me  because he trusts you   this is a mistake  this is a lawsuit  hep e is possible  house always pulls these stunts and hes right more often  hes delaying treatment because of a oneinamillion chance that even he doesnt think is the problem  i dont wanna lie to him then dont  and get fired oh like hes gonna fire you he loves you   ive gotta do something   kid needs treatment  treat him for lupus  that will get you fired  you really think house is losing it   yeah  hes fine he knows what hes doing           okay   were recommending a drug called solumedrol  for hepatitis did that show up on his blood tests  the tests are never 100 accurate  well then all the other tests could be wrong too  this could still be an infection or cancer um  they dont fit any of the most recent symptoms  well what just hepatitis does  i know i know i know you can never be sure  when wendy was in the hospital  a doctor told us there was this aggressive experimental treatment  which might extend her life by two or three years  well we figured if there was any hope at all that we could have her with us a little while longer itd be worth it  three weeks later she was gone  i dont think its hepatitis  i think your son has lupus  i think its broken  what did you do  accidentally closed the car door on it  no door wouldve broken the skin  this looks like something hard and smooth smashed it  i want my lawyer  the brain has a gating mechanism for pain  registers the most severe injury and blocks out the others  did it work well my hand hurts like hell  yeah i feel much better huh  dont splint it  i want to be able to bang it against the wall if i need to administer another dose  just tape it up  why did you tell cameron to lie to mr foster  make it tight answer me    nothing i can say is gonna change how you feel  and nothing can come out of your reaction that is gonna change what i plan to do  so i prefer to say nothing  so that was just you saying nothing  uhhuh   the guy is furious  and scared  so what are you gonna do the fathers insisting on the lupus treatment  yeah cameron told me and i told her to tell him no  well you cant just sit back and let the kid die  neither can the father so thats your plan  youre gonna play chicken with the kids life  well hes the dad i should win easily  take the week off  why cause i lied to a patient  i take risks sometimes patients die  but not taking risks causes more patients to die  so i guess my biggest problem is ive been cursed with the ability to do the math   i told him that we wouldnt treat him for the lupus until   whatd he say  he said he wanted to transfer keith to another hospital  hes not stable enough hed never make it through the door thats what i told him  and thats when he caved  yeah he agreed to do it your way  two plus two equals four  if it is hepatitis e we should see a marked decline in liver function tests within the hour  why bother explaining it to me its not like i have any choice in the matter  if theres no hep e well start treatment for lupus immediately  ouch   keith whats wrong  whats happening  no get off  keith its dr chase where does it hurt jules no   hes hallucinating  is this from the medicine   we havent started the medicine  keith youre in the hospital keith theres nothing on you   hey hey keith  keith keith keith  hey you okay buddy    um i think i wet the bed  oh dont worry about it its fine lets get you up    oh god  hes had a major bleed   bright red blood per rectum  i didnt i didnt mean to im sorry   hes going into hypovolemic shock   pressures 60 heart rates 140  we need an angiography stat    angiography revealed major upper and lower gi bleeding  severe hemodynamic compromise and liver failure  hes also hallucinating thinks hes being tortured by someone named jules  hallucinations are a symptom of psychosis  which is the fourth diagnostic criterion  its official this is lupus  whos jules  any mention of her in the medical history  it doesnt matter what hes hallucinating about it matters why its lupus  well theres no need to get snippy  this kind oflupus takes years to get to this point  its been a week yeah  and a 16yearold kid shouldnt have hemolytic anemia or be bleeding out of every orifice but he is  we had an opportunity to treat this instead we diddled around with hepatitis eand now its too late  he needs a new liver we screwed up  youre saying i screwed up   yes  then why dont you just say that   you gonna blame this on her  did you agree with my recommendation to treat for hep e   no i didnt  and she made herself quite clear   and then she went and lied to the father thats why youre angry  yeah i trusted you  you always trust me thats a big mistake  lupus is a bad diagnosis   its the best diagnosis weve got  that doesnt make it good  no itjust makes it this kids only chance to live  put him on the transplant list  and make sure cuddy knows  see if she can do anything to get him close to the top      cafeteria  stay away from the sushi  and what happened to your hand  got stuck in a drawer  yeah right youre going through withdrawal  no i am going through pain  pain causes nausea   i took this job to work with you not cover your ass  your vicodin  and your solution is to give me drugs  thats interesting no  now im covering my ass  take your pills before you kill this kid        lupus is normally treated with medication  but in keiths case the disease is too advanced  because you lied because house wanted to play games with my sons life  theres no way to really tell what progression the disease may have taken youre right  and im sorry    so what do we do  he needs a new liver  there are over 15000 patients on the transplant list  but how many are about to bleed to death unless they get a new liver  in jersey id say uh 20  two thousand patients die each year because a donor liver cant be found thats almost five a day  so hes screwed  ill see what i can do   could i donate part of my liver  sorry youre a different blood type  so we just wait im afraid so  and hope for someone to die  whos jules  dr house you should get back to your office jules   theres nojules in the history  it was a hallucination  of what our cat  does this matter  no im sorry  well continue the transfusions and the treatment for the anemia and liver failure while were waiting for a donor   how long can he wait  not long   i dont think this is lupus  its lupus come on lets just go  your fourth diagnostic criterion for lupus is psychosis  this is just a kid missing his cat  he was being attacked by an animal that wasnt in the room  thats psychosis theres a difference between psychosis and hallucination  so if he was imagining a fake cat itd be lupus but since it was a real cat its not   take your damn pills  psychosis requires  there is no cat  jules is dead  you have a dead family pet and you never mentioned it  nice family history  family historys asking about family members meaning people related to the patient  how did the cat die can you get him outta here   dr house come on lets  what happened to the cat  old age   she was 15 years old  when  about a month ago   does this have anything to do with  whered she sleep  with keith this is not a cat allergy  and its not lupus  where is jules    four years of college  four at med school  two years of residency  another four of subspecialty training and where do i end up  talking instead of digging  come on the grounds frozen solid      whats that    out of the way  we have the liver prep or four    all right keith start counting backward from ten  ten  nine  eight  scalpel     stop the gases  what the hell are you doing house  saving a 16yearold kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs and a very nasty scar  this kid doesnt have lupoid hepatitis  he has acute naphthalene toxicity  naphthalene yyyoure talking about mothballs  nope termites  they create naphthalene to protect their nests  which im assuming is rather large and inside all four walls of his bedroom at home  and your assumption is based on what  the autopsy i just conducted on his pet cat   call cuddy and security  you are not removing that kids liver  now     have you completely lost your mind  no but i have been feeling a little sick lately  ahchoo   theres no way we can do this surgery now ya think  youve already cost him his liver dont kill him too  why are you so eager to cut into a healthy kid  healthy hes in the toilet he just needs some chicken soup   im telling hourani to rescrub were doing this transplant  no youre not  you said it if keiths symptoms had an environmental cause they would have disappeared as soon as he got here  theyve only gotten worse  if the food here wasnt one step below rikers island he wouldve gotten better   hes lost 14 pounds  sure this is nothing but a dietary thing  naphthalene is a gas a fatsoluble gas  kid breathes it in it gets stored in his fat cells  outside the hospital his body burned protein and carbs for energy  and the naphthalene stayed in fat  but once the car accident put him in the hospital and he started losing weight  his body had to get its energy somewhere else  it started to burn fat  the floodgates opened  the poison poured into his system  so getting away from the poison is what poisoned him  getting away from his dads meat loaf is whats killing him  you wanna explain to me why you stopped the surgery  oh my god my god   i want him locked up   hey  take it easy  your cat did not die of old age  it died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure  caused by naphthalene poisoning  the exact same thing your son has  you lie to me you mess up my sons surgery and now you expect me to trust you  give me 24 hours well pump your son full of calories   that liver is going to somebody right now  were doing that surgery  you do the surgery youll be killing a mother of four  father of three   i was guessing  like you are now  naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation we have for whats wrong with your son  it explains the internal bleeding the hemolytic anemia the liver failure  it also predicts whatll happen next  if you do the surgery hes gonna lay on that table for 14 hours  while his body continues to burn fat and release poison into his system  either way i did you a favor  hes awake now youve got a chance to say goodbye  i think you should trust dr house  give the liver to the other guy  watch out  inrs down and his red count is climbing  means you made the right call  his liver is healing hes gonna be just fine    you made it a week  and won my prize  congratulations cuddys a sucker  i wouldve done it for two weeks off  yeah it was a piece of cake  you learn anything  yeah  im an addict  uh  okay  im not stopping  there are programs  cuddy would give you the time  you could get on a different pain management regimen i dont need to stop  you just said  i said i was an addict i didnt say i had a problem  i pay my bills i make my meals i function  is that all you want you have no relationships  i dont want any relationships   you alienate people  ive been alienating people since i was three  oh come on drop it  you dont think youve changed in the last few years  well of course i have ive ive gotten older my hairs got thinner  sometimes im bored sometimes im lonely sometimes i wonder what it all means  no i was there  you are not just a regular guy whos getting older  youve changed youre miserable and youre afraid to face yourself  of course ive changed  and everythings the leg  nothings the pills they havent done a thing to you  they let me do my job  and they take away my pain    howd it go  he admitted hes addicted to the narcotics  well admitting you have a problem is the first and he says its not a problem  maybe its not  what do i know  what are you gonna do nothing done enough damage  better hope he never finds out that that was your idea hed never believe it  thats some bad hat harry
