                beautiful playing on stereo  singing to all your friends youre delirious  so consumed in all your doom  trying hard to fill your emptiness  the piece is gone  tenminute warning im fine  what about your meds got it mom  singing you are beautiful no matter what they say  ghostly wailing  house sneezing  wilson house  need you forget it im going home  hay fever oh you must be a doctor and everything  two minutes no  the purple thingie on the file means that whoever is one of yours  which means cancer which means no way its two minutes  fine im iying  woman chattering on pa system  mystery of iife benadryl might help  aiready did steam room  why jimmy weii talk about this in the morning  i got a 9yearold with cancer aiveolar rhabdomyosarcoma  terminal kid trumps your stuffy nose not yet  shes hallucinating  so the rhabdos in her brain  make her comfortable shes got about a week  yeah except there is no cancer in her brain  pristine ct scan blood tests protein markers all negative  the cancers in remission  which means the hallucinations are unconnected  fascinating huh  and not that it matters but if you fix whatevers going on in her head  you give her maybe another year long time for a 9yearold  no itii just fly by  five major surgeries a bone marrow transplant  fourteen rounds of chemo and blast radiation  if it was me id just stay home and watch tv or something  not iie here under a microscope  house sneezes  dont worry anything happens to you nobodys gonna iift a finger  differential diagnosis  on your marks get set hallucinations could be caused by  whoa wait for it  and go  iatent neurotoxicity from the chemo treatments  no patients iast round of chemo was two months ago  we wouldve seen it by now genetic component  nothing on mom dad split when she was pregnant  his medical historys also clean what a guy  what about graft versus host disease from the bone marrow transplant  infection travels to her brain she has hallucinations  biood work and lp were clean  but where theres infection theres meningeal swelling  that ct shows no meningeal involvement true  get a tox screen and an mri  we can do that if you wanna ignore what we just discussed  sounds good  toxic exposure doesnt make any chronological sense  i guess there is a third option shes making it all up  because she doesnt wanna get in trouble for breaking a mirror  unfortunately we cant test for that so tox screen mri  and you stay away from the patient whatd i do  oh well youii just get all warm and cuddly around the dying girl  and insinuate yourself probably end up in a custody battle  chase you handle the mom  tell her that youd just sit home and watch tv and die  but youve got to go through the motions  and try to save her daughters iife its a doctor thing  what the hell is this biack walnut and ginger  its nice  iii just iay you down and iii attach this thingamajiggy  sat monitor oh a pro dont have to explain anything  i iike it  central iine for the chemo yeah doesnt hurt or anything does it  no its awesome  instead of an iv it saves me a iot of time and a bunch of needle sticks  oh i dont think ive ever heard anyone say they iike their central iine before  aii right can i interest you in a walk in the park  water gurgling  no thanks okay  dont want any butterflies either  doesnt matter what the walls iook iike youre still iooking for cancer  not today were iooking for an infection but i get your point  you comfortable yup  aii right lets get this over with a pro  i iike it  whoa look at the time  i shouldve been out of here  youve only been here i cant slip anything by you can i  theres a patient in one nah im taking a sick day  take some ciaritin everyones a doctor suddenly  patient in one requested a male doctor  balls are in your court doctor union rules  i cant check out this guys seeping gonorrhea this close to iunch  exam room one  well its sexist and a very dangerous precedent  if people could choose the sex of their doctors  you gals would be out of business exam room one  sore throat  well its not iupus well not everyone can operate a zipper  you know the up down what comes next  my new girlfriend never been with a guy  who wasnt circumcised  so she freaked and ahha  and you wanted rivkah to feel all gemutlicht i get it  its a shandah  exclaiming  i got some box cutters and just iike abraham did it  i sterilized them which i was told  stop talking  im gonna get a plastic surgeon get the twinkie back in the wrapper  foreman house hey house  andies mri and tox screen were clean no infection no neurotoxins  woman chattering on pa system  oxygen saturation is 94 check her heart  her oxygen saturation is normal  its off by one percentage point its within range its normal  if her dna was off by one percentage point shed be a dolphin  weve got a patient who for no obvious reason is hallucinating  since its not obvious i thought wed go with subtle  it doesnt matter if her sat percentage is off  that means her blood isnt getting enough oxygen  thats a problem with her iungs not her heart  and a iung problem isnt causing hallucinations  but the iungs could iead us somewhere that is  welcome to the end of the thought process primary pulmonary hypertension  maybe pe or pulmonary fibrosis  could be some bizarre case of kyphoscoliosis  im going home  while im resting you guys get some arterial blood gases  once you confirm that she is hypoxic i want a plethysmography  chest xray ct and vq  but if all that comes back negative then snake a catheter into her iungs  dont worry if i dont sleep in iii get bagels  you ever had this test before whats it for  this goes all the way up the vein by your hip into your iung  if i find something up there blocking anything i pull it out simple  its gonna be easy the doctor at sioan told me i had a great aorta  oh you have had this test before sorry i just iike hearing you talk  monitors beeping  ive never kissed a boy  theres time yet for that  there was a boy iast summer  i was at one of those cancer camps i just never had the guts to ask him  you know theres a good chance im not gonna walk out of this hospital  even if i do im nine  not a iot of kissing going on in the third grade  you will walk out of here all right and you will kiss a boy  there you go a smile  will you kiss me  no no one will ever know  stuttering im sorry i cant  i wont tell anyone listen youre nine years old  im 30  i just wanna know what it feels iike once  this isnt your iast chance for that  what if it is  piease kiss me  bagels foreman you didnt sleep in  didnt sleep didnt breathe im dying  chase pulmonary angiogram of andies iungs was clean  arterial blood gases and ct scan were also normal  her heart and iungs are fine  which gives us no explanation for the diminished sat percentage  yeah oddly enough sometimes normal is normal  sometimes we cant see why normal isnt normal  get her symptoms on the board youre ietting me touch the markers  its written out in my advanced health care directive  should i be incapacitated in any way you run the board  then foreman chase youre just not ready yet  house what else guys i know we sort of ruled out infection  but if we forget the iabs for a minute  there is one infection we didnt test for because of her age  neurosyphilis theres no way  if the infection dipped into her cerebral cortex  all peripheral functions could be compromised  no she hasnt had sex shes nine  maybe it wasnt her idea i mean shes been around a iot of adults  aii the hospital visits the counselors at the cancer camps  you think shes been molested  and hiding it pretty well if theres any of that going on  yeah aii girls whove been molested wanna talk about it  break out the rape kit she hasnt had sex  why are you so sure she told me shed never kissed a boy  you read her diary too she asked me to kiss her  house i rest my case  a regular 9yearold girl does not have sex on the brain  not when a doctors threading a catheter through her vein  but shes not a regular 9yearold shes got terminal cancer  cancer doesnt make you special  molestation on the other hand she wanted one kiss before she dies  if shes never kissed a boy its a fair bet shes never had sex  tell that to all the hookers who wont kiss me on the mouth  hey heres a theory she has been molested  seeks refuge in romantic fantasies with older men with great hair  and i think you ieft out the punchline  victims of molestation iearn to work the angles manipulate people  you did it didnt you you kissed her  it wasnt sick it was one kiss for a dying girl  one small one small kiss before she dies  thank you thanks  this is exactly why you cant touch my markers  go see if shes had sex okay  no ones ever touched me we just need to be sure  i iike your hair  i used to have really curly hair i always wanted it to be iike yours is  thank you  aii right thats it youre fine  with a patient she dying  no then she can wait  wilson will you excuse me just two minutes  if only shed been molested then wed have something to go on  house no forced entry one hallucination  maybe it was just bad pork maybe theres nothing  shes not fine  her sat percentage dropped another point which could suggest a tumor in her iung  lung wouldnt explain the hallucination  ct scans showed both iungs were clean  which means theres a tumor in her heart not a chance give me that  i ioosened it i opened it  weve got an mri and an echo of her heart theres nothing there  give me one other explanation for iow oxygen saturation  i cant theres only one condition that simultaneously affects  the heart and brain but she perfect iets go with that  tuberous sclerosis in a kid that also has alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma  two different unrelated cancers at the same time is a statistical nono  whats the rate of cancer in the general population  one in 10000 dont dont start with the numbers  way i figure it one in 10000 of them should have another cancer  little girl won the iottery twice  it happens so youre gonna cut her open  exploratory surgery i gotta find this thing  youre just gonna grope around inside an immunocompromised  she could die on the table i know its somewhere near the heart  houseyouve got to do better than that  opera music playing  why are we here  better acoustics now iisten to this  whooshing  its a mitral heart valve no get the wax out of your ears  this is the patients aortic valve  i downloaded the audio of her echocardiogram  what are we trying to hear tumor  they tend to keep quiet on account of them not having any mouths  but we could hear an abnormality in the sound of the valve  which would indicate the presence of something  the tumor for example if we could tell the surgeon where to iook  this is no ionger an exploratory surgery its a precision strike  her aortic valve sounds normal too bad  now iisten to the dulcet tones of andies tricuspid valve  slow beating  normal and this is her mitral valve  rhythmic beating  i dont hear anything weird  you guys make me sad listen again  shes had one hallucination why are we operating on her  why are we risking her iife  because wilson thinks itd be nice to give the girl a year  to say goodbye to her mommy  guess maybe she stutters or something now shut up and iisten  tricuspid  slow beating  mitral  rhythmic beating  again cameron wait  there  theres an extra flap  im gonna ask the surgeon to iook at the mitral valve first  chase i want you there  i dont iike reading surgeons reports theyre boring  im not really sure i should be spending more time with her  sheii be unconscious youii be safe  iii be there when you wake up im gonna be fine mom  woman chattering on pa system  brave kid she even gave her mom a pep talk  mature brave shes a wonder  whats your problem  these cancer kids you cant put them all on a pedestal  its basic statistics some of them have got to be whiny iittle fraidycats  youre unbelievable  if theres not one yellowbelly in the whole group  then being brave doesnt have any meaning  andie handles an impossible situation with grace  thats not to be admired  you see grace because you wanna see grace  you dont see grace because you wont go anywhere near her  house idolizing is pathological with you people  you see things to admire where theres nothing  yeah well were evil  you find things to admire where you shouldnt be sniffing at all  like debbie in accounting shes nice  you shouldnt know that youre married  so the iittle kid dying of cancer i shouldnt iike her  if youre dying suddenly everybody ioves you  you have a cane nobody even iikes you im not terminal merely pathetic  you wouldnt believe the crap people iet me get away with  monitor beeping  they found a tumor its in her iung extending into her heart  it wasnt visible on the mri because its growing along the heart wall  now because of the placement  the surgeon has to temporarily remove andies heart  its called an explant they cut out the tumor  replace any damaged heart muscle with bovine patches  thats a patch made from the cows pericardium  its a sac that encloses the heart  what are her chances  the problem is there might not be enough heart ieft  once they remove all of the tumor  and if the tumors metastasized theres nothing we can do  dr murphy just iet me tie this off  doctor what  shes got a bleed in her eye  they got the tumor repaired her heart but she bled out of her eye  she didnt bleed out of her eye from a heart tumor  true the cardiac tumor was benign thats impossible  statistically oh shut up  if the tumors benign that means it didnt cause her hallucinations  thats why im mentioning it so the tumors a coincidence  this is bad youre starting to state the obvious  no you said it would be there and it was there it cant be a coincidence  a 9yearold with terminal cancer  gets an unrelated benign tumor growing in her heart  why its benign thats impossible  talk to wilson and the retinal bleed another coincidence  a clot could create pressure behind the eye cause the bleeding  a clot could explain the eye but doesnt explain the hallucinations  a clot could cause mini seizures  great another thing thats not causing the hallucinations  foreman postseizure psychosis  the brain sort of corrects itself after the seizure by hallucinating  the clot could explain the eye and the hallucinations  but what about the tumor  tumors the size of an octopus wrapped around a iittle girls heart  are not just a coincidence  shes not healthy shes never been healthy  wilson whats the theory here this girls bodys a iemon  faulty manufacturing everythings falling apart  the tumor is afghanistan the clot is buffalo  does that need more explanation okay  the tumor is aiqaeda the big bad guy the brains  we went in wiped it out but it had already sent out a splinter cell  a small team of iowievel terrorists quietly iiving in some suburb of buffalo  waiting to kill us all  are you trying to say the tumor threw a clot before we removed it  it was an excellent metaphor  angio her brain before this clot straps on an explosive vest  house angio was clean  theres no clot theres a clot we just cant find it  you cant do exploratory surgery on her brain  are you sure youre not a neurologist  sighs  okay  shes gonna die well the clots not gonna go away quietly  it could blow at any time  are you gonna iet them know i guess so  can i come with to tell andie shes gonna die  thats very unyou shes such a brave girl  i wanna see how brave she is when you tell her shes gonna die  go to hell  crying  what would you do if you were told you were gonna die  i dont know id be devastated youd cry iike a baby  everybody would  shes not doing anything shes a rock shes brave  yeah yeah yeah why  shes gone through more than most people do in a iifetime  so what does that mean shes ready to die  what if her bravery is a symptom  the clot is causing hallucinations and messing with her emotions  you think her bravery is chemically based  it would tell us where to iook for the clot wheres the fear center  the amygdala near the hippocampus its a big area and a busy one  you blindly cut in there youii kill her  only time youre gonna see this clot is at autopsy  then iets do that  is it still illegal to perform an autopsy on a iiving person  are you high if its tuesday im wasted  its wednesday  i want to induce a hypothermic cardiac arrest  once the patients on bypass we siphon off two iiters of blood  perfuse the brain while shes in an mri  youre actually talking about killing her  just for a iittle while iii bring her right back  oh well in that case go ahead why are we even talking  if we do nothing shes dead in a day maybe a week  the kind that iasts  we need fda approval for any surgical technique  thats used for diagnostic purposes absolutely  if we were doing anything invasive but theres nothing invasive  you know im not cutting into her head im just iooking for a clot  not invasive youre killing her  dont split hairs if it works she iives  sighs  make sure the mom understands that this is a milliontoone shot  iii see that wilson passes that along  the plan is  basically to reboot your daughter  like a computer we shut her down then restart her  how do you restart a 9yearold girl  we cool her core body temperature to 21 degree celsius  use blankets ice sort of iike hibernation  not quite in hibernation a bears heartbeat is just very slow  in cardiac arrest there is no heartbeat so shes dead  temporarily yes  by cooling her we iimit the risk of damage when we remove her blood  not all of it two to three iiters half her blood  then we put it back its called perfusing the circuit  in this case her brain  and using an mri wed have a very brief window  to hopefully see the outline of the clot  if its there and its operable we go get it  and andie walks out of here  door opening  sighs  signed consent forms great thanks  you sound better  i stacked a combo of mentholatum a few vicodin  and something else which i cant remember  should be able to ride the high for a couple hours  what did andie say about what  about this i didnt talk to her  she doesnt need to know the specifics of this procedure  what if youre right about her  what if she just is that brave  that doesnt mean shes mature enough to handle this kind of decision  either she understands or shes not brave you cant have it both ways  if she does understand  then she deserves to know whats going on  monitor beeping  im dr house ive seen you around  your mom tell you what were gonna try sort of  tomorrows test could take 10 hours  given your present condition you might not even make it through  my moms done a iot of research how do you feel about it  if we figured maturity came from how much time youve got ieft  instead of how iong youve been here this would be your call  i dont have a choice right  i could give you one  i wanna get better  youve got cancer  if i fix this i have a year  a year of this  a iot of people wouldnt want that  a iot of people would just want it to be over  are you asking if i wanna die  nobody wants to die  but youre going to  the question is how how much youre gonna suffer and  how iong  im asking if you want this to be over  what would you tell my mom  i would give her  why we cant do this procedure  i cant just ieave her cause im tired  but you cant stay for her either  but she needs me here  this is your iife  you cant do this just for her  i iove her  thank you for joining me for tonights dress rehearsal  piaying the part of andie is morty randolph  for his donation to science we give our thanks  once andie is cooled and goes off bypass  we have 60 seconds to get two iiters of blood out of her body  back into her for the pictures to find the clot in her head  if our star is bumped tomorrow  shrill beeping while my mri is on these red iights will go off  which will mean we have no usable test results  no test results its goodbye broadway  you guysii be wearing bad cat suits in des moines  weii have neurosurgeons here with a view of the monitors  cardiac surgeon there in case we need to open her up  anesthesiologists one by the cardiac bypass machine  one by the cooling apparatus  girls in the chorus if youre over 510 stick with me  okay give me 60 seconds on the clock  show time a five six seven eight  house siphon off the blood through the arterial iine  whoosh  sound of blood draining more whoosh  gulping  shrill beeping and we kill her  again  beeping  male technician sorry my hand slipped how hard can this be  its a iittle busy down here again  beeping  anesthesiologist if we didnt have to iavage her gastrointestinal  again  again  we could bolt it to the table  gruesome and iowtech kiss me i iove it  a five six seven eight  female technician here you go doctor  thisii make you sleep  a iot of people big musical number kiddo  a iot of people

thereii be permanent damage  keep iooking  there  i didnt see anything it was there  you sure  four millimeters iateral to the hippocampus i saw it  neurosurgeon 2 house shes out of time shes gonna be a vegetable  i saw it  thats good enough for me  they were able to restart her heart shes doing as well as could be hoped  pam so they found the clot we think so  the neurosurgeons are attempting to remove it right now  and when will we know if there was any damage  a few hours  crying  in the deep playing  four millimeters iateral to the hippocampus  thats where i am theres nothing there  youre not there yet keep going im there  are you sure you saw there it is  i think i can get it  hi mom  oh hi  door opening  youre treating your stuffy nose with cocaine  diphenhydramine antihistamine  new

couple more rocks andies going home  right  the parade of the small bald circus freaks  sorry ive got a thing i read her surgeons report  oh the clot was nowhere near her amygdala  means her fear emotions were working perfectly  yeah yeah  so her bravery was not a symptom  yeah i was wrong  she genuinely is a selfsacrificing saint  whose iife will bring her nothing but pain  which she will stoically withstand  just so that her mom doesnt have to cry quite so soon  im beside myself with joy  house sniffing  exclaiming  she enjoys iife more than you do right  she stole that kiss from
