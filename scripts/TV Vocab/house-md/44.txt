obviously breathing now  continue the blowby stat portable chest   caucasian female 32  where am i  tonicclonic seizure in the bathroom  where am i  come on one two three  where am i  on three one two

had a seizure before  no  i cant mve my head i want to see him  hes right here honey hes right here  tonight  l word marathon  you watch the l word  on mute  ill pass  dinner with cuddy  still sucking up so shell fund your play space for the chemo kids  they really ought to save their energy for other things like crying    shes the suckup  she asked you  shes smart she knows if she buys me enough alcohol  my defenses just might be weakened  doesnt make sense unless she ran out of batteries  hey im recently single shes single  youre too nice for her to like you  shes not needy enough for you to like her  shes got an agenda just not one that includes an appearance by little jimmy  ill poll my peeps  how many of you think that cuddy asked  or rather peep  chase caught a case in the er he wants us to take a look  unless chase broke his neck falling off his polo pony he had no reason to be in the er  cuddy put him on a twoweek nicu rotation  patient had an unexplained seizure  seizures are cool to watch boring to diagnose  how about foreman  he needs to get his malingering butt back here  he almost died  almost being the operative word  hey  how are you doing you look great  thanks i feel great  glad youre back  cameron makes lousy coffee  i take mine black the way i take my braindamaged neurologists  happy to help  how you coming along  tell  her everythings great  neither of us wants to deal with her guilt   i dont feel guilty  of course not  hell if people felt guilt every time they accidentally lobotomized a guy   i was trying to save his life  yeah  your heart was in the right place  its just his brain is not quite where its supposed to be  tell her everythings great  its true  no  more leftside rightside reversals  still some shortterm memory loss and spatial processing problems but  trying not to be too hard on myself  yeah might pull a muscle  we have a case  seizure that cant be explained by epilepsy  and accompanied by elevated calcium levels  still bored  tell her why  because seizure with mildly elevated calcium is diagnostically simple  its either hyperparathyroid cancer or calciummediated neurotoxicity  well done  but until you can remember how to make coffee hands off the patients  h ouse  all those reasons this case bores you  the er has already ruled them out  lungs are clear get an eeg confirming brain functions okay  can we focus on the task at hand  why did mommy twitch so hard that she tossed the baby in with the bathwater  you dont need me for this  of course i need you were a team  polyarteritis nodosa  inflamed arteries in the brain cause seizures  inflamed arteries in the kidneys cause calcium buildup  youre a moron  did you even look at the file kidney functions fine   whipples  what  whipples  test her  cameron thinks it starts with a w  im thinking v  dad vomited this morning maybe theyve both got strep  think you can do a strep throat culture without the swab ending up in the guys poop chute   v for vasoconstriction  it got to be my guess  excess calcium makes blood vessels in the brain clamp down  bestcase scenario seizure worstcase stroke  do a digital extraction angiogram  foreman cant tell up from down camerons a girl   all that mechanical stuff  sorry cuddy says im stuck here  youre late  and you are in my locked office  again  whatcha got there  special panties for your date with wilson  its not a date and its none of your business  if its not a date it is business  and if it was business you wouldnt say it was none of my business  what do you want  i wanna talk about your date with wilson   its not a date  this is fun  spring chase from nicu and ill shut up about your date  nicu is shortstaffed  you suddenly lost the ability to lie  nobodys quit nicu in two years  and if youre making up reasons that means there is no reason  which means he asked for the assignment didnt he  if chase needs a break from you he should take it  absolutely  both mom and dad are negative for strep  youll be back playing with the big toys soon  or not either way im fine  you dont have to say that  its okay  i can always work in a research lab or teach  and youd be okay with that  why wouldnt i be  you were planning on pursuing grants of your own  running a department  im alive  changing jobs not making coffee  if that stuff bothers me now i dont deserve the second chance  ungaa  they say that physical contact helps the healing process    whats happening  your sons not getting enough oxygen take mr mason outside  uhh uh ahh uhh  lungs collapsed hes not getting any air i need an iv catheter  uh  aah aahh  you have a seizure  her chest muscles are contracting its something else  aah  her whole back is spasming i need 2 milligrams lorazepam stat  hes okay  his lung wouldnt collapse if he was okay  what is happening  i have no idea  aah aah  house sowhat causes seizures hypercalcemia  and the thing where mommy bends like gumby  little busy here  uhoh  babys lungs are gonna conk out any minute  probably wanna deal with that  ill get right on it as soon as i finish indulging my boss  multitask  chemical pneumonitis  bubble bath got into the babys lungs when he was underwater  start him on prednisone  keep him on high fi02  let the indulging commence  lithium could cause all three of the mothers symptoms  no record shes on lithium  and tox screen was negative  lithium doesnt show on a basic tox screen scarecrow  myelomatous meningitis could also cover everything  rare complications of a rare blood cancer  youre not totally hopeless  get an spep and an mri for myelomatous meningitis  search the patients place for lithium  babys lung problem is bacterial not chemical start ecmo  while youre searching for the lithium take a water sample and check the pipes  you want me to write this down for you  i ask you is almost dying any excuse for not being fun  im not putting that baby on ecmo  the chance of there being bacteria in bathwater  why dont you wanna work for me  im nice and fun at parties  im not working nicu because of you  the babys xray suggested chemical pneumonitis  not to me  xray was too consolidated  so why are you down here  hoping to expand your makeout pool to include the preemie to nineyearold demographic  i needed a break  from the patients  they lie to us all the time  foreman almost died trying to save a drugdealing cop  i just wanted to get away from that for a while  what a complete load of crap  what am i a nurse youre trying to prep with this vulnerability thing  ecmo could kill him  you dont start him on ecmo and that infection could rampage through his body like pistons fans after a championship    but you do it your way  nothing more honest than a dead baby  ecmo stands for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation  basically we remove your sons blood  all of his blood  we run it through a machine which takes out carbon dioxide and adds oxygen  then we rewarm the blood and run it back into his body  there is a significant risk of internal hemorrhaging and he may also suffer  you put him on antibiotics wont that take care of the infection  not fast enough  are you sure this is mikeys best shot  absolutely   cuddys trash  not anymore  paid good money for it  look at what she bought  red clover  what is red clover used for dr wilson  its also used to treat asthma  psoriasis joint pain  she doesnt wheeze flake or ache  and she didnt ask a pulmonologist or a dermatologist for dinner  she invited an oncologist  its not a date  its a consult  moms mri was negative for masses abscesses   theres no sign she has  fascinating  call me when we have  she has a subarachnoid bleed  so why is our patient bleeding into her brain  her blood workup shows her protimes elevated  shes bleeding because shes not clotting so why is she not clotting  whatd you bring us daddy  only moodaltering drug was vodka the back of a drawer  hiding booze is classic alcoholic behavior thatd explain the bleeding  what bleeding  you dont remember  she  bled all over you this morning  kidding idiots are fun no wonder every village wants one  if shes an alcoholic she would also be more prone to hypercalcemia  but the tox screen was negative for alcohol  hey it was your idea  now its even better  mommy quits she gets the dts even explains the seizure  also fits conversion disorder  theyre deep in debt hes working round the clock they got a new baby  i think the seizure was a physical response to psychological stress  boozy mommy covers more symptoms  put her in a nice phenobarbital coma before the dts kill her  where are you going  to put her in a pheno coma  what if im wrong what if daddys the drunk  you want us to give her the pheno or not  i want him to argue his point  i assumed you considered the father and ruled him out  whats that saying  when you asssume you become a pain in the ass to me  why should i argue youd just overrule me  enough get a pony or a watermelon farm  house  i  need him to react i need him to act like a human being  i need him to get over this boring neardeath rebirth  i have changed its not something you get over  nearly dying changes everything forever  for about two months two months is too long  i need the guy i hired back now  now matter how much your misery loves company  its not getting mine  ill talk to the dad cameron can take the mom well figure out if mom was a drinker  waste of time  put her in a coma before the dts kill her  so  is this a separation or  well lawyers have been hired friends divvied up  oddly she didnt fight me for house   at least there arent kids involved  you just have each other to deal with  hmm  if there had been kids maybe we would have done more of that  do you want kids  listen is there anything in particular you wanted to  hospital business or  catching up  i mean you know its not like  either one of us has anybody to run home to  no  how are you feeling  okay  a little groggy  theres  somebody here to see you  hey mikey mommys awake  oh mikey  oh gosh i was so scared  oh  oh i love you  i love you so much ohh shh  im sorry  you dont have anything to be sorry about  you were sick  turns out she and her husband met in aa  obviously she slipped good call  it wasnt hard considering my other choice was your stupid psych theory  which was not stupid  i tell you im gonna drop the nbomb if i have to  youre addicted to conflict  did they change the name  you could have handled this patient without dragging chase in  but that fact that he didnt want in killed you  just like the fact you cant get a rise out of me  wheres the baby  get off me  no i have to do this  no breath sounds crash cart and epi stat  uhh uhh  told you your psych theory wasnt stupid  your son is stable  but the lack of oxygen damaged his kidneys  she must have rolled over on him by mistake  mr mason  i was there  your wife tried to smother your son  thats impossible  kara would never hurt mikey  he knows  they said mikey knows  you hear voices  they wouldnt quit saying that mikey would be better off if  they were right  weve been trying to diagnose a seizure that didnt exist  she faked it when her husband caught her  i dont think she faked it  she just happened to seize right in the middle of drowning her child  good break for the kid  hey take it easy on foreman  hes playing with one lobe tied behind his back  postpartum psychosis makes her want to drown her kid  the internal conflict triggers a seizure  you know what else might be a trigger  physical illness its a wild idea i know  especially since she doesnt have any obviously physical symptoms like internal bleeding or excess calcium  ill draw some blood test for a  uhh jeez youve done it again will you argue with me  drinkers dont eat right  explains the bleeding and the calcium this might just be some crazy drunk  and im telling you that shes about to die of myelomatous meningitis   we already tested for  exactly its an insane idea  okay what do you want me to do  have an original thought  in the meantime stress her into having another seizure  we cant shes on haloperidol  you also cant because its dangerous and highly unethical  therefore if you get caught pretend you cant make coffee  mental defectives get tons of slack  take off the haloperidol hook her up to an eeg  flash some lights make her pant shoot her up with a placebo  when she starts twitching if the machine twitches along its real  if not call the cops cause shes a psycho killer   stop pushing him  stop protecting him  he needs it   not if he wants to get better  he might not be able to get better  well then i need a new neurologist  he got sick doing his job  if he got killed doing his job i wouldnt keep him on the payroll  i dont care how guilty you feel or how touched you are by his reborn spirit   im not touched  then youre guiltridden   im not guiltridden  then youre pathetic  right now im annoyed  keeping him up all night in a seizure lab is not the way to advance his recovery   its too much  youre right  you should stick around make sure he doesnt screw up  foreman kara look directly into the light  keep looking  thought youd be gone for the day  thought id wait for the bone marrow biopsy results  house sent you to babysit me didnt he  he asked me to wait for the results   oh cameron its fine  of course it is  look a few weeks ago you were upset that i didnt consider you a friend  now youre upset that im happy  what can i say apparently im a bitch   i didnt say that  its annoying  insisting every day of your life is a blessing is basically calling everyone else shallow   it gets old  sorry  oh give it a rest  how was dinner  cuddy did not mention cancer  she lost her nerve  it was a date  what are you doing  pcr test  youre doing it yourself in the middle of the night  on a spoon  cuddys spoon  im checking her saliva for cancer markers  yeah  i do that after all my dates too  people think youre the nice one  why are you so worried about cuddy  you go first  you desperately want this to be a date  because the alternative is cancer  just admit that you like her  shes smart funny  got a zesty bod  its great you can look beyond the fact shes the devil  i stole a spoon you stole her garbage  shes my boss  she gets sick the hospital might replace her  especially if she dies  id have to learn how to manipulate someone new  whoa  i think im gonna cry  find me when the results come in  mr mason  because of the damage done to your sons kidneys his potassium is climbing  its causing irregular heartbeats  im doubling the meds and starting him on dialysis  unless we get his potassium down  hes gonna have a heart attack  kara just another few minutes  biopsys back shes negative for myelomatous meningitis  and shes not seizing  so were wrong and house is wrong  and youre okay with that   shes seizing  shes not doing anything  brain activity isnt accelerating its slowing down  cameron muscle rigidity involuntary grasping and sucking motions  shes in an encephalopathic delirium  mmm a genuine physiological illness  that rules outa few things  like what i wonder  postpartum psychosisand conversion disorder  thing about being a good loser youre still a loser  ouch  the delirium means her brain is shutting down reverting to its most instinctual functions  since its progressing maybe we can assume its progressive  which means it wont be long before the brain closes shop altogether  ideas    hes in v fib  potassiums still too high  no pulse get him off the machine  charge at 10  clear  still in v fib  another amp of epi  damn it chase shouldnt be wasting his time in nicu  could be wernickes  no treatment for wernickes is thiamine we gave her that together with the pheno  delirium points to lithium i know we didnt find any but  shes have to be smuggling it in to be getting sicker  whipples causes encephalopathic delirium  test was negative  the test could have been wrong  ideas are not soda cans  recycling sucks  we need something new and shiny  or go retro take an old idea shine it up add a new symptom  encephalopathic delirium  pellagra  she drinks alcoholics get pellagra  they eat lousy diets so no niacin  he agrees with me what a shock  well youre right lack of niacin starves the brain  neurons shut down causes seizures encephalopathic delirium and psychosis  we give kara niacin shell come out of her delirium and shell be totally sane  dont think shes ever gonna be sane again  her son just died  how do you feel  um  my stomach kind of hurts  i need to ask you some questions see how youre doing  mmhmm  tell me your name  kara mason  is my son here  when were you born  please wheres michael is he okay  do you hear any other voices besides mine  no answer me  youve been suffering from delusions  they were caused by a vitamin deficiency pellagra  it made you believe things that were not real  like the voices  i uh  remember doing things to mikey  were those real  im afraid so  so i  you tried to suffocate your son  but i  you you stopped me  and uh  that other doctor he got mikey breathing  your sons organs were damaged too severely  he passed away this morning  oh no no no no no no  no  oh my god no oh my god  foreman pellagra doesnt cause bloody vomit  shes still sick and getting worse  house so what causes pellagra and crimson spew  whack  dead baby while sad not our problem  i should have given him more polystyrene  you killed him  if you dont get over it youre gonna kill mama too  cameron her alcoholism caused the pellagra maybe it also explains the vomiting   gastritis  gastritis meds arent helping  which may confirm her story she only slipped once  you remove the drinking from the equation internal bleeding hypercalcemia seizure and pellagra are all back in  chase will you get your head out of the dead babys butt and focus on the barely alive  how much polystyrene did you give the kid   his potassium just kept rising  i need your son  who are you  your wifes doctor  your son may have had the same condition she does  my son didnt have a condition  she killed him  if i biopsy her intestine shell bleed out  he obviously wont  youre not using my sons body to help her  okay how about trading him for a beer  or maybe youre more of a whisky guy  you didnt have strep or a stomach bug the morning you came in  you puked because you were hung over  accuse a recovered drunkof slipping most of the time youd be right  so i drink  youre acting like this is my fault  people are gonna feel sorry for you  theyll tell you that you cant anticipate the unthinkable the fact is you can  its just not all that pleasant  you dont know anything about  i know that people dont get crazy enough to kill someone  without first being crazy enough for someone to notice  how many times did you go out for a drink because she was crying  how many times did you stay at work because  you couldnt listen to her telling you what a bad mother she is  you were relieved when she shut down  just sat staring for hours at a time  she held the pillow over his head you slept while she went nuts   not exactly a draw but  what is wrong with you  what kind of a person says those things now  let me do the test  itll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about  got a dead baby for you to biopsy  let cameron do it  you love working nicu  i could get you transferred  i told you i just wanted to trust patients  you dont give a crap about patients  your paycheck  youve been doubledipping  taking your vacation time here while drawing a salary in nicu  strange rich boy doing all that for some extra cash  im not rich  but your dad was  now hes dead  if youre not rich that means that daddy cut you out  im not rich  dont let it change you  and do the test  over yonder by the american boy choir  god of confession take michael into your arms  welcome him into paradise  where therell be no sorrow no weeping and no pain  peace and joy forever more  im sorry  it was a date  cuddys negative for all cancer markers  it was a date  babys intestines shows light villous atrophy  why would a baby have flattened villi  he was being treated with polystyrene   polystyrene shouldnt  it didnt  question is what did they use in the nicu to bind it together   wheat gluten  thats great stuff  unless your body cant tolerate it  the baby didnt have colic he had celiac disease  just like mom  celiac can be triggered by all kinds of stress  bills childbirth drunk husband  every time she had a bowl of pasta or a slice of bread or a slosh of soy sauce  her small intestine became more damaged  less able to absorb the vitamins and minerals into her bloodstream  her body couldnt absorb enough niacin caused the pellagra  couldnt absorb vitamin k caused the bleeding  and celiac is why the babys meds didnt work  his body just couldnt absorb them  switch mom to iv nutrition  its glutenfree itll spruce her villi right up  no celiac causes nutritional deprivation our patient has excess calcium  tell them what causes excess calcium  with a chaser of bloody vomit  celiac patients are susceptible to cancer of the stomach lining   she has malt lymphoma  well shes your patient now  and it wasnt a date  you dont have cancer  you dont have dwarfism  you have no proof of that  i on the other hand have this  you ran a pcr on me without my consent  hey its good news  really its just hard to access because of this overwhelming sense of personal violation  deal with it on your own time  bad news  estrogen is too high  no matter how many people you tell otherwise  i am and always have been a woman estrogen is normal  not this much  not for at least another week  thats when you ovulate  what  you monitor my periods  based on when i get bitchy or  once a month when you leave the kidscancer ward your eyes glisten  and about three days later you break your ban on sugar and  chow down a bucket of frozen yogurt in the cafeteria sprinkles included  based on the last yogurt sighting youve got another week before you ovulate  youre on fertility meds  with red clover as an herbal booster  and that dinner with wilsonw as an audition  its too bad he didnt land the gig he would have had fun  i was considering a donation  not a party  so  when is our dinner  ooh hes gonna be so disappointed  right you two are gonna have a lot of fun with this  your patient wont let me touch her  i killed my son  is it my turn to say something obvious now  oh i know you were insane  i did it i chose to do it  yeah like diabetics choose to not produce insulin  listen someone got sick someone died  it happens every day  the only difference in this case is it wasnt the same someone  i could have stopped  i didnt have to listen to those voices  spoken like a true sane person  this is not your fault  youre healthy now  except for the cancer  those voices felt as real to me as as michaels hand  right here when he nursed  and the smell of his hair  you do not deserve to die  maybe  i dont wanna live  she said no  so we gether declared unstable appoint a medical proxy  she was unstable now shes sane  shes entitled to refuse the treatment  you have to change her mind you cant just walk away  fine go on in there and tell her that every day is a blessing  so you killed your baby shake it off think positive at least youre alive  hmm  kind of hard to sell when you dont believe it huh  and you never believed it  you just wanted all that crap you went through to mean something  well it didnt mean anything it never does  welcome back  why are you doing this to me i was happy  you were aspiring to be content  dont give mea semantic argument i was content with the way things were  thats what happiness is  yeah if we were all just satisfied with what we had what a beautiful world it would be  wed all slowly starve to death in our own filth but at least wed be happy  listen i need your selfworth to hang on this job  for kicking ass here to be all that lets you rise above miserable  if waking up in the morning is enough i dont need you  i can live with that  no you cant not anymore  if you got treatment then maybe we could  when you see mikey  tell him his dad says hes sorry  hi   night  night  good night  did you tell cuddy we tested her for cancer  yeah  and  it wasnt a date  turned out she had some skin lesions  guess there was no genetic predisposition  you tivo the l word
