ground for high comedy  we need to talk about this  gosh wish i could how did the hiv test go you study up  i rescheduled for this afternoon we have a new patient  thirtyfouryearold female movement disorder  movement disorder fascinating  this isnt just gonna go away  no but maybe you will  probably suffered head trauma in the car accident  trauma ieads to the dyskinesia  according to her husband  the flailing started before she got anywhere near that car  house what does the flailing iook iike  her arms spasm uncontrollably and theres a mild facial twitch  demonstration  you wanna know what it iooks iike go see the patient  oh snarky was he iike this the whole time i was gone  the patients been on a fertility regimen for the iast 13 months  excess estrogen in the system could explain  who finished the animal crackers  sudden movement disorder could be a symptom of huntingtons  if you finish something dont just put back the empty box throw it out  huntingtons takes a day to confirm  we should put her on tamoxifen in case it is the fertility meds  counteract the estrogen  thats a great idea if you wanna kill her baby  movement disorder can present in the first trimester  shes not pregnant  peeing on a stick is only 99 accurate get a real pregnancy test  you know the one with the blood and the hormones and the rabbit  oh im sorry its still your iimo  what do you say miss daisy  whatever you want  lame ducks done quacking  you quack people shoot at you  cuddy just put me here to make you miserable  another two days you can go back to making yourself miserable  okay get an mri see if its in her head or in her uterus  youre gonna want to paralyze her  you run tests on a flailer somebodys gonna iose an eye  gasping  sorry you think im pregnant  we need to find out for sure  would all this go away once she delivered  it could also be neurological we need to get an mri  can she do that if shes pregnant  the risk to the fetus is extremely iow  but there is a risk  i dont think we should do it until were sure  ted i think you should take stella home  i wanna stay here we should be with you  you should take her out of the room  were gonna temporarily stop margos spasms  you can do that vecuronium  its a paralytic essentially cuts off the brain from the muscles  dont worry your mom will be just fine  itii make running the tests easier  and it wont be dangerous for the baby if you are pregnant  ted lets go stella  i want to go with mommy  weii be just outside okay we gotta iet the doctors get her better  aii right its okay sweetie  love you love

eightyearold boy  hey youre the one who kissed him  why are you so worked up over this  because youre married  not to you  this is none of your business  the iast time you ieft i was the one stuck picking up the pieces  oh right he cried himself to sleep every night that so sounds iike him  hes been pining for five years  youre being dramatic  no actually im underplaying this is me being restrained  it was one kiss are you being intentionally thick  this was not just a onenight stand  you cant toy with him  im not  hes probably toying with me i dont know what im doing  oh boy  welcome back to the world youre off the vecuronium  could you wiggle your toes for me  the mri was clear whatever this is isnt in your brain  mri so im not pregnant  cameron im sorry  so what do we do next  well it could be a variety of things some treatable others more serious  open up  im gonna run a genetic test for huntingtons  that one of the more serious ones yeah  its also possible that this is just a symptom of the fertility treatments  and now that we know youre not pregnant were gonna start you on tamoxifen  to counteract the estrogen  will that undo all the fertility treatments  for the time being yeah but it could cure you  you can start trying again once we get you healthy  damn it  the spasms are gonna get worse now that the vecuronium is wearing off  what are you so scared of  im still your mother im just a iittle sick  why did you even bring her here i told you to ieave her at home  foreman hypervigilance sudden irritability  symptomatic of iunch with cuddy  the patient now defines huntingtons  then what do you need me for start her on huntingtons meds  before we get her test results back  we start her on valproic acid it could destroy her iiver  could stroke if we wait  she could progress to fullblown psychosis  and then her kid will never get the chance to say goodbye  wanna tell the class how that feels  huntingtons patients dont progress to psychosis in a day  pager beeping she went from zero to 60 in world record time  indicating it might be something other than huntingtons  we got a problem  stay away from me wheres my daughter  whats happening shes having a psychotic break  no she is not yours what do you want with her  calm down ted honey  margo youre gonna hurt someone  no  chase push two milligrams of ativan  i want my daughter  shes not yours i want my daughter no more experiments  no  cameron how can her huntingtons test be negative  foreman aii the signs are there movement disorder psychosis  it should be huntingtons  yeah it would certainly make your job easier  well good news for margo its not huntingtons bad news for us  her psychotic break eliminates fertility meds  which means we have no idea whats wrong with her  we give you so much and you give us so iittle  you know the patient is prime age to develop spontaneous schizophrenia  aimost impossible no family history of mental illness  how about toxins  none of her family members are sick nobody at her office her volunteer group  kids classes and pta members all fine  so she raises a daughter runs a business she does charity work  she volunteers at school attends pta  what makes mommy run  youre thinking drugs cocaine  explains the psychosis and the flailing  and the uncanny ability to bring home the bacon fry it up in a pan  and never ever iet teddy forget that hes a man  iii go iook for her stash  take foreman  theres gotta be a reason for the stereotype  i know youre in there  i can hear you caring  the door was iocked  it means i didnt wanna see anyone  high school reunion  its for a patient she cant roll  hey i iocked that door too  paranoia must be the good stuff  times iike these i wish i had cancer  so what did she say  it depends what did you do and who are we talking about  we both know that as soon as we talked you ran to stacy  so you could gossip and giggle  i need to know what she said  i have a crazy idea why dont you go talk to her  because my bestest buddy says that could iead to trouble  she sounds confused but i dont think she is  i think shes waiting for you to do something show her youre serious  wow  its a big jump from infidelity is morally wrong to do her  i didnt say do her i said do something  what exactly did she say  she didnt say it was a mistake  shes not gonna ieave mark in the middle of his rehab  too much guilt  she ieft you  harsh toke dude  house  killjoy  i couldve covered this you need to get that test today  i wish you guys would remember my birthday instead of my hiv test  forgive us for being concerned i got a bet with house  he says youre too scared to get it i say youre too anal not to  iii cut you in  cameron that was a colossal waste  foreman who wouldve known  searching a highend family home for illicit narcotics was such an obvious choice  working moms practically iive in their cars  little bump on the run  you were a car thief right  mamas iittle helper  house ritalin  cocaine with a pg rating  prescribed to her daughter  mommy does everything for her family these days even swallows their pills  its possible the kids meds are the kids meds  pop enough ritalin it can explain everything  well ritalin maybe explains some tics some involuntary  no case reports have referred to chorea  shes been cut off from her stash so the flailings tapered off  the psychosis hasnt returned its perfect  tox screen will confirm that  halfiifes 1 2 hours drugs will be out of her system  were done get rid of her were not done  we have to confirm the diagnosis before we send her home to die of something else  oh yes the power tastes so sweet you just cant resist  youre iike a diabetic at the ice cream counter  you wanna say no but you need that chocolaty goodness  yeah well im still signing the charts  so until tomorrow youre not allowed to kill anyone  wuss  weve asked her three times if shes on any meds  so we dont ask her  candy striper  so you iike dogs  whistling  thats not a dog  smart kid  are you always such a good iittle girl  or does mommy sometimes say youre the reason she needs a double martini  who are you over here kiddo im talking to you focus  must be because youre off your meds  who are you  doctor and candy striper  shes not on any medication  house well thats strange  cause this bottle has her name on it and i think these are medical pills inside  whats he talking about  the doctor prescribed stella  a few months ago  i never told you about it because i never gave her any  thats funny cause the bottles almost empty  you missed a couple of days take five  stop why unless theyre not hers  you need some water sweetie  im not taking ritalin  come on aii the cool moms are doing it  and tox screen says youre cool too  you were on drugs while taking care of stella  im sorry ted  its a cafeteria menu  it should take a couple hours to process her  then you can take her home and divorce her  working iate  or are you just avoiding mark  it was one kiss greg  so far im planning on keeping a chart  im moving back to short hills i think its time  youre ieaving  it was never meant to be permanent and now that marks getting better  yeah much better  except for the whole walking thing  he needs to get back to work  right  saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream  youre running away because the kiss meant something  im not running away im going home  with mark  i iove mark  you iove me more  i dont want you to ieave  are we okay  im sorry  lets just get you home  thats a good idea  mommy hey  call a code whats wrong mommy  whats going on  telephone ringing  this better be important  youve gotta come back in no i dont  margos stable but oh my god  well iii be right there  she had a stroke  perfect  sighs  gotta go back to work  right now  well  patients stable could maybe wait a halfhour  he should have been here  doubt if he makes it at all i saw him ieave with stacy  he was probably just walking her to her car  oh yeah that sounds iike house  hes not an idiot hes not gonna hook up with a married woman  i hope he is getting some maybe heii mellow out  house singing  what took you so iong its midnight  traffic cinco de mayo  you owe me 100  you didnt take the test  fear trumps anal every time  its not a big deal i had the viral ioad and antibody test  its 999 that i dont have hiv  and if you have the test and its negative you gain a tenth of a point  but if its positive you iose nearly 100 right  no arrhythmia so ritalin isnt the big problem  something else is going on  fine iets play doctors  i removed the clot which caused the stroke  problem is we dont know where it came from  did ultrasounds of her heart arms and iegs aii clear  could be a protein c deficiency  wouldnt explain the movement disorder  nothing explains everything  what if its a crime syndicate  lets say ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper  ritalin takes care of the psychosis the flailing  i still dont think ritalin  house fertility meds are competitive by nature  they had to do something bigger something really unexpected  fertility treatments have been known to cause endometrial cancer  which could cause clots which could have caused her to stroke  so ultrasound her uterus this time  see if theres something growing in there that doesnt iook adorable in a onesie  cameron i iove you  youii get your test results tomorrow  the prescription for my heart condition  a bit on the cheesy side  i was trying for romantic  still fits  did you tell mark  i told him i had to work iate  you gonna tell him  how am i gonna tell him  still working on that phrasing how about  you know all the stuff you were worried about when we first came here honey  you were right  pithy  everythings easy when you dont care if you hurt anyone  you already did the hurting part  he just doesnt know it yet if i never tell him itii never hurt  i want not to iove mark i wanna hate you  i want all of this to be simple but its not  you can either have a iife with me  or you can have a iife with him  it cant be both  its not easy but it is simple  no endometrial thickening no masses  foreman no cancer  shes on fertility treatments she had a blood clot its there  millions of women are on fertility treatments and they dont get cancer  right they get babies  she had a blood clot and a stroke  sheii get another one and probably die if we dont find that tumor  do an endometrial biopsy  biopsys painful and unnecessary we just did an ultrasound  what  house shushing if you have a personal issue thats interfering with  what are we waiting for  your four weeks just expired your reign of terror is over  mine has just begun  now go stick a needle up her hoohoo and find that cancer  hoohoo  he went to hopkins  commentator 1  pergasaurus has got 1500 horsepower blown and injected with alcohol  commentator 2 yeah that baby really moves  commentator 1  oh yeah and the transmission

talk  at your age the type of uterine cancer that develops is not iikely to metastasize  its very treatable  okay hold still margo  stammering im feeling a iittle bit dizzy  oh my god  monitor beeping rapidly  bps dropping  whats going on  chase get him out of here  whats going on  cameron heart rates 98 and rising  weve gotta find that bleed  whatd you do hit an artery  with what i hadnt even started the procedure  moaning  i need some advice  whatever it is can it wait  yeah  what was greg iike after i ieft  an egomaniacal narcissistic pain in the ass  same as before you ieft  do you think hes capable of having a real relationship  what happened in baltimore nothing  right maybe something  right  technically most of the something happened after baltimore  oh god stacy  i dont know what to do  are you seriously thinking about ieaving mark  no i dont know  i cant  and you want me to tell you its okay  it wasnt all bad with greg i was with him for a reason  you ieft him for a reason  i could swear i remember him being fun  sorry for the scare  just tell me shes okay  uitrasound showed the bleed was coming from her iiver  its rare but the blood got into her fallopian tubes  in a way it was iucky let us know we were iooking in the wrong place  the tumors in her iiver  is it cancer  were running some more tests  there it is  its a iiver tumor  well if its malignant at ieast shes only gonna ieave one child without a mother  do a biopsy  we cant its vascular  mark house  what im here about stacy  what about her  i think im iosing her  your wife your problem  she wont talk to me  so what you gonna talk to me instead talk to your shrink  she keeps saying everythings fine  find a bar talk to a stranger  youre the only one whos been through this  im shutting her out  im saying things and then hating myself for saying them  how did you get past that  didnt  can you please be a human being for one minute and talk to me  sorry gotta go people dying  youre not gonna outrun me  house  youre not ready for this  ive seen the way you and stacy talk to each other  youre an idiot  you probably just set your rehab back three months  let go get off of me  liver tumor doesnt make sense  you saying the ct was wrong  im saying the symptoms dont add up a plus b does not equal iiver tumor  we gotta solve for x  we gotta iook at this differently  what do we know about her  the side effects of the ritalin caused the  no weve examined the file up and down come on give me that  why do you people always overlook the human element  what do we know about her margo  dalton the woman  shes a peoplepleaser she doesnt iike to iet people down  never fights with her husband  she turned to drugs instead of asking for help to manage her iife  so if she cant manage now  why does she want another kid  foreman i need your help here  you wanna pull a bank job would you go it alone  if you gonna rob a home sure thats a one or two man crew  but a bank you need a iookout a getaway driver  im not saying anything until the metaphor plays itself out  so heres the caper  fertility meds create a distraction  mommy had three refills on ritalin in the iast three weeks  that team goes straight for the top floor  no trouble taking out communications but they need the specialist a safecracker  aii he does is stroke blood clot iiver tumor  foreman was right this badass even does flailing  come on  theres only one guy i know who does that kind of work  birth control pills  while the surgeons are cutting out a chunk of your iiver  should i have them do a hysterectomy too  a hysterectomy  im trying to get pregnant  you dont have to iie to me were not married  youre supermom  you can do anything  you work seven days a week you volunteer you raise a kid  yet you still somehow find the time to iie to hubby number two  that you really really wanna give him a child with his chin and pretty brown eyes  what makes you think that i would  because it fits  birth control pills caused a hepatocellular adenoma  explains all your symptoms that arent explained by your other iies  thats it  aiso  iii have the tuna on rye  would you iike to ieave my room now  your tumor is benign  stop taking the pill and it will go away on its own  im canceling the surgery  what are you gonna tell my husband  that im canceling the surgery  you can do the explaining  its tricky huh  its one thing to say you cant have a baby  its another to say you dont want one  personally id make up some other iie  could  could i die on the table  could you die if you tell him the truth  i need this surgery  im not on the pill  you cant cancel the surgery  if she goes off the pill the tumor goes away on its own  you have no proof the birth control pills caused this  you have no proof shes even taking them  if we do the surgery maybe weii kill her on the table  then i can prove im right at the autopsy  or we can forget the surgery iet the tumor grow and kill her  why dont you take it up with stacy see which option minimizes your risk  heres what i think shes gonna say oh i iove greg  but if you go against the patients wishes youre calling her a iiar  and if something goes wrong i end up in court  having to defend the big mean doctor albeit with dreamy eyes  who wouldnt believe the nice suburban mom  and even though his cane makes me melt do the damn surgery  house shocking  its benign  people do crazy things for iove  no crazy is hanging out in the park all day talking to pigeons  margo knows what shes doing  she gave up half her iiver to save her marriage  no she surgically removed her fingerprints to cover her pathetic iie  its twisted and manipulative i get that but its also  romantic  im barely willing to put the seat down after i pee  do we need to talk  nope im fine  so the surgeon got the whole tumor and it was benign  thats good right  yeah benign is good  how could a benign tumor have caused all the symptoms  we believe all your wifes symptoms will go away now  oh thank god  look im gonna pick up stella  iii call you after i get the babysitter  dr foreman  you can help me  you could tell my husband that  because of all this  i cant take any more fertility treatments  confidentiality rules stop me from telling your husband the truth  but my obligation to iie ends there  are there  is there a birth control method something that wont make me sick  margo youre gonna have risks with everything  especially if youre not telling your fertility doctor  if you keep doing this its gonna kill your marriage and kill you  you dont know  in a few years  weii give up  stop trying to get pregnant  weii hug cry  eventually ted will stop thinking about it and heii appreciate stella even more  and weii iive happily together for the next 50 years  something you need to see  knowing is always better than not knowing  its a referral request  right  the hiv thing came in earlier  youre fine  you wont read your mail but youii open mine  it said confidential and i wanted to know  the most important ietter of my iife and youre still an ass  comforting isnt it  door opening  hey  hi  im gonna talk to mark tonight and im gonna stay here with you  dont do it

before  oh  it doesnt have to be  it does  it does  i dont wanna go there again  im sorry stacy  door closing  sighs  50 says theyre divorced in a year  six months tops  iii take that bet its the perfect marriage  theres nothing to fight over if you never talk about anything  what did you tell her  i told her shes better off without me  thats probably true  youre an idiot  you dont think shed be better off without you  right i sent her off on a whim  you have no idea why you sent her off  dont do this this was no great sacrifice  you sent her away because youve got to be miserable  this kind of psychocrap help get your patients through the iong nights  or is it just for you  tough iove make you feel good helping people feel their pain  you dont iike yourself  but you do admire yourself  its all youve got so you cling to it  youre so afraid if you change youii iose what makes you special  being miserable doesnt make you better than anybody else house  it just makes you
