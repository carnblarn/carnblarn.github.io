underlying cause is   gotta do an mri  youre looking at the wrong part of the scan   im looking at the brain what else is there  the jaw  the jaw tells us why he stroked  no the jaw tells us why we cant do an mri  unless we want his jawbone flying across the room  metal plate hes had major reconstruction and theres no way were removing it  so were forced to be clever  angiogram to rule out vasculitis  emg for peripheral neuropathy tox screen to eliminate drugs  and echo to rule out cardiac emboli  dr cameron id appreciate you keeping the terms of your new contract to yourself  dont want everyone clamoring for the same perks  what perks nothing youd be interested in  so its not money then office space insurance parking  anything he could offer you wed be interested in  he agreed to go

sexually harass my boss  ill arrange for the emg you want to set up the angiogram  and you can get the blood samples patient history patient consent    like watching an accident about to happen  morning  harvey im dr foreman im here to discuss your case  im annette im harveys friend  nice to meet you  i need your next of kin you didnt fill that out on your intake form  harveys parents are

well she can stay you do the talking  whyd you come to the clinic this morning  uh about six months ago i started grinding my  you know in your mouth you chew with them  teeth  harveys experiencing a little nominal aphasia hmm  you know when you cant remember nouns  yeah i think i know what nominal aphasia is  have you had any treatment for the teeth grinding  i went to a  you know they do that thing with the sharp pointy things   needles someone took your blood  no they make you breathe   pulmonologist  no she had this uh  she had this electrical machine  he saw an acupuncturist  mmhmm  do you know what the acupuncturist did  she diagnosed liver chi stagnation and sent harvey to a shen balancer  he referred him to a homeopathic doctor who sent him to a chiropractor  naturally the chiropractor thought it might be food sensitivity and sent harvey to a naturopath  the naturopath sent me back to the   back to the acupuncturist  yes  okay well well need to see the records  of all of those uh practitioners  okay thank you  everything set for the angiogram  camerons got the emg first whos that  harveys guru   thats what she called herself  thats what she acted like  hi im having vaginal pain  pleasure to meet you  my obgyn died recently he was a nice man   warm hands  not anymore  so does it hurt when you tinkle  yeah thats when its worst  you have some vaginal tearing  no sign of bruising  no indication of trauma forced entry  ramona you naughty girl  either youve got yourself an 18yearold boyfriend  or an 80yearold with some little blue pills  myron thought hed just try em out   lucky you   i guess  youd prefer it if myron was a little  droopier maybe a little  we used to hold hands or read together  or watch jeopardy  i havent seen jeopardy in almost a month  have you talked to him about this  you try talking a 73yearold out of sex  with all these male enhancements the pressure to put outs incredible  its worse than high school  he doesnt get what he wants from me hell get it from connie in the corner condo  shes dying her hair red major league slut   heres a prescription  for vaginal estrogen suppositories  itll help with the lubrication  thank you  maybe you could give myron a prescription  something weaker than hes got now  tell him its better for his heart hed buy that  you cant tell him the truth so you want me to lie to him   would you  close your legs    nerves stimulate muscles to move by creating a small electrical current  the machine will measure that  and i will insert this needle into various muscles and ask you to flex  sometimes it can be painful let me know i can pull back  no  i mean its okay  okay put your arm out to the side     you all right  im good  you dont have to stop    raise your arm over your head       the emg was clean   based on this history its either toxic herbs from the homeopath  spinal damage from the chiropractor  infection from a needle that the acupuncturist accidentally let sit in eye of newt  or the shen balancer  what the hell is a shen and how come its lopsided  the only abnormal test result we found was on the echo report  mitral valve prolapse  hang up a shingle and condemn the narrowness and greed of western medicine  you can make a damn fine living  clots form on the faulty valve get sent to the brain voila stroke   of course no harm no foul  just taking a few bucks from superstitious idiots right  could also be an aneurysm due to trauma  trauma from what the chiropractic treatments  its bacterial endocarditis an infected valve we should do blood cultures  the six months that he had with these charlatans  might have been better spent going to someone who looks at things that exist in the real world  but thats just me being all narrow again  i noticed a small bruit when i listened to harveys left carotid  you could hear that if he had an aneurysm from trauma  an aneurysm would have shown on the angiogram  no not necessarily  hmm  quite a dilemma  oh great poolhall oracle grant me guidance  do we go with foremans theory which is at least marginally supported by medical test results  or chases theory that is completely unsupported by medical evidence  what to do  the guy obviously broke his jaw somehow  who knows what other trauma hes suffered we should do the angiogram again  and all signs point to  ah sorry chase the gods have spoken  start harvey on blood thinners and antibiotics  wow yeah i get it house is adorable  i just want to hold him and never let go     my god what the hell are you doing     shes choking him  foreman stop let her go   she was trying to kill him  no no she wasnt  his vitals seem okay please please dont hurt her  what the hell is going on in here   shesshes a dominatrix  right annette   the patient asked you to strangle him  harvey is an asphyxiaphyliac  he likes to be strangled or smothered  thats just sick  well thats an intriguing legal opinion  geez what kind of a lawyer is he   you want a legal opinion call the cops  i was careful  i watched the monitors made sure his o2 sats were over 90 i would never hurt him  then what was the point harvey was upset  he needed to calm down  to feel in control by being controlled    he pays you for this  in return he does my taxes and cleans my house  were not done here we have to talk call the cops  bar her from the hospital force her to pierce your nipples  not really medical decisions   it was a long time ago  i was seeing this woman a banker  and uh turns out she liked to be burned  you actually dated someone who likes to get burned  yeah why would you want to be in a relationship  with someone thats so obviously only gonna lead to pain   shut up   it was a weird scene   i observed  chase did you know about this woman what she does   i met her at some parties yeah  i wouldnt have tortured you if i knew you liked it   well heres a phrase to remember  hey this guy might have been pounded on the head one too many times  i said i thought it was a traumainduced aneurysm yeah could have carried  a tad more weight if youd mentioned the liking pain thing  youre on my naughty list  sorry no leather stethoscope this christmas   im not into  i assume you never started him on antibiotics and blood thinners  before mistress ilsas rude interruption   that was probably a good thing given  start him on antibiotics and blood thinners   you still think chase is wrong  no hes probably right   then we should schedule him for vascular surgery  go into the carotids find the aneurysm repair it  we put him on blood thinners he might bleed out  but if foremans right about it being bacterial endocarditis and we  i think chase is right  okay if foreman used to be right about it being blood clots  and we take the surgery route well probably kill the guy  so start him on blood thinners and if he has another stroke well schedule the surgery   yeah  you dr house  i have a feeling im gonna regret this but yes  ramona said i should come to you for my refill  uh you know the  the woods beginning to droop  she said youd probably want to talk to me first  she lied  here you go  thanks  always happy to make people happy goodbye  uh i dont know how much more of this i can take   much more of what   sex  you dont want more sex  my golf swing is all messed up  hey heres a radical thought talk to her   the truth  sounds crazy when you put it like that  ramonas got a big appetite  if i dont perform   i dont want to lose her  you got a pharmacy around here  in the hospital could be  lets see if we can find it  got any blue pills  you looking for ed medication  well thats one example of a blue pill name six others  theres a brand of acetaminophen  perfect fill er up   dr house  little busy here  i heard about dr camerons conditions for coming back to work  its purely business ill make sure you get the receipt  well i think its a good thing  what happened in your last relationship  its no reason to wall yourself off from people forever  five years of selfpity is probably enough  wow youve certainly given me a lot to think about  if only i was as open as you   well  actually it was your blouse i was talking about  bear in mind camerons probably the only female who could tolerate you  wear the skyblue shirt  it almost makes you look nice  they said she couldnt come back into the hospital  they wont let me see her  harvey youre lucky she wasnt arrested  what were you thinking doing that at a hospital  squeeze my fingers  i was scared ill need you to squeeze with both hands  i am   weakness in his right arm and hand  harveys having ministrokes the blood thinners arent making a difference  stop the treatment  sorry we tried your way you could not have been wronger  i said chase was probably right oh yeah  weve all got perfect  get ahold of may in vascular  see if his surgical dance card is free for tomorrow     about tomorrow night  you couldnt keep your mouth shut  i didnt see any reason to  where are we going i want to make sure i dress appropriately  that would be army boots and tshirt  its the county paint ball tourney first prize is 50 bucks  ill split it with you if you hold your end up  im not sure that was the deal  relax i made a reservation at cafe spoleto  regarding wardrobe  are you too young to remember spandex   ill figure something out  the surgery will repair the damaged blood vessels in your neck  and your strokes will stop  all this is because of the strangulation  more like strangulations  my parents are right   im a loser  i dont i dont know what   i dont know what to do i need to  harvey calm down   i need to talk to annette  you can do this on your own  surgerys the only she hates me  ive been calling ive been calling and she  shes not picking up   harvey you

can we get a cart in here  so whats that two strokes youve scared this guy into  yeah its making me question my view of myself as a people person  now you want to do surgery on him without his consent  the kids in a coma he needs the surgery  he said no we cant do it  emergent situation we invoke heroic measures  you need a court order great where do i get me one of them   do i need to lawyer up  ill need to show the judge an affidavit from next of kin  they might have a problem signing anything seeing as how theyre dead   hell want proof  like what dads hand i dont even know where theyre buried  bring me a published obit or death certificate and well run with it  i dont want you to mess up your clothes   his parents were accountants  maybe theres an obit in the trade papers guy lives in market town  i dont know if he grew up there but we could check the local funeral homes  great and when your searches turn up nothing  you should try and find where they live he said they were dead  accountants are usually pretty good with money  so how come he lives in a slum like market town  maybe they were bad accountants  two bad accountants from the pacific rim  the odds are astronomical maybe harvey burned through their money  or maybe they cut him off when they found out about his proclivities  gotta be my bet go to his apartment see if you can find his folks  number address something  hey can i talk to you  sure  look camerons a friend    this whole dating  times up thanks for playing  hey ive been on the scene more than you recently way ahead of you  i got a case of

nice   oh you know me too well  thats what im saying  i think you should go with your instincts here be a jerk  im missing my soap for this  women love to be right  you gotta leave em feeling superior like they dodged a bullet  but if youre nice shell blame herself  and fall for me even more  the love doctor has made an art out of breaking up with women  cause youre convinced that the loss of you would be too devastating for any woman to handle   yeah im the one with the serious ego problem here  im just saying  some relationships arent meant to happen  harveys school registration  permanent home address emergency contacts  annette rains   mistress annette  you had to extort a date out of house  you dont think thats a bad sign  cameron  high school yearbook  think this might give us a

surgery consent  i have a pen    marilyn park for mark lerner yes ill hold  harveys your son im sure you still care about him  he humiliated us  everybody we know knows about his perversion  but you dont get off on embarrassment the way your son does  my guess maybe it skips a generation  how much money would it take to compensate you  yeah you guys can haggle in a minute but heres the thing  humiliation comes in all kinds of packages  people finding out that your sons a perv  thats pretty high up there  people finding out that youd rather let your son die  than sign a piece of paper  wheres that rank  trust me if i have to paste up a sign  in every nail salon and dumpling shop in pennsylvania ill make sure they know    your son will be in surgery first thing in the morning  dumplings that was a cheap shot  hi are you uh  can we talk  gee i wonder what this is gonna be about  i just want to make sure no one gets hurt  i will be fine everybodys acting like im going out with jack the ripper  oh its not its not you im worried about  its been a long time since he opened up to someone and l  you better be absolutely sure you want this  because if he opens up again and gets hurt  i dont think theres gonna be a next time  youre worried im gonna break his heart  the wide sides too short  youre gonna look like lou costello  this is a mistake  i dont know how to have casual conversation  you think youre talking about one thing  and either you are and its incredibly boring  or youre not because theres a subtext and you need a decoder ring  open doors for her help her with her chair   i have been on a date  not since disco died  comment on her shoes her earrings  and then move on to dha  her dreams hopes and aspirations  trust me panty peeler   and if you need condoms ive got some  did your wife give them to you  drug rep theyve got antibiotics built in somehow  i should cancel  ive got a patient in surgery tomorrow morning  and if you were a surgeon that

very handsome  thank you  ive always loved this restaurant  yeah its changed a lot since the last time i was here  used to be a strip joint    nice earrings  my moms thank you  nice shoes  comfortable  im not expecting you to be someone youre not  were in a restaurant  were dressed up were eating  without small talk what is there    according to freud and im paraphrasing  the instinct of love toward an object demands a mastery to obtain it  and if a person feels they cant control the object or feel threatened by it  they act negatively toward it  like an eighthgrade boy punching a girl  i treat you like garbage so i must really like you  given your freudian theory what does it mean if i start being nice to you  that youre getting in touch with your feelings  mmhmm  so theres absolutely nothing i can do to make you think that i dont like you   sorry no  i have one evening with you one chance  and i dont want to waste it talking about what wines you like  or what movies you hate  i want to know how you feel  about me  you live under the delusion that you can fix everything that isnt perfect  thats why you married a man who was dying of cancer  you dont love you need  and now that your husband is dead  youre looking for your new charity case  thats why youre going out with me  im twice your age  im not greatlooking  im not charming im not even nice  what i am is what you need  im damaged     warm saline     ill get the   came in late good time last night  hows the surgery going harveys doing fine so far   howd the night go  it was fine how was your evening  she had the ravioli i had the puttanesca  yes i really want to know about the quality of the food  either something very good happened or something very bad which is it  well i did have a little indigestion afterwards  maybe it was the garlic bread  or the wine something made my eyes puffy   crying in your pillow can do that  it was the wine  we had a nice candid conversation  nothing deep mostly small talk im sure  took your advice complimented her shoes thats 15 minutes of chat right there   no snide comments  i guesswhen we talked about you guys   just answer one question  you two gonna do dinner again  i dont think so  i dont know  hey kids you were wrong  no aneurysm no nothin this guys clean  which means weve got no idea whats causing the strokes  hes had two more postop  we wont know the extent of the damage  until he comes out of the coma if he comes out  maybe we should go back to the blood thinners up the dosage  if its not clots a loading dose of blood thinners is gonna make him bleed out of his ears  then he wont be able to hear     oy vey   nobody home leave a message  this is important    chase cameron get another angiogram and echo  you better get a full body scan  if it is clots itd be good to know where they are  sorry about that  guy dying  those pills you gave myron theyre not working  well good to see youve got the correct perspective on the thing  well the old ones i mean made me feel like a tree you know  nice visual  but the new ones i might as well be eating candy  candy wouldnt take away your headaches what  you came to me and told me you were having too much sex  i never did you too sequoia   well no thats not true l  i know everybody lies  but youd think that after a certain amount of time together you wouldnt be trying so hard   your rings dont match  why would they  the style is one thing but one silver one gold how long have you guys been married  fiftyfive years fortynine years  damn it youre having an affair  did you really say you wanted to have less sex  well less if i wanted none id stay home with esther  i just need a little rest  you guys arent the victims of the little blue pills youre the problem   im sorry  me too  i should just have told you how i felt  aw  oh welcome to hell    uh hey how about the pills  looks like you guys are good to go drugfree for a while  dr chase these breath mints youve been popping since yesterday  are they a new fetish  i found them at harveys what i just took two boxes   the guys got a whole drawer of them  and you didnt find that interesting  well theres lots of interesting stuff in his place  the mints werent high up on the list  wrong  chase get your nose in here  if youre trying to humiliate me  i told you come on put your face in his mouth     ugh  rich wouldnt you say  mm smells like old vomit  number one sign of fulminating osteomyelitis  infection of the jaw  probably from the original break never healed properly  infected tissue from the jaw  breaks off blocks blood flow to the brain  and life just isnt worth living without blood  it was hidden from the scans by the metal plate  and an infection in the jaw is unlikely to show up in blood tests   so how do we confirm  like this  ladies and gentlemen we have pus  were gonna remove the jaw  anybody got a buzz saw okay call a surgeon      hi im dr house  hows tricks annette  i just wanted to see if he was okay  ill leave  its okay i came to talk to you both  like i tell all my patients  youve simply got to say no to strangulation  me im a freak  i get off on not being in pain  that and chocolatecovered marshmallow bunnies  hes not a freak  yeah he is a little  but its gotta stop  or hell die  its not about pain  its about being open  and completely vulnerable to another person  if you can learn to be that deeply trusting  it changes you  lock him in a cage  that should be fine medically  dr house  were my parents here  did they come to see me           thats some bad hat harry
