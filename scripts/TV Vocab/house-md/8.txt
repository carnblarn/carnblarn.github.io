                  you give me that  what are you talking about   mrs miller  shh your phone young lady   i was just switching it to silent in case someone called  no you were cheating   please like i have to cheat  lady  i said wait  give it here  sure  love the blouse   li need to use the bunk room  the bathroom sure   in 19 minutes  cant do it  you got a friend in the bathroom with the answers    fine ill get you an escort  dont stink up till i kill you  dont stand up   dxdt  hey hes really sick   eyes on your work  are you all right   what is going on  get some help   the kid was just taking his ap calculus exam  when all of a sudden he got nauseous and disoriented  thats the way calculus presents  severe bradycardia heart rates down to 48 and falling fast  you know the kid no he just came in  mom real good looking i didnt notice  then its a mystery  not why hes sick but why you care so much  gift shops open buy him a card hes not responding to atropine  boys love fart jokes find one with a good fart joke  hes a teenager its drugs  tell those er geniuses to give him charcoal and naloxone stop following me  his tox screen was negative hes still whacked out  you dont care about the kid you just find his illness intriguing  his cat scan was clean theres no sign of infection its not diabetes  and you dont care about him  if thats what you wanna hear not in the slightest  me neither may as well be objective  maybe its shigellosis  wouldnt account for the bradycardia  viral myocarditis  wouldnt account for the whacked out   so whats the differential for a negative tox screen  he was clean   unless someone screwed up the test  that never happens  or he odd on something we didnt test for 14butanediol would give you these symptoms   thats a new one  copy machine toner  same punch as ghb a little pricier way more dangerous  on the other hand it is legal i want you to go to his house and find his stash  ill bet you know all the good hiding spots   actually i never did drugs  better go with him in case he gets high   how much atropine is the kid getting  one mi  make it two in case he needs his heart later on   matt did you take any drugs this morning  pencils down  can you squeeze my fingers for me  did anyone give you anything to help with the math test   matt  i told you he doesnt take drugs  ms davis all parents think that about their children  and theyre usually wrong  i gave my mum a little trouble when i was his age  i turned out okay even she thought so  i know my kid the fact that you did drugs doesnt mean he did  did he go anywhere last night  no he was home studying   any friends come over to help him  and bring him drugs  is that what your friends did ms davis  look i tested him myself  the home kit i took some hair off his brush  i didnt want him to know about it because i do trust him  then why did you test him  all he did last night was study and argue about his college interviews  he wants to be himself no haircut ratty old clothes  thatll go over big  then we both gave up and went to bed thats it  has he ever had any problems like this before any family history     no its just me and matt  diazepam ten milligrams stat  right   whats going on  just taking some precautions  hes seizing help me hold him  stay cool mate well calm you down    this room is way too clean for a teenage boy   you know why house thinks im a druggie  this is gonna be a racial thing isnt it  same reason he thinks this kid overdosed when youre a drug addict you wanna believe everyone else is too  hes not addicted he has to take drugs  the definition of an addict  hes in pain and addicted to pain killers  what a coincidence  you really never did any drugs   now this is gonna be a racial thing   deflecting a personal question with a joke gee who do i know that does that  yeah im just like him except for the angry bitter pompous cripple part  maybe we should all pitch in and get you a nice cane  you already have the matching gym shoes  check this out  moms not too careful with the homemade tomato sauce  when the top sticks out like that its a sign of bacterial contamination  this ones open    i am extremely disappointed in you  i send you out for exciting new designer drugs  and you come back with tomato sauce  i bet you paid twice as much i got mine online  matt decided to make himself a homemade pizza for a bedtime snack  source of botulism as well as a million other toxins  that cause gastroenteritis cardiac symptoms and mental confusion  im not so sure about gastroenteritis but mental confusion bring it on   dont but  mmm delicious   do you have a death wish  i notice you didnt try to save me  lfigured you were trying to make some kind of subtle point  i was the kid just started seizing not a symptom of foodborne toxins  also not a symptom of drug use not two hours after admission  so what would make him seize in addition to all these other delightful symptoms   pesticide poisoning  carbamates  or organophosphates organochlorines   inhalation or absorption  too soon to tell  we should wash him down the poison could still be on his skin  already told the nurses   nursing supervisor to the instrument room   i feel good  thats your complaint  your major symptom i told her this was a waste of time  i notice colors more  and music l im really hearing music  im 82 and im supposed to be playing canasta with the other old ladies  but now when i see a guy with a cute butt  i cant stop looking at him  or a sexy beard  and you figure that enjoying cute butts is a sign of disease  it all started a month ago when mark rented gone with the wind for me  but it had the wrong dvd in it  oh oh right li forgot this is all my fault  of course he was too busy to bring it back yeah like i dont have a life  so i watched it and it had this actor in it  this kid called ashton kutcher  now i think about ashton  all the time  all the time   ah  you remind me of him  same bedroom eyes  people are always mixing us up  lli suppose you you need to check my heart   no no no that that wont be necessary  i told you  but i am going to admit you to the hospital for tests  what tests shes just old and youre just insufferable  your mother has had a sudden personality change it should be checked out  ill have a nurse come in and admit her im too handsome to do paperwork        anesthesiologist to or room 4  anesthesiologist to or room 4   hes been on this medication for over an hour  pralidoxime is very effective it just takes a little time for it to kick in  and maybe youre wrong maybe its not a pesticide  the blood work was pretty conclusive its an organophosphate    oh my god  move back ms davis move back please  were at 30 bradycarciac arrest get me the pads     what are you doing  were gonna beat his heart for him set it at 60         i cant stand this anymore  well keep him on the pads for another hour then what  lets see what happens  well thats not my philosophy  especially when it comes to my son  and if something bad might happen id like to know what our options are  the pralidoxime isnt doing him any good were gonna have to wire his heart   maybe were wrong about the pesticides  i ran his plasma again twice  are there any stronger treatments for the organophosphate poisoning  oh damn it you caught me we went with the weak stuff i was just trying to save a little money  actually one of my professors at columbia developed an experimental treatment for the army   whats the success rate  theyre targeted theres a different hydrolase treatment for each poison  wed need to know if matt got hit with orthene or malathion   whats the success rate  excellent im sure its the us army  be all you can be point is what are the kids chances without it  minimal at best the poisons broken the bloodbrain barrier  i assume minimal at best is your stiffupperlip british way of saying no chance in hell   im australian  you put the queen on your money youre british call your professor  if we dont know what kind of organophosphate were targeting  we dont know which hydrolase to ask for   theres over 40 organophosphates  ill get all ofem  get all ofem   great minds think alike  by the time they get here were gonna know which one we need  if we figure out how he got exposed well figure out what he was exposed to  well the mom had homemade tomato sauce  call me crazy but im thinking maybe homemade tomatoes  front yard vegetable garden  kids out there spraying sees a pretty girl  hormones raging spray can goes off in his face   ill check into it  ill make the call  ill keep the kid alive for a while at least  ill have lunch  through the superior vena cava  into the right atrium  through the tricuspid valve  and lodging to the wall of the right ventricle  can you turn off the pad     capturing  getting a native heart rate of 36  no that wont do lets get him to 50    the healer with his magic powers  i could rub his gentle brow for hours  his manly chest his stubbled jaw  everything about him leaves me raw   psych wards upstairs   with joy  oh house your very name will never leave this girl the same  its not bad for an 82yearold she asked me to give that to her true love  what can i say chicks with no teeth turn me on  thats fairly disgusting and thats ageism  you better watch yourself around this babe  here are her test results  impressive    yeah  i found the pesticide its disulfoton  and its empty he used up the whole can okay ill get chase on it  the poisons called disulfoton this should bond with it and neutralize the poison  then his nervous system will start sending the correct signals to the rest of his body  but there was no disul well that stuff in that can  the label says disulfoton i can show you  but you didnt test it  you said matt sprayed with it this morning before school  matt started that garden himself for an environmental science class   they werent allowed to use pesticides  apparently he cheated a little  it was orange peel oil totally organic he dumped that other stuff last winter  the symptoms fit there must have been some left in the can  if youre wrong what will this treatment do to him  well theoretically it could increase the toxicity and  but were not wrong dont  were not wrong i cant let you do this  get a court order unless you wanna see someone killed by sheer irrationality  maternal instinct is always irrational doesnt mean its wrong  actually thats the definition  it doesnt make her mentally incompetent  shes risking her sons life  based on a teenagers claim that he washed something  how mentally incompetent can you get  thats a brilliant legal argument  listen have your harvard law dog whip up some highgrade legalsounding psychobabble  temporary insanity brought on by acute panic distress syndrome  i dont care we have to give him the hydrolase  her only sign of mental illness is that she disagrees with you  some would consider that a sign of sanity  not the kid lets ask him oh no i forgot we cant hes dying  get the mother to sign off that shes refusing this treatment  goodbye   i margo davis have been informed of the risks  which may arise from my refusal of advised medical care   i hereby release  who are you  i work for the hospital  the princeton plainsboro teaching hospital and its employees  agents and otherwise for any adverse medical conditions resulting from my refusal  it is not the hospitals fault if my son kicks off   kicks off  i punched up the language mostly for clarification  i understand my doctors consider my decision to be completely idiotic  why are you doing this but i am convinced i know more than they do  i took a biology course in high school  i assume thatsyeah  besides i enjoy controlling every single aspect of my sons life  even if it means his death  sign here please i brought a pen  who are you im the doctor whos trying to save your son  youre the mom whos letting him die  clarification its a beautiful thing   dr morell contact the caplab dr morell contact the caplab  she rethought her position start him on the hydrolase  no weve got a problem  three one two three  heart rates 49 o2 stat 84 and falling  saline atropine and diazepam now  his name is chi ling he was admitted 12 minutes ago  identical symptoms as matt chase isnt sure hes gonna make it  this one bag    matts nextdoor neighbor by any chance  they live 10 miles apart  apparently they dont even know each other    we live in an apartment we have two bamboo trees  no pesticides just dry seaweed for fertilizer   the second kids heart is almost as weak as matts we may need to get it wired up too  and i dont know how long matts brain will hold up his hearts not pumping enough oxygen  how much are you giving him  make it 90 were risking damage to his retina  what the heck do it anyway hes a calculus student  probably likes having a brain ill have foreman take care of it   im the primary  yeah but the mom wants to get rid of you  and you know me im a peoplepleasing kind of guy  she complained about me she went to the principal  told cuddy you took drugs in high school this is gonna go on your permanent record  i was trying to get information it was a strategy  she also used the word slacker you wanna come in  smoke a little weed watch some mtv  high school has no idea what could have happened  you sure that chi didnt sneak onto matts tomato patch  maybe they sniffed disulfoton together to get high  same school different grades different cliques different everything  they managed to get poisoned together they must have something in common  their classes arent even in the same building they dont even eat lunch in the same lunchroom  how do they get to school  unless youre with the board the police or the union i dont care who you are  sir we need to test the bus for chemical residue  and i need to pick up the basketball team  you got a problem with that call my supervisor  two kids were poisoned on your bus this morning  theyre dying  my god the things he said   dr house wanted your son to get the medicine he needed   he was willing to do whatever it took to make that happen  the wrong kind of medicine   he didnt know that at the time it was our only choice  he would have known if he had listened to me   he listened  he just assumed you were wrong  to be honest thats true of most of our patients   youre just as pompous and superior as he is  uh matt is back row right the asian kid uh first or second row left  okay look i got this rash in kind of my groin region  its um not a symptom  neither is being obnoxious looks like youre in the clear   so who poisoned em  were not sure yet if it was done on purpose  oh yeah you oughta see these little bastards screaming and punching each other all day long  did you happen to notice if anyone was doing any spraying near the bus route  oh yeah there was this truck down by the pond doing something or other  it smelled kinda funny too   oh dr house  well it took you long enough weve been waiting here  mr adams would you step outside for a moment  why because you irritate me  he is my son doctor  hes just a little cranky from not eating  fine mrs adams have you had any recent sexual activity  what  well l i dont suppose fantasies count  oh my god  unfortunately ive hit kind of a dry spell  only for the last oh i dont know 15 years  you see shes shes confused my father died eight years ago heart attack  not in bed dear  why do you ask  because you have tested positive for syphilis  thats impossible and insulting  i dont think its the first time that mom has heard this diagnosis  cupids disease thats what we used to call it  when did you get it  uh 1939 prom night i think  he had a chevrolet  it was before i met your father  but you said that  you said dad was your first love  he was  were talking about sex  but i was treated  which suppressed it in your case for 60 years  but now its back and the spirochetes that cause syphilis are eating away at your brain cells  oh thats revolting  its not as revolting as chlamydia thats got seepage  and its the 21 st century  weve got flying cars robot dogs and penicillin  highdose regimen for two weeks youre cured   i cant believe this  yeah well pinch yourself  i guess for the next two weeks id better practice safe sex  youll be fine just feed that cranky kid  the countys worried about west nile so they sprayed ethylparathion right next to the bus route  do you have the hydrolase for ethylparathion  yeah only one problem matts mother faxed his records to the cdc  she refuses to let us do anything until she hears back from them  well youre getting good at this godlike doctor racket  why dont you talk her out of this lunacy  shes not really a big fan of mine or mine  well only one man left in the bull pen and he throws like a girl  i hate sports metaphors  give her the high hard one  we really think the hydrolase is the only  im thinking about transferring matt out of here  ms davis your son is very sick he wont survive a transfer  im getting a second opinion from the center for disease control  right look when my grandmother got sick  what youre gonna tell me some tough decision you had to make   i know how hard this is for you  maybe embroider the story a little make it fit  i cant imagine being in your position  honesty a kind of vulnerable honesty thats your thing and the looks   oh boy  they send a single woman to hustle the single mom  actually they sent a doctor  to tell you that if your son doesnt get this treatment  theres a good chance hell die  thats what house said about a treatment that would have killed matt  youve gotta do better than that no its on you  you need to do better right now yes or no   i dont know  figure it out  wait     nurse   help  okay coming   seizing suction   watch his head  my son      coming  diazepam  got it   suction  ten milligrams   right  hes not responding another 10 milligrams  youre killing him   youre killing him  get her out of here get her outta here   come on maam maam     their hearts are barely pumping their lungs are shot  now theyre showing liver toxicity   i guess matts mom wont nominate us for any doctor of the year awards  only explanation is they got poisoned by something besides ethylparathion  then the hydrolase would release the neurotoxins instead of bonding with them  the only thing they have in common is the bus  except their symptoms given their severity  and the fact their cardiac symptoms are getting worse much faster than their other ones what does that tell us  the poison was probably absorbed through the skin  they were admitted at 845 and 1100 when were they poisoned  absorption through the skin anywhere from three to eight hours  in a case that bad more like one and a half to four  so matt was poisoned before 715 before he got on the bus  youre thinking each kid got poisoned in his own house two separate exposures  what do teenage boys do in the morning besides the obvious  wake up go to the bathroom  then the obvious then check their zits in the mirror   do they both use the same acne cream  because acne cream contains lanolin  which could have pesticides and youre thinking they both bought the same product   it was contaminated shaving cream  chi doesnt look like he shaves  but he sweats deodorant could contain lanolin  do these people have animals chi has a dog matt has a cat   fleas flea powder okay go to their houses  check for anything that might have touched their skin  between the time they got up and the time they went to school  im running low on tomato sauce   oh dr house hello   i sent you home  well i came back  i took a cab  so my son wouldnt try to chaperone us this time  im sorry but the fact that the sexual pleasure center  of your cerebral cortex has been overstimulated by spirochetes is  its a poor basis for a relationship i learned that one the hard way  doctor um these feelings that ive been having  is it all because of the syphilis  yes  then heres the prescription you gave me  well its not likely im going to infect anyone  no but itll kill you  well gotta go sometime  and   i really dont want to play canasta for the rest of my life  l i like feeling sexy again  and making a fool out of myself with handsome young doctors    do you think that i would have given you this  if it would stop you from flirting with me  well but if im cured then all the spirochetes will die off  but the little pieces of your cerebral cortex that have been destroyed wont grow back  youre brain damaged  doomed to feeling good for the rest of your life    really well thank you  georgia  yeah   when i stop being contagious  ill come by for a checkup   yeah   matt uses sure  chi uses old spice   no zit cream  lucky kid  floral air freshener doesnt matter  when was the last time you heard of a teenage boy using air freshener  pert shampoo  um johnsons over here  matts mom would make him use air freshener  there are limits to a mothers power even hers  just check  negative on the floral  matts alts are up to 800  if they get any higher we can toss his liver    yeah  no matches on flea powder or underarm deodorant   or any other kind of deodorant  what about shampoo  no to shampoo bar soap dish soap dish detergent  how about laundry detergent maybe they both washed their clothes this morning  ill check  you know if we cure matt  he can use his close brush with death on his college essays   admission guys love that stuff  thats how you got in right  jailhouse diary  uh tko  tko liquid  liquid 128 ounces   128 yellow jug special  environmentally safe formula  its the same bring in the detergent  so the detergent was contaminated with pesticides  which soaked into their clothes and got absorbed into their skin  hi uh listen the clothes your son wore today   he washed them this morning right  what  nice respectful asian kid does the laundry   my wife said he didnt  well then im betting he washed them last night without you knowing   he doesnt even know how to turn on the machine  and those clothes were new nobody washed them his clothes are all new  the ones he wore today yes never washed  now what  what about matts clothes were they new  uh theyre ratty old jeans i think  theyve been bagged and taken downstairs  davis yeah theyre matts  and theyre old  and yet the label isnt faded in the slightest  fake old hundred dollars for the homeless look  what kids arent pretentious in england  chi was wearing a different brand how could they both have been contaminated  that is the question for the ages meantime get these tested    i never bother to wash new clothes before i wear them  right your wife does she likes you feeling nice and comfortable  hey im a man i dont have time for laundry  im saving lives here  no she doesnt wash them either  so your skin absorbs a little dye the odd chemical here and there  you know me mr living on the edge  judging by the selfimportance of your strut you have identified the chemical in question   phosdrin  hit em with the hydrolase   chis parents said yes but  mighty mom said no  well shes gonna feel like a million bucks when chi lives and her son dies  send cameron shes the only one of you whos managed to talk her into anything  not this time matts mom wont make a move until she gets that opinion from the cdc   godot would be faster    what is this  thought id hang out   in case you change your mind    then i could give matt the medicine right away   dont worry ive got time  the cdc promised theyd call  im sure they will  maybe tomorrow maybe the day after  it takes time to review faxed records  then theyll probably tell you they cant make a decision based on faxed records  this is suzie  shes never gonna marry him no money  what makes you think youre right this time  same reason as last time  if you wanna see how the other kid does first thats okay  might help you although theres a real good chance   what matt might kick off  thats a little blunt  i was gonna say run out of time  or just kind of let my voice trail off    hello yes this is margo davis  but you have his records i sent them  yes i understand    they cant help me they havent seen him  they cant make a decision give it to him   the cdc is unable to give an opinion at this time maam  were gonna have a doctor in your area next week  you fooled her with that     house  so im gonna be cured as long as you dont wear any more poison pants  im sorry mom i knew the pants were stolen  they were only five bucks youre gonna give me hell arent you  oh honey im just glad youre alive  lets get you home so you can rest  maybe i am too hard on you  you dont have to make up that test till next week  you can stay in bed and work on your applications  some guy was selling pants off the back ofhis truck near the school  when he wasnt busy as a clothing entrepreneur  he did day labor at a cornfield out on route 1  he used the same truck for both jobs  so he spilled pesticide on the pants and was too lazy to clean up  real question is why are you still here  why arent you out there making up with the joyful mother   why would i do that no reason at all  if you dont care about her or her son  oh dr house  the cdc called   again  oops   who are those guys  oh theyre the arrogant jerks that saved your life      thats some bad hat harry
