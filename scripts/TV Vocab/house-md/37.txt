                     youre weight is 1139 pounds  are you gonna make me hurt you   i didnt think so     no  are you all right  did i hurt you  bob  bob whats wrong  what happened talk to me  oh my god okay honey hang on hang on  911 what is your emergency  yes we need an ambulance at 10600 xavier unit 4b  my husband cant breathe  oh my god  hes turning blue you have to send someone now please hurry   original airdate fox 28mar2006          you blow dry your hair  oh sorry did i wake you up  you blow dry your hair  excuse me for actually caring what i look like  i think the word youre looking for is obsessing  been at it for almost an hour  if you wanted in all you had to do is say so  i dont want in i want sleep  its about time you got up anyway its almost 900  this isnt gonna work  what  you staying here  youre kicking me out  after one night  what you think we should try counseling first  why do you want to sleep on a couch anyway you got money  at least until the divorce is finalized  ill be out of your hair tomorrow  whats left of it  bob it was three days ago  my throat got really dry and then my tongue felt like it was blowing up like a balloon  i assume somebody checked for food allergies  well the first two doctors both did  next one said it was a panic attack the one after that wanted to take his tonsils out  the last one had no idea he just referred us to dr house  it says the attack was preceded by some sort of strenuous physical activity  umyeah  what were you doing  awesome  a sex fiend with a swollen tongue  just think of all the places i can make foreman search  hes not a sex fiend hes a happily married man  no such thing  whatre you doing  testing a new caffeine delivery system  he didnt get his beauty sleep  wilsons moved in and apparently has unusually loud toenails  if theyre into rape fantasies sm is on  the menu as well  neck trauma could cause vocal chords paroxysms which could cause choking  cameron i didnt see  any sign of trauma and they were remarkably open  i asked about stds and they admitted participating in a threesome a few months ago  hundred bucks says theyre as miserable as the next couple  another guy or girl  girl his wifes college roommate  if hes not happily married i dont know who could be  theyre looking for something  if youre happy you got nothing to look for  his wife arranged it for an anniversary present  and if you ask me if two people really trust each other  a threesome once every seven years might actually help a marriage  okay i say we stop the ddx and discuss that comment  ill take the bet  maybe the first doctor was right a food allergy explains the anaphylaxis  could be neurological progressive bulbar paralysis would explain the symptoms  no als would affect his facial muscles before his throat  what if the problems not in his throat  thatd be a little odd considering thats where all his symptoms are   says who  the patient  since most patients cant tell their ulna from their anus  im guessing this guy also doesnt know the difference between choking and suffocating  his throat might be fine his lungs might be messed up  get more blood a chest ct and a body plethysmograph  unless of course you think we should be asking the patient where his anus is first  it uh feels like i have to urinate and then when i try to go  pull up your pants   its my prostate isnt it  nope not your prostate  herpes  herpes  herpes  your turn  if it makes you feel any better half the patients who come into this place have some sort of crotch rot  uh  no it doesnt  look this is impossible ive been married for 20 years  you had any sex in those 20 years   yes of course  then thats how you got it  the only person ive had sex with is my wife  bummer  take this once a day tell your wife to do the same  its not gonna cure it but itll lessen the frequency of the outbreaks  but there must be some mistake  you got any kids  yeah  any of them take guitar lessons  no  tennis art acting  my daughter does karate why  give this to her sensei  oh wait does your wife play tennis  no  thats what i figured it never hurts to make sure   for miyagi  im  gonna close the shutter now i need you to pant kind of like a dog    thats  good keep going  can i ask you a personal question  uh i guess  the umthe threesome andthe role playing is that because things get boring  no  we justenjoy our fantasies   you married  no  you can go back to taking the deep breaths now  marriages dont fail because couples get bored  they fail because  while theyre dating people pretend to be the person they think their partner wants and then  well theres only so long you can keep that up  maybe they are that person while theyre dating but then they change  people thinking their partner will change thats another reason marriages fail  people dont change  at least not in any way that really matters  i think youve had enough caffeine  you were right its not his throat its his lungs  plethysmograph revealed decreased lung capacity  and the ct showed lung scarring  its definitely interstitial pulmonary fibrosis whats not definite is the cause  theres no arthritis no sarcoidosis uh hes not on any prescription meds  and hes a wedding photographer so i doubt he got exposed to coal dust or asbestos at work  cause could be idiopathic  cant be idiopathic idiopathic means without a known cause  what i meant was that  what you meant was you dont know what the cause is  just say that and we can avoid this conversation  no applause   whats his current condition  stable   then we can wait  wait for what  for whatever you cant figure out to cause something else  you know its going to  its possible the ipf could just continue to   theres something wrong with his skin  okay stop scratching i gotta look at it  i cant this is driving me crazy  stop scratching so   make it stop  okay  make it stop  make it stop  now we got something to discuss  what causes both lung scarring and the itchy splotchy red blotchies  its obviously not a reaction to medication we havent given him any yet  right but what besides what its obviously not can cause both lung scarring and the splotchies  where are you going  to complete the second half of the caffeine delivery system  either talk louder or get in here  same color coming out as going in  you think thats a marketing thing  lupus could cause lung scarring and a rash  or it could still be a food allergy  weve already ruled out allergies  did we  wheres cameron  were in the mens room  we need an allergy expert in here  this can wait two minutes  you dont know that  chase thinks that food allergies should still be on the table  no it wouldnt explain the lung scarring  some homeopathic studies have found a connection between food allergies and autoimmune reactions  which could cause lung inflammation  yeah and some homeopathic studies have also found that groundup spiders can cure cancer  can i go now  no  lungs skin skin lungs  sklungs  lungs skin  throat  heavy metal toxicity  it explains the lungs the itching  the swelling in his tongue and throat  i thought you didnt believe there was anything wrong with this throat  i never said i didnt believe it  i just said i had good reason to doubt it  and now  and now i have good reason to doubt those doubts  patients a little old to be chewing paint off the walls  nor does he drink well water or eat fish every day or do anything else that couldve exposed him to heavy metals  he and his wife worked a wedding in cabo san lucas last month  a lot of pottery in mexico is contaminated with leadbased paint  now arent you glad you joined us  search their house and screen his blood and hair for lead  and test for mercury and arsenic while youre at it  chase  find out what the resort cooks with and if they have repainted recently or did any plumbing repairs  i dont speak spanish  then itll be challenging  good lord  what is that smell  stuffed pepper  stuffed with what  vomit  thought you were going to a hotel  i found an apartment  i can move in on monday is that fast enough for you  whats today  whered you get all that stuff  well not from your kitchen  dont you ever eat anything besides canned soup and peanut butter  dont you eat anything that doesnt look like its been rolled onto your plate by a dung beetle  try it  its good isnt it  no  just better than it looks  how much beans and rice do you think youd have to eat from a ceramic pot  painted with leadbased paint to get enough lead into your system to damage your lungs  are we talking a child or an adult  adult  then id say a lot  youd have to beans every day for months  now why do you have a season pass to the new yankee workshop  its a complete moron working with power tools  how much more suspenseful can you get   imi was watching something  no  you were about to watch something  im watching something see the difference  if the water was contaminated wouldnt i be sick too  people can metabolize toxins at different rates  well test it to be sure   have you done any recent renovations  no  have any problem with bugs or rodents  just the occasional ant  use bug spray  no i hate the smell  luckily both of us are pretty anal about keeping things clean  yeah i can tell  you think ants are the problem  can you stop stuffing your mouth with pancakes for one second  these arent pancakes these are macadamia nut pancakes  wilson made em and theyre amazing   she said she doesnt use bug spray but  silver dollar slices of heaven   some ants are poisonous maybe  forget the 72 virgins  if i blow myself up in a crowded restaurant  im gonna be asking for a plate of these babies  is the ant big and red or small and black  medium and brown  halle berry brown or beyonc brown  is there a difference  is there a difference  army ants could devour dissolve eat a cow in a matter of hours  australian bull ants on the hand  are nasty little bastards but theyre more of a nuisance than a threat no surprise there  beyonc  well then thats not it  how much clay did he eat at the resort  its a fivestar 400anight place they dont cook with ceramic pots  tox screen  no evidence of lead mercury or arsenic  run em again  call the resort find some disgruntled employee to talk to   go back to the home  its not heavy metals   the symptoms say it is  the tests say its not  well who you gonna believe the symptoms or the tests  could also be a food allergy  cameron says its not  if your tests can be wrong why cant hers  his diet hasnt changed since he was a kid his favorite foodis corn flakes  which i assume he eats with milk one of the most common adult onset food allergies  start treating him for lead poisoning its the most likely heavy metal  and yeah you can test him for allergies for dairy wheat and legume  i  am not having an affair with my daughters karate instructor and i did not give my husband herpes  found out where house is  if youre convinced its allergies whyre you giving him drugs to treat lead poisoning  were not convinced of anything yet  i  think i need something else this cream isnt working  were doing everything we can  ow  sorry  no no its not my back its my feet  i think i stepped in something when i went to the bathroom  uh its on my socks its burning  i dont see anything  bob please take my socks off  wait wait wait wait  ow stop stop stop  what did you just scratch him with  if there was an allergic reaction itd be on his back not on his feet  oh god its burning please make it stop  gonna need some gabapentin in here  excruciating pain in the lower extremities  not a sign of a food allergy  means theres a neurological problem  more significantly its yet another classic sign of heavy metals  and i just did yet another hair and blood test for lead and everything else he could possibly have been exposed to theyre all negative  its gotta be something else   lupus could cause  no  lupus progresses slower thered be joint pain  so its not a typical case   we should get an ana  its not lupus  symptoms dont match  and the tests dont match heavy metals    maria its happening again hes not breathing  tongues swelling airways closing hes not getting any air   his lungs are clear  were gonna have to intubate  try to relax bob this is gonna help you breathe  oh my god  hes gonna aspirate need suction  whats happening  suction  theres too much vomit were never going to be able to intubate  we need to trach him  hes  not breathing  foreman his urine has elevated proteins and red blood cells  its lupusinduced kidney failure if we dont start treatment  heavy metal toxicity could cause vomiting  and so would lupus nephritis and it also causes tissue swelling  hes choking on his tongue not his feet  the corticosteroids we gave him to control the inflammation can cause facial swelling  its still not his throat but youre getting closer  im doing an ana and a serum compliment  if youre so sure why waste time with tests just start treatment  oh no wait we cant do that because we already have and its not working ergo  corticosteroids arent the only treatment for lupus nephritis  we could also try cyclophosphamide or immunosuppressants  only if we confirm the diagnosis with an ana serum compliment antidna iv pyelogram and kidney biopsy  so now you suddenly believe in tests   the symptoms  the symptoms all point to heavy metal poisoning  yeah we all get it  unless youve got proof and can tell me which heavy metal it is  im starting treatment for lupus  systemic lupus erythematosus causes the immune system to become hyperactive  attack normal tissue  it could be what caused the lung inflammation  as well as the swelling in his throat and now what appears to be damage to his kidneys  the treatments usually steroids  but hes already on steroids  if the tests confirm were on the right track there are other medications we can try  and if those dont work  well lupus is a chronic condition but its generally controllable  what do you mean generally  in rare cases it can cause cardiovascular or renal failure  cardiovascular and  renal thats uh the heart and the kidneys right  yeah   dont worry itll be all right  enjoying the salad  theres no lettuce  im aware that theres no lettuce  do you know when i obtained this knowledge  actually im in the middle of  when i made it  for myself  well how was i supposed to know  welli was hoping this might tip you off  thats kind of selfish dont you think  i offered to make you some you said no  ah that was before i tasted the pancakes  its a compliment you should be flattered  here  its mrs lamberts herpes test results  mrs who  youve told more than one patient his wife is sleeping with his daughters karate teacher  you wanna stir the pot you have to clean up the mess  what would you do if you got herpes  shes coming in at 500 dont make me come looking for you  actually i know what youd do but i mean a normal guy  and dont be calling in sick or saying that your team needs you for some kind of emergency consult  if he suspected that maybe his wife had also been playing pickle games he could just keep it on the down low  at least wait till she got infected  youd give your own wife herpes just to shift the blame onto  oh hed give his own mother herpes if it got him out of clinic duty  of course maybe it was the wife  maybe she was the one who  wheres mrs nympho  shes waiting outside why  go search her  what you mean her medical records  if i meant that good chance id have said that  you think shes poisoning him  his symptoms should be getting better the longer hes here instead theyre getting worse  so either shes poisoning him or its not heavy metals  weve done over ten different heavy metal tox screens  because theres no reason to test for the other 30  they dont get into the air or food they only get in you if someone puts them in you  and the only way were going to find out what shes been sprinkling on his corn flakes is to search her  i am not going to accuse a woman of trying to murder her own husband based simply on some paranoid theory  its the only explanation  weve eliminated every other possibility  we have not eliminated every other possibility  has he responded to the latest lupus treatment  hes only been on it for a few hours  he hasnt responded because its not lupus  its not allergies als arthritis or sarcoidosis  shes all thats left  do it  hi  im dr house  mind if i take a lookin your purse  why  because im going to need to search it and you for whatever youre using to poison your husband  why would i want to hurt my husband  then you wont mind if i search your things  go ahead  you satisfied  absolutely not  she agreed to let me search everywhere else but this she says no to  doesnt that tell you something  yes that she doesnt want some lunatic doctor searching her vagina with a flashlight  oh cameron could do that  im not going to  the woman hasnt left the hospital since they arrived  whatever shes using shes obviously hiding somewhere  shes not poisoning him  its the only explanation  no its the only explanation your twisted mind can come up with  because youre angry that you cant find the answer and youre taking it out on her  and you are protecting a complete stranger based on some childishly romantic notion that  people are all so happily married they dont want to kill each other  you calling me childish  grow up  shut up  both of you and stay away from his wife  sorry im not giving you permission to assault someone  lets see im thinking  colonel mustard in the music room with the candlestick  theres no music room its the conservatory   same thing  no it isnt  if we dont find out what shes using and start treatment immediately hell be dead in a week  if youre right  if foremans right youd have basically raped an innocent woman  my wife fired the maid  apparently shes getting rid of everything that reminds her of me  you did your maid  i was nice to our maid whichannoyed her god knows why  maybe she was doing her  no one was doing her all right  but you still feel responsible  even though nothing or no one was done its still your fault  i offered to keep paying her salary until she found another job  but she refused to take any money without doing any work so  if you want someone to clean your apartment  its on me  youre supposed to moving out not moving more people in  shes not moving in shes gonna clean  maybe i should just move out and the the two of you could  oh god    oh god no  call a code  please  charge it to 360 give him epi  clear  still no pulse  charging clear  i got a pulse  pupils are reactive  you still with us  he was without oxygen for less than a minute it cant be hypoxia  could be a stroke  honey can you hear me  back up  bob talk to me bob  honey please  bob can you hear me  hes awake  can you hear me  honey   hi  yes she is quite the little actress  so lets say shes not poisoning him  theres nothing more to discuss  weve got lungand kidney failure neurological symptoms and now cardiac arrest  a systemic disease with multiorgan involvement is the definition of lupus  autoimmune suppressants arent helping  we should start him on cyclophosphamide see if it makes a difference  yeah and interferon  interferon isnt an approved treatment for lupus  youre not still thinking  interferon isnt an approved treatment for heavy metal toxicity either  true but its pretty much the only thing we can do for a viral infection  we didnt consider it because  because it doesnt make sense theres no fever  because hes got no immune system  thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribe for lupus treatment  he didnt present with a fever either  because at that point he was a postviral autoimmune reaction  which again  thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribed for lupus treatment  his immune system basically rolled out the red carpet  for the dormant virus waking it up turning it into a present viral infection  give him interferon  but if it is lupus interferon could make it worse  suppress his bone marrow even further  which is more likely  a rapidly progressing acuteonset lupus in a patient whos already on steroids  or a team of doctors missing a postviral reaction  we didnt miss anything  well then im wrong and you shouldnt give him interferon  intravenous interferon has been shown to be effective against some viral infections  but i thought you said it wasnt an infection you said it was lupus  the increasingly rapid progression of the symptoms has caused us to reconsider  and what if youre wrong here too  what if its not a virus  there are risks with interferon  especially in a patient whos already immunosuppressed  look at this point youre lungs kidneysand heart are all failing  we really dont have any choice   i cheated  what  earth science  mr foley  i sat behind you so i could cheat off of you  and i let you cheat so youd sit behind me  i thought we were gonna grow old together  in 9th grade  no 10th  what you had to make sure i put out first  no  i knew you put out in the 7th grade  i love you  yeah i know  say you love me  no   why not  becauseyoure not dying  say it anyway  you gonna make me hurt you  i love you  foreman its not working  both his lungs and kidneys are continuing to deteriorate   up the dose  we already have  apparently not enough  i dont think its a virus  weve been running titers for everything we could think of theyre all negative    increase the interferon  house  you got a better idea other than lupus  no  then up the dose  mr and mrs lamberts appointment was over an hour ago  sorry i was sick and my team needed an emergency consult  your wife has herpes  what  that thats impossible i dont have any  you havent had an outbreakyet  dont worry you will  you rutty jackass  me i havent been with anyone in 20 years  but youre the one with the blisters on his  doesnt mean that he got it first  you dont need to have an outbreak to spread the virus  yeah and youre the one always talking about wanting more sex  from you  and maybe id get more if you werent actually getting it somewhere else  well you two obviously have a lot to talk about  dont even think about dumping this on my lap  theres gotta be someway to prove that its him  im sorry there is no test  either you two ever sit on a public toilet  well  of course  herpes can live for short periods of time outside the body  dr house you know you cant get herpes  some politically correct doctors will tell you that its impossible to get infected by a toilet seat  but theyll also tell you not to use the same bath towel to dry your crotch and your face during an outbreak  see the contradiction  i always use a paper cover   always  yes of course  what about you  no  i never knew  oh please this is ridiculous  damn i was sure it was miyagi  what  he could believe that you can get herpes from a toilet seat or  he could be cheating on you and just be happy to have an out  the toilet seat makes sense doesnt it  sure but shed only refused to believe such a well presented lie if she were innocent  and since you both cant be innocent you rutty jackass  oh you   thanks a lot  my pleasure  honey wait please  wow  not bad  she has a family history of arthritis doesnt she  yeah she does what does  stop the interferon  do another heavy metal screen only this time test for gold  you dont still think that she  and dont let her go to the bathroom  why would you care if she   hello  ho  hi  im lady  whatd you do to my closet  i cleaned it  uh dr wilson said that i could go ahead  its not dr wilsons closet  wheres the wood box   a wood box  yes the wood box  its made of wood and its boxshaped  its been in the back of thiscloset since the day i moved in  i didnt seeany kind of wood  you may not have seen it but youve obviously moved it the question is where  well i did not move anything i just  look it was in this closet then you came now its not in this closet  okay uhwhat type of box  wood wood  its a brown wood box its got a metal handle on the top it looks like a  like a tackle or a toolbox  ah you mean the chest  the one thats under the bed  do you need to fix something  um thanks  well fine then ill go to one on another floor  well actually theyre not working there either  every bathroom in the whole hospital is out of order  well theyre umthe water  im going to the bathroom  where is she  she had to go to the bathroom   i told you not to let her  what was i supposed to do   tie her up  why not she likes that  what are you doing  uh your hand is wet  sorry must be nervous  i got some bad news  what  the damage to your husbands lungs is permanent  the kidney damage is reversible and with the right therapy  he should regain full neurological function  other than the fact that hes not gonna be running any marathons he should be fine  but thats good news isnt it  im not finished  when i was a kid my dad was stationed in a marine base in egypt  we were in the middle of nowhere and there was absolutely nothing for a kid to do except  look for a mummys tomb  you didnt want me to go to the bathroom because you wanted to tell me  my husband is going to be fine and thatyou used to live in egypt  i didnt have a problem with you going to the bathroom  i just didnt want you to wash your hands  i never actually found a mummy  but i did learn a fair amount about the ancient egyptians  for example they discovered that stannous chloride is not only great for toughening ruby glass  but if its mixed with gold it turns bright purple  now either your fingers actually are worth their weight in gold  or youve been sprinkling your husbands cereal with gold sodium thiomalate  its an arthritis remedy that its rarely used here in the in the us but its still popular in mexico  gotta give you props  ive never heard of anyone using gold before  its almostpoetic  its ridiculous  heavy metal tox screen for gold was off the chart  why would i  because you were trying to kill him  id love to know the why behind that why  but youre not gonna tell me are you  youre wrong i  i love bob  i never said you didnt love him  how does somebody do that  sit by someones bedside day and night helping them comforting them and at the same time killing them  maybe he was having an affair  maybe she was having an affair  or maybe she just gets her kicks out of slowly sucking the life out of a guy watching him suffer  he mustve done something to her  yeah he had it coming  i didnt say he deserved it  the only thing he did wrong was marry a sociopath  or maybe she just got tired of being married  didnt want to admit to family and friends that the marriage everyone thought was perfect wasnt  shouldnt of us stay with her  what is she tries to run  yeah cameron go back there  itd be weird if we were all in the ladies room  cameron we started chelation therapy with dimercaprol  thrilled to hear it  his kidney function hasnt improved  it will  hes gonna need a lung transplant  hes becoming more attractive by the minute isnt he  youre pleased  you think youve proved every marriage is a mistake  do i look pleased  ignorance is bliss  love and happiness by al green   love and happiness    wait a minute   something goin wrong    someones on the phone    300 in the mornin   yeah    talkin about    how she can make it right yeah    well    happiness is when    you really feel good about somebody    theres nothin wrong    bein
