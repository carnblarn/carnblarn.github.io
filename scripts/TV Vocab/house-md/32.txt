                so there i am on my 25th birthday driving from wheeling west virginia to bensonhurst in a dodge dart with no radio  and a gun runner named barrelhead   who insisted we sing every jimmy buffet song he could recall  what can i say the man was heavily armed   so 500 renditions of margaritaville later  my first cover 8000 words on how barrelhead and his friends were transporting handguns for sale to new york city  the day the magazine hit the stands the da hit me with a subpoena  he wanted to know barrelheads real name  greta had been managing editor for three whole days  so she invited me across the street to the fancy bar where they use real glasses   and after about the sixth vodka and tonic  she said fletch i want you to know the magazine is behind you  well i was impressed  i said  do you think you can get the da off my back  and she said no but when you get out of jail youll still have a job   im 45 ive given up a lot ive given up the road that life  thanks  elizabeth no regrets my lovely wife  ive given up drinking ive given up drugs  greta taught me theres two things you never give up  ones rock and roll the others a source  greta sims    great memories greta  well miss you greta  well miss you  i only hope you can adjust to the lack of stress in your  fletch  fletch  fletcher  fletch  fletcher  fletcher  honey sweetie are you okay  oh  are you okay  i flung the investment   what did you say  i flung the investment  why consign  why consign  ill call 911  its proficient  why disqualify the rush im tabled  im tabled   original airdate fox 10 jan2006    i need your advice  whats the best diagnostics department within 60 miles of here  we are  we arent here  house is in baltimore lying to medicaid about his billings   so im board certified  you are not house  whyd you put me in charge of the department if you think i cant handle it  because its temporary and because i was ordered to   what are the symptoms  oh come on  youre gonna diagnose him without meeting him  prove that youre as brilliant as house  i need to know the symptoms to know which hospital to recommend  emts report patient struck his head and is suffering from aphasia  hmm neurological problem  you know i know a lot of good people in that field seeing as i happen to be a neurologist   youre pouting  not at all  taylors pretty good  house was ready to hire him till he got my resume  its fletcher stone  wrote 12 books exposed three administrations   before he exposes us  i get it famous patient needs famous doctor   ill call taylor  thank you  or maybe you should call him  what if i say something stupid  oh god  house is easier  have you been taking any drugs  i displaced my function accolade  he used to drink regularly but hes been clean and sober for nearly a year  mr stone you think youre speaking normally but your speech is impaired  he knows what he wants to say but when he reaches for a word he finds something else  i grapple average  tanzer glisten  he doesnt know that hes saying it wrong  it all sounds right to him  i want you to write your name and draw a face  its called agraphia loss of ability to write most often its temporary  how hard did he hit his head  it was a pretty good crack it made a really ugly sound  do you understand what im saying  of golf  dont give me a sentence just say yes or a no  you understand me  yes  elizabeth fletch  is he okay  we  dont know this is fletchs editor  greta sims i wanted to make sure that the emts told you the right story  how many stories are there  he didnt trip  he just fell out of the blue  his foot jerked a little bit first thats what made it look like a trip  stacy dont say anything  dont attempt to defend your billing practices  your billing practices are indefensible  weve  been over this  if i thought you were capable of listening id shut up  that makes no sense at all    good afternoon  good afternoon  every case you have rates a five on the complexity scale  dr house has a rather specialized practice  ah okay  then lets go through these  all of these  if you have lunch reservations cancel them  all right patient  if he didnt trip something made him fall  stoke seizure  one person says he didnt who you gonna believe  his symptoms can all be explained by the head trauma  causes a contusion or a seizure that causes the aphasia  we should get an eeg  if it was a stroke it could be a clotting issue  even if he fell drug use is far more likely  im ordering a tox screen  chase were not done with the differential  youre not my boss  im houses boss house is your boss  the math is pretty simple  are you signing my paychecks are you hiring or firing  this is not about that  the only thing youve been asked to do is supervise house in case he doessomething insane  which might you know save a life   somebodys gotta be in charge  why  you think we should all just do whatever we wanna do  maybe have a race to the diagnosis  i think it should be a discussion among peers  i think were grown up enough to reach a consensus  patient 62 years old you prescribed viagra  i look in vain for the words erectile dysfunction in the notes for delores smith  she had a heart condition  and you ran out of nitroglycerin  she also had low blood pressure  so nitro would be dangerous  little blue pills improve blood flow  theyre vasodilators  its why you sometimes get the headaches  stacy i think dr house understands  house oh of course i do  the woman has a heart condition shes on her own  a man cant nail his office assistant its national crisis time  are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for offlabel use of medication  fine ill pay for it  how much are the pills she took how many  put the money away   are you trying to bribe me  no  i could theres an atm in the lobby  my clients an idiot  but is he wrong about the pills  offlabel use is not sanctioned  youre retiring in three weeks  youve been doing this job nearly 20 years  arent you tired of administering policy you disagree with   ii never said i disagree  what can they do to you  and dr house is sorry about his earlier outburst  absolutely  you do background checks on medicaid personnel  i do whats necessary for my client   wow new personal record  yeah timings good for me too  i got a reservation at a little place in the inner harbor   you booked us dinner reservations  best maryland crab inmaryland   dont you have a plane to catch  not for hours  your flight leaves at 700  you did a background check on me  and mine doesnt leave till 900pm  it looks like youll be dining alone  you checked on my flight  so you could be sure to be on a different one  i thought we were past the avoidance stage  i didnt think wed be finished this soon  wheres your crucifix  i left it at the jewelers to be cleaned  right  this will show us if theres a problem with your carotid artery that might cause a blood clot  if it went to his brain that could explain the aphasia and the falling down  and youre giving him an eeg is that for the same thing  uh its just a precaution  i think the trauma caused some swelling and we need to keep him stable until the bodycan repair the damage  and you think theyre both wrong  foreman were just covering all the bases   being safe     his o2 sats are going down     fluid in his lungs  push 40 iv lasix   we need to intubate  hes losing his respiratory drive  now put him down  foreman and then there were two  aphasia and fluid in the lungs  seizure cant cause both  neither can a stroke  unless he had an abnormal heart rhythm  chase and then there was one  urine test is positive for amphetamines  amphetamines dont cause pulmonary edema  they doif you smoke em  in one of his books he talked about giving updrugs and alcohol how it changed his life  everybody lies  when he started wanting to hear every minute of my day  it should have been a clue he was the jealous type  but you know in that first stage of a relationship  where its like your bodys full of these chemicals that make you think everything they do is charming   ah  excuse me  wilson hello  hey honey how are the kids they miss me  this may take a minute  house so whats new with mr aphasia  cuddy called you  everybody covers their ass  wilson pulmonary edema  chase did a tox screen it came back positive for amphetamines  he did the dance of victory  im betting theres another shoe  i thought the kids didnt call you    i know the way you tell stories  foreman went to talk to stone about his drug test found him running a temperature  so its not the drugs  theyve just got such a bad rep   mother honey you shouldnt do that  okay i gotta hang up  theyre probably trying to reach me   you dont have call waiting  im hanging up on you now  wilson its 500 a month    drugs dont cause fever  encephalitis or meningitis are the obvious suspects start him on antibiotics  it could be an autoimmune disease lupus behcets  we could start himon a high dose of steroids   except if he does have encephalitis steroids could weaken his immune system  foreman  how high a fever  put me on speaker phone and why havent you called me  howd you know  what you think you guys can have a party as soon as the parents are gone and i wont hear about it  house start with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible bacterial meningitis  and an antiviral in case we luck out and its herpes encephalitis  what if its autoimmune  well then were screwed  which is why we need more information  any genetic issuewith the family  foreman the man cant talk  his medical records are sketchy and the wifes only known him a couple of years  house mri show anything  ct scan was negative  ct  thats like short for mri right  excellent thatll save us a lot of time  weve got an mri scheduled in 20 minutes  earliest foreman could get the machine  i teach you to lie cheat and steal  and as soon as my back is turned you wait in line  get an mri and get a better medical history  the man cant talk  who cares hes probably gonna lie anyway  my flights a little late ill be back in a few hours  so youre in charge of us because youre in charge of him  any family history of neurological problems  no  youve been out of the country in the last five years  yes  three years  yes  two years  he stopped traveling for work two years ago after we got serious  any vacations  his  last one was six months ago  it was a golf resort at key biscayne  no way it was a golf resort  knowing fletch i assume he was working his way through every bar in the keys  last hurrah before settling down    alcohol  no   amphetamines  no  you tested positive  elizabeth he doesnt use drugs i told you  when we got engaged we decided we wanted a different kind of life  and he dropped the macho journalism no more taking crazy chances  that includes his health  he asked me not to tell elizabeth  hes been lying to herabout his drug habit  well yes and no  bebefore elizabeth he used drugs recreationally  i wasnt crazy about it  but that thrillseeking behavior is what made him the kind of journalist that he was  and now ae  the mans twisted himself into knots for her   completely cleaned up his act  but the drugs  theyre medicinal sort of  he was having trouble sleeping  his  new suburban lifestyle  lack of excitement was throwing him off  so he started with sleeping pills  when they knocked him out he needed something to perk him back up during the day  chase every day  no slippery slope there  keep the stain knife cant force  were not gonna tell your wife  were not cops  theres a little edema brain swelling  and an area of scarring  is that whats causing the aphasia  actually thats whats odd  the scarrings not in the area of the brain normally associated with conduction aphasia  and its old happened before he hit his head  maybe a small stroke or some other underlying condition that could be causing this or  it might have nothing to do with it at all  have you ever had head trauma before   an accident  uhuh  you ever had any numbness on one side before   dizziness  what is the durable   shh  no  announcement boarding passengers for flight number 870  the plane will be delayed by one halfhour we apologize  thanks  got you some coffee  sowhat do you wanna talk about  the scarring on the mri could be anything  ms  toxins any one of a hundred demyelinating diseases  if its meningitis we have to id the bug fast  we need to do a lumbar puncture  im not doin lp with this edema   we could paralyze him  what does house say  the person youre trying to reach is out of the area or has turned off their phone  so what are your orders   we need more information  there is no more information  well break into his place  have fun  hows the patient  fine   where you going foreman  dinner  oh well ill join you you can bring me up to speed  sorry reservation for two  when people give themselves away its by little things  that woman over there  shes not sneering at her coffee shes recovering from bells palsy  the cashier at the coffee place she doesnt want anyone to know but shes dying of als  theres a particular sort of twitchy stiff arm thats characteristic  and then theres you  why arent you wearing your cross  i told you i left it at  you keep jewelry cleaner under the sink so you wont have to go a day without it  true you forgot it that morning the pipes burst  but then you went back and waded through the flood to retrieve it  sowhy no wading today  didnt you bring a book to read or something  nothing  caffeine pills and amphetamines same stuff he told us he was taking  and topamax  an anticonvulsant  he said there was no history of prior seizure  its not even prescribed to him  still doesnt explain his fever probably just using it for weight loss  just gives us another lie he must really be devoted  should we check the home  if he wanted to hide something from his wife why wouldnt he hide it in the office  maybe shes hiding something  nothing but aspirin and flu meds in the bathroom  looks like this stuffs been sitting here for weeks  chase hmm home improvement  he probably thought he could take the project on  then realized it was a little more than he could handle  you got a point to make or did you just feel like giving a long unnecessary explanation for something medically irrelevant  what happened to the foreman who always has an answer  the guy who practically wears a sign saying  im as good as house but im nicer  i never said that  i guess its safe to be confident when house is there to overrule you  now that its all on you  its different yeah  announcement flight 106 to nashville has been delayed  either you left it behind on purpose or by mistake  the only reason youd leave it behind intentionally is if it no longer meant anything to you  but since it was a gift from your mom  that would mean you had a fight with her  and since you dont talk to ghosts thats unlikely   leave it alone greg  yeah im good at that  so that leaves forgetting it unintentionally  but then we have to explain why you didnt go back for it when you realized  i didnt realize until i got to the airport  nope you were wearing makeup when you got to the airport  you cant put on makeup without looking at yourself  you cant look at yourself without touching that thing  why does this matter to you  its an anomaly anomalies bug me  then youre gonna suffer    i think its his stomach  i teal indigent  is it something you ate  he keeps doing that  i teal indigent   are you hungry  no   hes in pain is it a sharp pain  no  teal indigent   taste  yes   uh metallic taste  yes  ill be right back  ow  attention passengers flight 118  house i suppose its also possible that the clasp broke  but then youd be carrying the thing around in your purse  we had a fight  we had a fight and i was angry and not thinking straight  and i walked out without my makeup and without my cross  and i stopped at the drugstore to buy makeup but i couldnt buy a cross  because they dont have an aisle for personal talismans  so you had a fight im sure itll blow over   it was about nothing  of course it was  marks tired hes worried hes got mobility problems  its normal to blow up over little things  i dont mind fighting over little things and i dont mind fighting over big things  that i could understand but we fight over nothing  you know a mailbox with a sign that says last pickup 500 pm  does that mean last pickup to go to the post office or last pickup to leave the post office and be sent out of town  you fought over mail delivery  i tried to get him to drop the subject but he wouldnt  i told him he was right he thought i was being condescending  you were  hes pushing me out of his life  or maybe youre misinterpreting  did i misinterpret with you  at least this time i recognize it  thats the benefit of convincing the only two men youve ever loved  theyre better off without you  yeah its all your fault  you know stacy in the original greek means relationship killer  im gonna go wash my face so i look like a grownup again   hello  its for you  house  do you know your phones dead  do you ever recharge your batteries  house they recharge  i just keep buying new phones  i thought you should know your aphasia guy is tasting metal  wheres his creatinine  68 hes got kidney failure  camerons got him on dialysis and hes stable for the moment  unlike cuddy whos suicidal  its either meningitis or encephalitis  or maybe autoimmune  thats perfect seems like you really narrowed it down over dinner  heres the plan we talk to house  been trying hes not answering his cell  its obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture  theres no choice anymore   house you have to do it just right  what are you talking about  either youve decided to do a lumbar puncture  or you have to fire me so that i cant fire all of you as soon as i get back in charge  is cuddy there ranting  if id known youd be out of contact  they can handle it  right so far only three organ systems have failed  okay they cant doesnt matter  the guys not stable enough to move  so go rant in your own office  fine call me when youre done  what do you mean by doing the lp just right were not gonna screw it up  the odds are this guy knows something we dont  he could know the answer to the meaning of life the man cant communicate  have you had any indication that hes tried to communicate something important  no  thats because you guys havent scared him enough  im sure youve been all well take realgood care of you  why should he say anything  when you prep him tell him hes gonna die  crush all hope dont let cameron do it  cuddy  you got a problem with any of that  youre scheduled for a lumbar puncture  but you shouldnt count on that having the answers  if your husband continues to decline  youll die  if theres anything you havent told us  how you holding up  i know what you just heard is scary as hell but  couldnt tackle the bear  couldnt tackle the bear  they took my stain  your attention please due to the weather conditions  all flights are grounded until further notice  oh  you gotta be kiding  cots are being provided on the lower level  we apologize for the inconvenience  i dont believee it  you want me to run down and reserve you a cot with a view  wheres your knapsack  i checked it through  oh thats right i forget its hard for you to carry and walk  i booked a room at the airport hotel when i saw how bad the weather was  its the last one available  your leg cant handle a night on a cot  thanks  im ready  right  hotels upstairs  does mark know about this  mark knows when things are bad i always like to have an escape route planned   i have to know whats going on here  when you have a fight with mark and you try to avoid me i have to think that  that im feeling vulnerable and i dont wanna be around you because it might lead to something  right  but then a hotel room  might also lead to something  hmm  so which is it  our relationships like an addiction its like  really good drugs  no its like vindaloo curry  okay sure  really really hot indian curry they make with red chili peppers  i know what it is  i didnt think it was addictive  youre abrasive and annoying and come on way too strong like  vindaloo curry when youre crazy about curry thats fine but  no matter how much you love curry you have too much of it it takes the roof of your mouth off  and then you never wanna see curry for a really really long time  but you wake up one day and you think  god i really miss curry  youre a jerk  i know  if you hadnt just had a fight with mark  for once in your life will you shut up   oh  house  youre on speaker phone  how did the lp go  give me the readers digest condensed version  preliminary results are some kind of infection whichnarrows it down  from infinity yeah  at the rate his organs are deteriorating hes got maybe a day or two  okay well call me back when you have something  cameron he was trying to tell us something  what did he say  you were wrong it wasnt the fear   he opened up to me when i  sympathetic presence after a traumatic moment  classic interrogation technique what did he say   you knew that id  act the way you always do  yeah i did what did he say  he couldnt tackle the bear  now all we need is the englishaphasiac dictionary  a fluent aphasiac retrieves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants  they can be filed by sound or by meaning  so if he wants to say table he could say label or he could say chair  or he could just say jabberwocky theres no way to tell  he also said they took my stain  hold on  im gonna take this phone downstairs so i dont disturb you is that okay  sure  keep him talking write down everything he says  stacy   that new makeup you bought you mind if i borrow it  what did you mean by stain  dirty soiled  no no  foreman what about rhymes uh pain brain  thane  hes dying from some kind of infection and you allare playing word games  is there anything else you havent told us  foreman llets start this again  bear is it bare as in naked  crimson desire shows up well on sheet rock  thats why i chose it  you must have gotten one new phrase out of him something  weve been talking to him for hours  maybe hes just given up  you sure you told me everything you found at his home and office  chase no were hiding something   maybe its not a rhyme or a synonym  what else is there  you think we should just start guessing randomly  maybe house is wrong  hope thats not the end of the thought  he mentioned stain once before when chase was giving him the mri   before we scared him  he did  its in your notes  chase so he only talks during mris and lumbar punctures  your theory is he can only talk with a needle in his back or  or when his wifes not in the room  the more devoted the more reason to lie  thats cynical  you disagree  no im just kvelling our little girl is growing up  okay whats the best way to rip a woman from the side of her dying husband  he woke me up to lie to a patients wife  tell her theres been a miscommunication over their insurance coverage  not a big deal  tell me if it is your aim to sell me the same crazy ideas that house does  how are you an improvement on house  i brought you a coffee  your flights been boarding for 20 minutes  ill take a later one  greg they cant leave without you you checked your knapsack   are we in  yeah  house hi im gregory house  im your attending physician  your wifes not there start talking  they took my stain  i couldnt tackle the bear they took my stain  house okay shut up now nice work cameron  give him the list again  let us know when something sounds right  dirty  soiled pain   brain  yes  foreman where does that get us  were already paying plenty of attention to his brain  weve got an mri weve got a ct  are we sure he wasnt reacting to pain  hes been on painkillers  house come on chase  drugs didnt do this to him even if he is an addict  i dissuade the tonal category  oh please mr sleeping pills amphetamines  bring me up bring me down  announcement will passenger gregory house please report to gate seven  gregory house to gate seven  ever hear this one  you build a house each wall has a southern exposure  big bear comes wandering by  what colors the bear  white its a polar bear you built your house in the north pole  house polar  whatever your name is patient are you bipolar  house what i cant see is he nodding  yes  topamax isnt just offlabel for weight loss  its offlabel for mood disorders  plenty of bipolars are manic in the daytime depressive at night  hes been medicating for years with alcohol sleeping through the bad hours  it explains the danger journalism  it explains everything including the kitchen sink  okay technically its kitchen cabinets  he starts a project then he stops  except bipolar disorder does not cause seizures  house and it doesnt shut down your kidneys but what it does do  guardexcuse me sir may i see your id  house im on the phone guard now please  house what is it  im a doctor this is an emergency call  you have to come with me sir  im not going anywhere  do you think youre gonna take me on  i kick and i bite  youre either on that plane or youre going into custody  foreman house  you still there  being bipolar makes you take risks  you seek excitement you make up stories  i dime valutate a lever  fine maybe your stories are legit but people would start to wonder  annoyed politicians entire governments would be on your ass  so you couldnt tell anybody you were bipolar  which was fine  until you fell in love  and you wanted that life  and you hear that theres a surgical cure  you can give the woman you love the life she wants  all you have to do is change  bilateral cingulotomy  an experimental surgery that some people claim helps mood disorders  and if its done by gamma knife theres no trace of cutting  thats the neural scarring we saw on the mri  which explained nothing because it wasnt even in the right area  its not the surgery its the secrecy  what causes recurring fever  neurological problems lethargy that you fight with caffeine pills and amphetamines  it wasnt your secret psych disorder   it wasnt your secret daily drug use  it was the secret trip for your secret surgery in caracas or buenos aires  which by the way didnt work given the state of your kitchen cabinets  cameron house  shut up  whats going on  is he right  your doctors know you better than i do  that man on the speaker phone he never even met you and he knows you better than i do  you love me  yes yes  you just dont trust me  house get some blood on a slide  do not put it through a computer this time  yep  foreman cerebral malaria  ill get him started on intravenous quinidine  if a human being had actually looked at his blood anywhere along the way  instead of just running tests through the computer  the parasites would have jumped right out at them  the price of the electronic age  greta fletch  shell be back  give her time to miss you  announcement final boarding call for flight no 7  im counting on you to get me off the nofly list  is your patient gonna be all right  physically his chances are good  physically  two people who werent meant to be together  maybe theyll get a happy ending just because they both want it so much  yeah thats usually the way it works  he loved her enough to convince himself he could change  but he couldnt could he  thank you  you know what woody allen said about relationships  irrational and crazy but go through it all because  we need the curry
