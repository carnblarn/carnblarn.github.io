                 down in my heart  i have a joy joy joy joy   down in my heart   down in my heart to stay     do you feel the spirit  all yeah halleluiah  and in the 39th year of his reign  asa was diseased in his feet  until the disease was exceedingly great  yet  he didnt seek help from the lord  but from the physicians  now there is nothing wrong with seeing a doctor  but can a doctor heal through the power that jesus gave his disciples  men of science can walk through life with blindfolds  never knowing that you or i could not take a single step if we were not uplifted by god  agnes  thank you for letting me an instrument of gods love for you  in faith  oh  all things are possible  my friends  i want you to let agnes feel the wave of faith in this church here today  lifting her into gods hands    you can do it come on sister  oh happy day  praise jesus   oh happy day   oh happy day   thank you god  thank you lord thanks be to god  thank you lo  oof  oof oof  no  son  dad i think i need a doctor  agh   original airdate fox 25 apr2006  did you remember my dvd player  well if you wanted it you shouldnt have left it behind when you moved out  now i get it its a drag watching porn on vhs  ill call you as soon as im done with it  thats if you ever get a phone installed  oh forget it  ill come by and get it myself  after work thursday  wont be home thursday  no problem i still have a key i can let myself in and out  i guess maybe i could bring it in tomorrow  after all how many times can you hit pause  at the part where lindsay lohan wins the spelling bee  what is it about girls who can spell  its math contest  what is it about girls who can count  its poker night isnt it    you said weeks ago that i could play   stop making excuses  gotta go  building full of sick people  if i hurry maybe i can avoid them  the abdominal series showed no evidence of obstruction  whatd you have to eat  chicken sandwich we travel lots of fast food  thank you i barely felt it  youre welcome  god told me you were kind  you talk to god  gods presence often descends on boyd to help him guide others  this been going on long  since he was ten  god told me i would meet a woman healer  who was harboring vengeful thoughts about a man she works with  thats gods job  ill keep that in mind   his urine is dilute  what does that mean  it could mean that for some reason his kidneys arent purifying the way they should  which would let toxins accumulate in his body  well run the blood work and see what it tells us  thank you i appreciate it  god talks to him  its not psychosis hes just religious  the only medical issue that showed up on the blood work is low sodium  no you talk to god youre religious god talks to you youre psychotic  a lot of people experience their religion as something more than symbolic   that doesnt mean  god ever talk to you when you where in the seminary  no  gods loss our gain  hes either psychotic or a scam artist  he was actually really impressive  well yeah with the burning bush and all its quite the show  he was intelligent polite dignified hes not a typical 15yearold  and he told cameron god wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article  god  knows you stole camerons article  he knows shes harboring vengeful thoughts  im over it  yeah i can tell that from the berlin wall of body language between you  im shocked that he picked up on it low sodium  check for addisons  no pigmentation and potassium levels were normal  cirrhosis  liver feels fine transaminases are normal   we should monitor his saline intake to correct the low sodium  no more than one meq per liter per hour  and lets push the patient history see if theres any evidence of drugs or other delusions  ill take care of it  youre gonna talk to a patient  god talks to him  itd be arrogant of me to assume that im better than god  so youre a faith healer  or is that a pejorative  do you prefer something like divine health management  i though god might have mentioned that i was coming  im okay withfaith healer dr house  oh thats a nice one  you  didnt even go with  i see an h and a medical coat  the nurses talk about you a lot  ah dont believe them i keep a sock in my pants  faith thats another word for ignorance isnt it  i never understood how people could be so proud of believing in something with no proof at all  like thats an achievement  gods asking for our trust  you cant love somebody and not trust them  trust has to be earned  you cant trust someone hiding in a closet  you dont trust anyone  you seem lucid  theres no confusion no lethargy  what drugs have you been taking  nothing uh some aspirin i  get focused on something i forget to eat next thing you know ive got a hunger headache  so aspirin and hospitals are okay  thats an interesting attitude for someone whos kept any number of people from getting medical help  just because i believe in prayer doesnt mean i dont believe in germs and toxins  that bottles been opened before  you refilled it at the water cooler  yes  how often do you do that  a few times an hour he likes to stay hydrated  you think germs might have gotten in  i think water might have gotten in  we can adjust your pain meds  again  suppose we increase your oxycodone  we both know the only reason im talking lucidly now  is because i did not take my full dose this morning  youve done your best  and i have been a good soldier  its time we accept its over  what about the trip you were talking about taking  youve wanted to see florence since you were a teenager right  yeah go now all drugged up  its not exactly the trip ive been dreaming of  okay but youre strong  youre dealing with this  and there is the right combination of pain meds out there and well find it  dont give up on us  and dont be startled by the sound youre about to hear   excuse me  i have a friend with boundary issues    can this wait five minutes  is she dying  yeah  before the end of this consult  they could build monuments to your selfcenteredness  patient 15yearold faith healer hotline to god   what are his symptoms  he is not a saint  he figures out whats going on in peoples lives by watching listening deducing  and youre worried about trademark infringement  then he passes on advice from god so he can watch them jump its a power trip  ah and there the similarities end why is he here  i fear for the human race  a teenager claims to be the voice of god and people with advanced degrees are listening  the majority of americans believe in a personal god what are his symptoms  massive cramps low sodium  turns out hes been drinking water nonstop god told him to purify his body  huge water intake would cause low sodium  which would cause the cramping yeah i got it  what thats it you solved it  you just brought me out here to rant because faith annoys you  mmhmm hes all better  you know id get it if people were just looking for a way to fill the holes  but they want the holes they wanna live in the holes  and they go nuts when someone else pours dirt in their holes  climb out of your holes people   go tell it on the mountain    over the hills and everywhere    go tell it on the mountain    that jesus christ is born    go tell it on the mountain    over the hills and everywhere    go tell it on the mountain    that jesus christ is born   boyd are you all right   go tell it on the mountain   boyd   over the hills and   come on  lets go can you tell meyour name  do you know where you are  boyd  boyd  god doesnt want you to be afraid  he sent me here to heal you  you think he hasnt heard you prayers but he heard them all even the ones you didnt say  sorry boyd come on lets get you back to your room  in faith all things are possible  lets go  lord  i call on you to relieve the suffering of your daughter   grace  and make her whole again  hey hey what are you doing what is this  hes just had a complex partial seizure  his disoriented he doesnt know what hes doing  well get him back to his roomnow  you okay  are we certain he even had a seizure  hymn singing and healing he does it all the time doesnt he  isnt it interesting  that religious behavior is so close to being crazy we cant tell em apart  the repetition the lack of affect and awareness   it was a seizure  infection  no fever  could be wilsons  or maybe its a glycogen storage disease   or a brain tumor  or tuberous sclerosis  hmm  how to settle this  we could ask our patient to ask god or we could mri his brain  which way do you wanna go   cause im open to all possibilities  house  why the hell do you let an unstable patient wander the hallways  his leash broke  the last thing a terminal patient needs is to hear somebody taunt them with a cure  she was freaked she was angry  and now shes not freaked and angry and you are  she says shes feeling better  maybe not singing and dancing but shes feeling just a little bit happy for the first time in months  sudden drop in pain can create euphoria  you shouldnt let her have her vacation  oh thats great  and when the vacations over when she crash lands from all this denial  she was dealing with her illness  now her expectations are rising  and youre not the one who has to be there when all that false hope gets yanked out from under her  dont you guys have anything to do  how long have you been healing people  you believe thats what im doing  id like to  but you dont  why do you always do things you dont wanna do  its okay i dont expect a real answer  god would probably want you to take that stick out of your butt and get over this  if there is some higher order running the universe  its probably so different from anything our species can conceive  theres no point in even thinking about it  but i doubt it gives a damn about my butt  so you believe god might exist but you dont think about it  its the most important issue  i think penguins might as well speculate about nuclear physics  why are we having this conversation  what im curious  you cannot tell someone they are your colleague and not a friend and then casually chat about the afterlife  you actually keep score  your mri results arent done yet  go back to your room no singing  well you would get a point for figuring why the low sodium  what are my guys points for  your trick about the spat between dr cameron and dr foreman apparently impressed someone  and the second point  do you think it could be because i healed grace  shes  been back to see me i like her  you like messing with people  thats why youre here now  maybe you think that your batteries are powered by god maybe you dont  either way you enjoy what you do  yes  i like helping people  i get a rush when i see the look on their faces when they realize their burdens are gone  mm but you make sure youre in the next state  by the time the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back  that doesnt happen  oh you do extensive followup studies  god told me  see thats not fair we were having fun  its hard to keep sniping rationally when you throw a bomb like that in there  he spoke with me about you too  forgive my enemies  never date a taurus when mercurys in retrograde  yeah i learned that one myself the hard way  god says you look for excuses to be alone  see that is exactly the kind of brilliance that sounds deep  but you could say it about any person who doesnt pine for the social approval of everyone he meets  which you were cleverly able to deduce about me but not being a moron  next  time tell god to be more specific  god wants you to invite dr wilson to your poker game  dont talk to my patient  what are you talking about  you get all huffy when my patient stumbles into yours in the hallway  but you got no qualms about chatting my guy up  this is fun its like password  keep talking ill jump in when i get a clue what the hell youre talking about  god knows about my poker game  you think i told him  either that or i start going to church every sunday  that would mess with my bowling league  house aside from yelling at him to get back to his room ive never spoken to your patient  mri shows an abnormal area  tuberous sclerosis  its the right neighborhood  accounts for all the symptoms  all of them  leading cortical tubers identifiable  we can do this surgically  tell our patient congratulations  soon these chats with god will be a thing of the past  tie goes to the mortal  did you know the catholic church keeps a doctor at lourdes  he hears the same thing every day  but out of the thousands of cases of people who have claimed to feel better  the catholic church has only recognized a handful as miracles  but they do recognize a handful  well theyre a church  its  what they do  look for the past couple of years the worlds been getting smaller  eight months six months  i watch a trailer for a movie  and i think am i gonna be here when that comes out  but maybe there is still a horizon out there  you know maybe  maybe i can make plans for a year from now  two years  i like the view  the view is a lie and if you believe it youre going to crash so hard  let me take new images of your liver  you cant accept that it could be true  well if it is true you shouldnt be afraid of proving it  tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder  it causes small benign tumors to grow in various parts of the body  in this case the brain  you said benign  they probably are but benign or not theyre not in a good location  we need to remove them  youre talking brain surgery  his symptoms are getting worse which means the tumors are growing  surgery will correct it all the chemical imbalance the seizures the auditory hallucinations  hallucinations  without the surgery its just gonna get worse  it might even be fatal  with the surgery your son should be a perfectly normal 15yearold boy  im not normal  i need you to talk to my patient  ill get this one  why do i have the feeling youre plotting world domination  moses is refusing surgery  you have a gift  people thank you for telling them theyre gonna die  if i can get him to agree to surgery i want in on the poker game  you would let this kid die just to get into a stupid game  youd let him die just to keep me out  hi  im dr wilson  i knew theyd send somebody else  that god has a big mouth  house  can i ask why you dont want the tumors removed  god put them there for a reason  you think god needs a telephone in your head to talk to you  isnt he everywhere its not a long distance call is it  this is the way god does things  through natural law if he went around doing big flashy miracles all the time   nobody would need faith  how come everyone else needs faith  but you just get the guy screaming his existence in your ear  your turn  do you think god wants you to die  this is the way that the lord often is with his chosen ones  he gives the most trials to those that he loves the most  how sweet you abdicate your authority  avoid those tricky parental issues like whether to let him drive at 16 just let him die at 15  so you believe your son is um a saint  the way i understand it  one of the hallmarks of a saint is humility  someone with true humility would consider the possibility that  god hadnt chosen him for that kind of honor  hed consider the possibility that  he just had an illness  you have a gift for manipulation  i listen i have an actual conversation with people  which shockingly does raise the odds theyll be cooperative  thats what im saying  you read that kid and you manipulated the hell out of him  bring pretzels  hosue plays what a friend we have in jesus on the piano    i know that knock  use your key im not getting up  games not till tomorrow night  and those arent pretzels  i took some images of grace palmieris cancer  yeah  her tumor has shrunk    dont tell my patient  i want all records on miracle woman  every test every treatments hes ever had  every question shes ever answered in this hospital  and anything sent from previous doctors  go back to neonatal if you have  which part of keep them away from each other confused you  theyre friends  she thinks he saved her life  and weve obligingly offered medical proof that his delusions are true  theyve withdrawn permission for the surgery  ive put the lawyers on it  her tumor shrank  im on it  tell jesus that we need another 24 hours to normalize his sodium level  hes already normalized  actually tell joseph jesusll know youre lying  and i want you and foreman and cameron to go over every line of every file on that woman  isnt he the one were supposed to save  the only way to save him is to prove that she is still dying  mri machine checks out  maybe the radiologist mischarted which machine they used  i checked both this is insane were diagnosing a recovery  what about six months ago  maybe there was a malfunction on her before pictures  some shadow that made the tumor look bigger than it really was  ill go see what i can find out  maybe its a delayed effect from radiation  sometimes it can take a while  she hasnt had radiation for six months   here  nowhere her records  theres about a dozen appliances in every home that give off radiation  dosages that wouldnt hurt a hamster if it was tied to the machine for a year  if the machines operating properly  sometimes remissions just happen  you think house will just shrug and say that if one of us doesnt check the home    kings on 9s  thank you  wilson this is uh dry cleaner tax accountant guy from the bus stop  this is wilson  how comehe gets a name  seniority  hello    find anything  you have any idea how many electrical devices give off radiation  all of them  im gonna be here all night  everybodys a whiner  be a doer not a me tooer  raise  im out  chase shes got at least four different types of pain pills here and an led device  ill raise your raise  keep looking  fold    you were bluffing he knew you were bluffing your lucks changing tonight  so did they find anything  or are you gonna have to accept the fact that every now and then remissions happen    this call had better be worth my time  this is what happens when its not our patient  we dont know enough  thats why youre there  shes got a boyfriend  unless you think hes radioactive  he could show up any minute  the honor of working for you is not worth a felony charge  give me a minute  im saying the odds of you having a straight flush are pretty low  house  ill fold  fold  fold  im screwed arent i    nine bucks for a straight flush  hes not coming home relax  theres nothing in this universe that cant be explained  eventually  take this game  only two people knew that you wanted in on it  i didnt tell him  i told you i didnt tell him  why would you  the only person hes been getting all intimate and conversational with is your cancer chick  how would she know  the subject of my poker game isnt likely to come up in the course of a patient interview  no thats the kind of thing you mention to someone youre used to sharing the details of you day with  dont  your rabbi  a guidance counselor a parent  shes not your mom is she  im seriously saying dont  youve been having sex  this is so not the place  with our miracle woman    excuse me may i may i talk to you  of course  boyds getting dressed hes ready to check out  he cant check out without your permission  his sodium level still isnt normal  i told him he said that god said it was okay he was fine  could you talk to him  tell them my name isnt wilson  most people in your situation just have their careers to worry about  youve got that and divine retribution  tell them  tell me how it happened and ill tell them whatever you want  shed had a bad day painwise  her ride didnt show up to take her home  so you offered  yeah  she didnt have any groceries  she was too sick to go out i  figured i could afford to take a half hour   pick her up and few things  and stay and make sure shes okay  yeah  and never leave  you told me you got an apartment  but you moved in with her  you lied to me  tell them  his name is not wilson and hes screwed up worse than i am  okay yes i lied to you im sorry  half the doctors who specialize in oncology turn into burnt out cases but you  you eat neediness  lucky for you  thanks for the game guys i dont think ill be coming back  youre a functional vampire sure youre heroic useful to society  but only because it feeds you  theres nothing worth stealing so dont even look  you dont just have a fetish for needy people you marry them   here we go  you mean it  and then time passes suddenly theyre not so needy anymore  your fault  youve been there for them too much  theyre getting healthy independent and thats just ugly  god you must be pissed at god right now making her all happy  why are you doing this  because youre being stupid    you know what youre risking by sleeping with a patient  oh thats crap youre not mad because im risking my job  youre not even mad because i lied to you  youre mad because i lied to you and you couldnt tell  yeah you got me nailed  yeah thats why you didnt want me in your poker game  because when it comes to being in control  gregory house leaves our faith healer kid in the dust  and thats why religious belief annoys you  because if the universe operates by abstract rules  you can learn them you can protect yourself  if a supreme being exists he can squash you any time he wants  he knows where i am    i think its yours  yeah  ill be right there  jesus is spiking a fever hes delusional  tuberous sclerosis doesnt cause fever  i know  ill drive  pick any random guy off the street bring him in here  examine him exhaustively you will find at least three things wrong with him  this kid has tuberous sclerosis   a mild case  but his tumors are growing  we assumed that the tumors were growing  cause hes getting sicker but he could have grown old and died  and never known about them if he hadnt come here  we were looking for something that was more or less in the right part of the brain  its like we found someone standing over a dead body holding a gun  we arrested them didnt look any further well sometimes  people really do just stumble into a murder scene  his fever is 103 and rising  if we dont do anything hes gonna be chatting with god face to face real soon  fevers dont come from a longterm underlying condition  hes a garden variety religious nut who happens to have an infection  its lumbar puncture time  no  no god told me no more of mans medicine  if we have faith in him hell make me well  its just a test  we just wanna find out whats wrong  god knows whats wrong god will take care of it  hes delirious and hes a minor this is your decision and not his  the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in field which when a man finds he hides  and for joy he goes and sells all he owns and buys that field  buy all the land you want dont blow your brains out  youre watching your son kill himself hes out of his mind with fever  dad if your faith is weak i will fail  i need you  im sorry  you dont even know whats wrong with him  god knows the answer  and i would rather leave it in his hands than yours  wilson  i need you to do your thing  you do know that i dont actually have magical powers  i have faith  youre better off trying to slip some antibiotics into a meal  which antibiotics we dont know what infection hes got   go as broad as you can  forget it  our best hope is your silver tongue  what if its not an infection  where you not paying attention when i was doing my murder scene metaphor  what if the tuberous sclerosisis guilty  it had the gun in its hand it was standing over  doesnt cause fever  it causes everything else  what if the fevers the innocent bystander  fever could have been set off by something he picked up anywhere  could have been a bug he got here  or a bug he gave here  he gave it to your patient  thats why her tumor shrank the virus went after the cancer first  are you saying a virus attacked her tumor  for 200 years there have been reports of wild viruses that target tumors  early 1900s an italian medical journal wrote up a woman with cervical cancer  who was injected with a weak strain of rabies  i have no idea why they did that but her tumor shrank  you think he gave her rabies  one of the virus types most prone to go after cancer cells is herpes  herpes encephalitis  it would fit  seizure low sodium even the blurred vision  and it would mean if youre right graces cancer is coming back  youre not gonna be able to convince them  they dont want any more tests they dont wanna  they cant argue with the mark of cain  im not gonna change my mind  no more tests god knows the way  okay lets start with his shirt  what are you doing what are you doing  im on a mission from god  if you wont let me undress you then strip  whats he doing whats going on  that woman you helped you gave her a virus  no shes healed i have a gift  a gift is jewelry socks  what you have is herpes encephalitis  the only way you could have transmitted it is by scratching one of your own sores and touching another person  herpes thats something you get from sex right  either that or cold sores your kid got it from the sex  no no sores no my body is clean  they examined me when i came in no sores  herpes hides  you have an outbreak it goes away comes back goes away strip  you didnt have a sore when you came in but youve got one now  dad ive never ever  you ever wonder why a perfect child of god should feel so desperate  to purify his body that he needed to scarf  down a dozen gallons of water a day   boyd is he right  dad no hes crazy  help me dr wilson help  god said no medicine no procedures  taking off your clothes doesnt count as either of those  this ones your call  son  dad you have to have faith in me  i have faith in the lord you i trust  as much as you can trust a teenage boy  take off your clothes  relax  a few hail marys a little acyclovir  youll be picking up angels again in no time  come in  my father told me i have to apologize to you  still hearing voices  youre lucky  you go through life with a certainty that what youre doing is right  i know how comforting that is  good luck  youre not gonna give me my final point  you knew it was me  who else  you dont think god should get a point knocked off   the tumor shrank  because of a virus  do you know what the odds are she had to have the right type of cancer  he had to have the right type of virus the exposure had to be   she won the lottery  you say won the lottery   he says miracle  yeah  the hand of god reached into this kids pants made him have sex so he could scratch a rash  stick his fingers in some womans face give her a few extra months  come on hes just another liar and manipulator  well nobodys as perfectas you are  it is possible to believe in something and still fail to live up to it  so hows your girlfriend  she got a little extra time out of this not a lot  she didnt crash  no she says shes happier when she believes in something bigger than she is  she still believes  faith shes going to florence  you moving out  yeah  moving back in with me  i dont think thats a great idea  but were okay  house you are  as god made you
