                i know that one  i was at the studio when grandfather recorded it  been thinking about your mom  mama everything my whole life  it was all a lie  i never knew you  i never knew you were my dad  your lifes going to be okay leona  youre a good kid you got it together  survived the last eight months on your own  youre not your grandfather  or your mom  youre not going to make the same mistakes they did  im proud that im your father  im glad im getting this chance  ready for a cookie darling  we gotta go get out of here  leona  leona  youve reached a number that has been disconnected and is no longer in service  if you feel youve reached this recording in error go with it hang up  on three one two  house pick up i know its your day off  and youve no doubt got lots of exciting plans  but ive got a case  with cardiogenic shock  but no heart attack  her heart looks fine e r did a full cardiac workup  tox screens clean blood shows no infection  all on the top page im a real good reader  personal chart handoff means theres something else  im hoping its not personal  the guy who brought the girl in says he knows you  i thought id met all your friend  i was also wondering if you could take a look at these  um when you have a chance no hurry  its just a couple of medical histories one with a minor cancer concern  no problem  g man  you thought i was gonna do it didnt you  do i know you  come on its me crandall  doesnt ring a bell  man i cant believe youve forgotten  unless you mean dylan crandall the man wholl believe anything  see i just made you believe that i  you havent changed  heard about your leg  yeah pulled a hamstring playing twister just gonna walk it off  so whos the girl  jesse bakers granddaughter  you always said youd give your right hand to play like him  no i said id give my right hand to have his left  why is she with you  she lost her mom in katrina her home everything  and im her father  hmm yeah she looks just like you got the same fro  i wrote a book about baker hung out with him and his daughter  that is how babies are made  i never knew she never knew  her mom lied for 16 years  thats unbelievable  yeah  no seriously i dont believe it  her mom was pissed at me about my book i trashed her and her dad  she wouldnt talk to me obviously shes not gonna tell leona that  youre a sucker you always were  does that mean youre not going to help her  why wouldnt i  shes not scamming me  acute myocardial infarction  e r said no retest  wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome  e r said no retest and read the damn file  you just gave them to us  delta wave on the ekg its all a no  everything about her heart is healthy  shes a katrina victim  shes better than crandall hes a katrina victim victim  i dont think she was expecting yo sympathy  i think her point was new orleans was a thirdworld country  toxins molds sewage in the streets  what if her heart is like my bike  runs like crap when im by myself but if i take it to the mechanic it runs great  an arrhythmia onetime event  what are we going to do keep her in a room on a cardiac monitor until  she has another arrhythmia that could be weeks months  relax i happen to know shes going to have one right after lunch  we are golden  you cant induce an arrhythmia on someone whose heart nearly gave out 48 hours ago  sure you can  its kind of technical you stick all these cool little wires inside r somehow  i mean you shouldnt  oh right because it would be much more ethical to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting  theres always a team of cardiologists having lunch at the next table this is jersey  shes a minor shes going to need consent  ill go talk to him  oh thats an excellent plan  give him the form and tell him its wrong and dangerous  i can handle a simple consent form  okay  ill be crandall  dr cameron  house from what you say this guy will trust are you in this scene  go  i need to talk to you about a procedure wed like to do on leona  like to do  is this fun for you  hes not you hes not going to mock me  stay in character  im so scared hold me  in order to figure out which circuit is misfiring  we need to map all the electrical activity in her heart  swear to me on the bible youd do this if it was your kid  goodbye  to map the electrical pathways in her heart  we send electricity through each one at a time until one fails  that sounds dangerous  its a risk i am prepared to take  if shes got an electrical problem couldnt more electricity blow her whole system  well look whos been watching bill nye the science guy  test is perfectly safe we do it every day  and you believe me  i shouldnt do the test  its crazy dangerous  just sign the damn form  im not crying i can handle this  then blow your nose  i need dna from somewhere  youre not running a paternity test  shes gonna stay around just long enough to get your bank account  your credit card numbers then shes going to be off with her next daddy  with what shes been through why would you assume  because of what shes been through  because thats your default position always has been  because shes still alive  raised by a junkie living on the streets that tends to kick the sweetness out of you  i figured youd have mellowed  because youre an idiot  if i let you do the test it means i dont trust her  no it means i dont trust her   heart rhythms normal insert the first catheter  im in  all heart rhythms still normal  havent zapped her yet  send the first electrical pulse  sinoatrial node is normal  next  ive got supraventricular tachycardia  stop the current  is she hallucinating  i v push stat125 adenosine  shes crashing b ps plummeting  foreman is she hallucinating  no normal waves  the av node is not the bad pathway  all that was was a heart attack  reset her so we can find the real problem  charging clear  normal rhythm  chase high right atrium please  her hearts fragile after that last attack chances of tachycardia  you have my permission to blame foreman at any negligence trial  send the electrical pulse  thats the one shes hallucinating  its near the coronary sinus  freeze it  damaged heart muscle gone cryoblation complete  the eegs back to normal no hallucinations  shell be fine by breakfast  interesting reading  those are my top two choices for sperm donors  i wanted your medical opinion on genetics  theyre losers  uh medically or  donor 1284 likes square dancing  no one likes square dancing  five minutes calls himself a healer  loves mozart  im not going dancing with them im looking for healthy sperm  he got four living grandparents  who they are what they do that doesnt matter  im leaning towards 613  oh sure go with the jewish number  positive for the brca1 gene  but his mother was negative which means sos your baby  what about the mediterraneandutch factor on the dads side its not a problem  because his dads mom didnt carry the thalassemia gene  the bigger issue is the jerk and poser genes  this mozart lie people cant like classical music  youre designing a kid a loser kid  hes already getting pummeled at recess  here knock yourself out  go find sperm that can beat up 613s kids  and thanks for your help  pretentiousness is hereditary  just cause they havent found the gene yet  could i have some water please  hello i just need some water  is anyone there  mama  no  a second hallucination means we didnt fix her heart maybe we missed something  her hearts fine if she hallucinated it wasnt caused by her heart  if the screaming the floundering it was a hallucination  what if it wasnt a hallucination  we covered not finished  what if it was an atypical seizure  seizure she saw her mother mothers dead ergo hallucination  anyone want to explain that  his leg hurts walking takes his mind off of it  a flashback  all that wind and rain from the hurricane posttraumatic stress syndrome  why are you so bent on her not having a hallucination  if she did have a hallucination  then the heart problem that we predicted found and fixed was just a gigantic coincidence  his leg always hurts its getting worse  what if the heart isnt a coincidence  and isnt what caused the hallucination  arrhythmia hurts  what if her hallucination was caused by pain  what if she has a disease  that translates pain into a bizarre physiological response like a hallucination  she has an autoimmune disease she needs a crp a rheumatoid factor  i can prove an autoimmune disease in five minutes she needs a pet scan  you cant test for autoimmune in  im proving that her hallucinations are a consistent response to pain  which proves that she has an autoimmune disease  how do you test someones response to pain  easy hurt them  its not going to hurt at all  but we just need to make sure you dont move  i wont  okay give me your arm  i need to check your muscle responses  okay turn it over palm upward  everything okay  yeah  ow what the hell was that  diagnostic test  cerebral cortex responded normally shes not hallucinating  you know hes not your father dont you  hes my dad mama told me  im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you  house leave her alone  come on we both know its a hustle  are the walls closing in  no why are you doing this  spiders coming out of my nose  let me out  house the test is over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  give me your hand no  give me your hand  forget him  hes not the perfect mark because he was the perfect mark  plenty of people got there before you  hes used up tainted pumped dry  shes hallucinating  shes lost everything and youre breaking fingers a new low  diagnoically she needed to be hurt i wanted to hurt her winwin  what i didnt consider was a threshold to trigger the hallucinations  otherwise id have done the fingerbending first instead of stabbing her twice that was cruel  if her autoimmune disease is this advanced usual treatments not going to help  we dont even know which autoimmune disease she has  could be lamberteaton could be graves  good point lets kill them all at once  the only way to do that is to replace her entire immune system  good point lets do that  bone marrow transplant requires an exact match  leona has no siblings  good point  shes all alone poor thing no one in the whole wide world  i asked for this tuned did you get this instrument tuned  if my daughter needs bone marrow why are you looking in a bone marrow registry  because thats where they keep the bone marrow  im her father  how does somebody who believes absolutely anything become a nonfiction writer  test my bone marrow  heres how this is going to end  one day youll be sitting at your computer writing one of your little music books  and your daughter will come home with a big angry policemanwholl throw you in jail  becausedaddy touched my poozle  test me  happy to  just my marrow im not authorizing a paternity test  youre that afraid of the truth  i know the truth  easy lay fays truth was that she needed a bus ticket home to see her sick grandma  you gave her 100 bucks  she bought weed  i know because i told her youd go for the sick grandma story  if our friendship means anything to you  oh come on do you know me at all  if you do the test one of two things happens either youre right or im right  if youre right ill be miserable  and if im right ill hate myself cause i didnt trust her either way i lose  they dont itch not raised  hes had his mmr  no ones sick at school his father took him camping  we caught two spiders  you didnt tell me about the spiders  did you get a new couch  do you think there might be some sort of toxin what color is it  red  is that where you watch your cartoons after you take your bath  fall asleep sometimes  yes bless you  need you now  yes mistress  ill write you a prescription for one of these just wet and apply  you didnt tell anyone else what im doing  not a soul  wilson  cameron maybe you mentioned it to her  no im a really good secretkeeper  i never told anybody that wilson wets his bed  oh you tricked me  part of the protocol for in vitro fertilization is twicedaily injections of menotropins  i cant do it myself  turn around  no clever comments about bending over  not unless you want me to  im just not used to house the professional  i was just thinking about what your mother looked like  since your father obviously chose her for breeding purposes  shut up  natural selection sucks  we pick our mates based on breast size cars they drive  they did autopsies on married couples found a correlation in pancreas size  were hardwired to pick for stupid reasons you have the chance to pick for smart reasons  i think the germans had a similar theory about 60 years ago  im not advocating wiping out entire races im just saying  you dont want to mate with the first plastic cup that buys you a drink  im pretty sure you got that  microbes can be sneaky  thanks  twice a day this is going to be fun  i got it  so why were you friends with this guy  we were 20 years old he had a car  if hed been a woman i would have married him   is he a match  no  lying girl lucked out we found one in the registry  is he the dad   i dont think so  you didnt run the test  said i wouldnt  okay so either you lied or he has  pictures of you being nice  stop the radiation  what the hell is that  i have no idea  lab results on the black ooze youre not gonna believe it  she pooped out of her mouth  the sample contains stool and digested blood how did you guess  because it oozed  if it was in her stomach it would have sprayed  if it was in her lungs she would have coughed this oozed as in squeezed as in reverse peristalsis  whos hungry mexican takeout  in order for digested blood to be in her intestines she had to have internal bleeding  order for whatever was in her intestines to come back up there had to be a blockage  liver failure thered be no proteins to clot the blood so itd leak into her stomach mess up her intestines  which means oops we were wrong because no autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours  we need to do a liver biopsy find out what the real problem is  hey need to talk to you  the good news is she doesnt have an autoimmune condition  so she doesnt need a bone marrow transplant and we were able to stop the irradiation in time  bad news she has potty mouth  her liver is failing which has made her digestive system go in reverse  its actually much worse than it sounds  we need to do a liver biopsy  i dont know whats going to happen when we stick a needle into her liver  she could die right then and there  you need to tell me what to do  no inside information on thione  crandall three days ago you didnt even know this girl  if shed been hit by a bus you wouldnt lose a moments sleep  there are people all over this hospital in just as much trouble and just as not related to you  you telling me i shouldnt care  prepping me to handle it for when she dies  its brown its lumpy  im going to heave all over my desk  chicken mol   i find it very comforting  you defending a man you havent seen in years  to know my friend no matter what will always be my champion my protector  im not protecting him im smacking her  the modesty of a true hero  push me and ill let her die just so youll stop annoying me  heres my theory youre jealous  hes maturing hes accepting responsibility youre emotionally stuck at 17  hes manufacturing responsibility hes not maturing  he hasnt changed at all  so then why do you care  that black ooze we saw  that was a bowel movement  out of her mouth  youre trying to end this conversation by grossing me out  im an oncologist half my patients have their skin sloughing off  why are you so worried about this guy  he was having a rough time with his girlfriend  he was in love he was always in love  wanted to marry her i thought she was flaky  she was sending mixed signals  so you gave him advice and she dumped him  no i told him that i would talk to her  and you blew it  technically  i was doing him a favor she was nuts  stop the biopsy  im right at her liver  its house he says stop  check it out  please tell me you didnt stop the biopsy to play us some tunes  the left hand its very subtle very delicate  this girl is dying  be dying a lot faster if i let you do that obviously unnecessary biopsy now listen  i asked for this tuned did you get this tuned  my god grandpa was an angry drunk if only wed known  heres how to become a great artist  first get miserable  misery drives you to become a great artist  but the art does nothing for your misery which drives you to drugs  which makes you a lousy artist and this is not lousy  you saying he didnt do drugs  not when he played this  something was screwing with his personality  yeah drugs and alcohol dont do that  and that note that he says is out of tune its not  which means that something is screwing with his aural perception too  now what happens when you add all of that to the liver disease which he supposedly died of  too much iron he could have had hemochromatosis thats genetic  unless you can tell me miles davis couldnt play stoned  he played better when he wasnt  i think i mean no one knows for sure  ill get leona a tibc and serum ferritin  we can test this in three minutes  so what is she foreman  lightskinned black chick or darkskinned white chick  not sure can we hear the music again  its too early to see jaundice from her liver  true this is a photograph of leona when she was 13 years old  shes darker now  shes been living on the streets for eight months  no tan line so unless those streets shes been living on are indoor streets  im thinking shes got iron deposits and melanin  both byproducts of hemochromatosis just like granddad used to make  squid exam to calculate the amount of iron in her blood  then treat her with deferoxamine shell be fine by lunch  see i was wrong before about the breakfast  theres the iron lots of it  im not going to get this job am i  its a done deal i knew it the moment i saw you  interviews just a formality  house what are you  lisa cuddy this is patrick linehan  patricks going to be the new intern rotating in my department  i didnt even know you were looking for one nice to meet you  sorry i laugh when im nervous  bet youve been doing that your whole life huh  what kind of medicine are you interested in patrick  cancer infectious disease the big devils  i think that medicine has become too institutionalized  we need to send a message to our patients that were just like them  i mean were all people  were all peoplei like that  shes all hard science facts  i like to know a persons hopes and dreams  what kind of music do you like patrick   actually i  im a mozart man  he says what i feel but cant express  im late for a meeting  see this is why the facetoface interview is so important  you gotta know who youre getting in bed with  get him out of here  deferoxamine is a chelating agent  it binds to the iron so that her liver can get rid of it  once the irons out of the liver its finally evacuated by the body in the form of urine  should be quick and painless   leona crash cart  whats happening  shes not getting any air  ct showed her lungs are swiss cheese  ventilators helping but at this rate her times basically up  we developed a theory hemochromatosis  like good scientists we tested that theory we proved that theory  we acted based on that proof and we treated her  as a result of which she is on the verge of death  is it just me or have we discovered a flaw in the scientific method  walk me through it step by step what is supposed to happen when you give someone deferoxamine  its a chelating agent  and what does the chelating do   removes excess iron from the liver  how  the iron is heavy it gets stuck deferoxamine is like a lubricant  it makes the iron slick so it can move around again  moves around where  its supposed to be discharged through waste  her waste system is a little screwy right now  means the iron cant go where it wants to go  what if it moved to her lungs  and whatevers in her lungs likes iron bound with it started poking holes  what likes iron  oxygen attaches itself to iron which increases her chance of infection  no we started massive antibiotics prior to the radiation  some neurodegenerative diseases like iron  mri was clean no iron deposits on the brain  fungus likes iron  no objections to that one  if a fungus is doing all this shes dead  there are 25 antifungals if we dont know which fungus   when in doubt go broad  the most common is aspergillus  continue to ventilate her lungs  get her on a voriconazole drip and hope she has aspergillus  the process is confidential you violated his privacy how did you even  i looked up loser in the cryobank  you wouldnt go within 100 miles of that idiot and yet youre willing to have his baby  im not looking for a date im tired of looking  cotton ball  i dont care if you marry this guy  date this guy go through his garbage but you should know  genes matter who you are matters  find someone you trust  someone like you  someone you like  listen uh sorry okay   its not what you think  i rub his leg  oh ingrid hi  okay  you feel guilty about stealing the guys girl i get that and im glad its a good thing  but you did the paternity test  and either the paternity test comes back negative and you shove it in the guys face  or it comes back positive and you shut up and your leg starts hurting  or i never ran the test   not what you think  leonas lungs collapsed  the treatments not working weve got the wrong fungus  you can stop she ruined it  three rules for hunting fungus location location location  crandall says she was living at the childrens shelter in ridgeland  okay the one thing we know for sure is she was not living at the childrens shelter in ridgeland  why would he lie about that  he wouldnt  but hed believe her story about the sweet little girl trying to do the right thing  we cant ask leona where she was shes intubated  dont try to talk  youve got a big medical thing in your mouth  just blink if you understand me  fantastic  blink if you lied to crandall about everything  you picked up a fungus somewhere  if you were living at the shelter like you told your new daddy  then i got nothing to go on and you will die  so did you lie to crandall  youre a lousy con artist  first rule of the game is know your mark  once you got crandall to bite on the papa thing you had him  you could have told him that you were servicing alqaeda suicide bombers for crack  and this guy would still have let you pick out the colors in your new room  did you lie to crandall  where were you  and the winner is  oh you read it i just get so nervous at these things   recording studio  she read the book  she knew how much crandall hated that place what went on there  she overplayed her hand  she was desperate if she didnt sell this she was stuck in hell  recording studio doesnt help us medically  recording studios  why are these buildings different from all other buildings  sound proofing absorbs sound also absorbs moisture  where theres moisture a lot of it say katrina moist  zygomycosis only occurs at the highest levels of mold  start her on an iv drip of amphotericin b with colonystimulating factors  shell be fine by  dinner  shes going to be fine  she said shed never go back there  she lied to you  shes your kid get used to it  thank you for the injections  youre welcome  you came all the way up here just to tell me that  no  pretty much normal liver function tests are good  thanks gman  what makes you think youd be a good father  i dont know  feels right feels good  well at least youve got a good reason  feels good is a good enough reason  whats happening  shes choking she cant breathe get him out of here will you  out  quick the curtain  youre breathing on your own chokings normal  i lied to him  i ran a paternity test  your lie  was a bad one  he is your dad  were even  uh your machines broken theres not even a message  house are you there  okay see you monday i guess
