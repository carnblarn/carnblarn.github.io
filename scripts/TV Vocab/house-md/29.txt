                my offers withdrawn you can walk to work  got it youre morally outraged now can we get through this part cause the next parts awesome  how do you rationalise something like this you broke into stacys therapists office  borrowed a key  and stole her treatment notes  nope i made copies  mark is and i quote   withdrawn passiveaggressive wont communicate like he resents me because i can walk  i dont want to hear this  dishes in the sink toilet seat up  meanwhile she cant stop thinking about  i cant read that is she obsessed with a grey horse or me  it says she thinks youre an annoying jerk  its a pet name  heres the kicker  theyre not having sex  doctor cleared him but no liftoff  shes frustrated so shes docblocking me  paperwork seminars meddling with my patients  great now youve got the proof you need just  take those personal psych records to cuddy thatll show her stacys out of control  you ignoring me  while looking for my newspaper efficient huh  kalvin over here   dr wilson i want you to meet my stalker  your waiting room sucks  i am not treating you  what because youre a closetcase  errwere not err together  he is so selfloathing  well weve got to go now so maybe see you after work  no no no ah  nobody can figure out whats wrong with me  well your shirt is gaping at the collar means you lost weight youre flushed  thats fever and youre short of breath  and finally theres the ks lesion on your face  means youre hiv positive youve progressed to fullblown aids  so youre sick because our immune system is shot and someone sneezed on you  am i excused now  brilliant but my immune system is fine  your concentration camp physique begs to differ get your tcell count rechecked  ive already done that  they test for tcell lymphoma  it was negative  all of this will be fascinating to an hiv specialist  now let go of my cane before it becomes your new boyfriend  honey i will marry it if you would look at my file  congress says you cant so      i didnt touch him  hes going into anaphylactic shock   original airdate fox 22nov2005   go see stacy  we gave him epi hes fine  you need a lawyer go see stacy  you hit a patient  four words two mistakes  hes not a patient and i didnt hit him  of course you didnt go see stacy  i didnt cause the anaphylaxis  its probably one of his hiv meds abacavir  ill pass that along make sure the er takes him off it  go see stacy  you have to treat him  medically this case is a snoozefest  aids plus infection  you dont treat him he charges you with assault  just cause he says i hit him doesnt make it true  watch i am surrounded by naked cheerleaders  see  although i like my chances of some action this morning  i forgot wednesday was hooker day this couldve waited  you make me meet you at your house  your husband is conveniently absent  marks at physio  im stuck waiting for the exterminator  i saw a rat last night  well im surprised your feet are touching the floor  i barely slept  what was mark up to  memory serves quick climb up mt gregory and you dozed through a seal hunt  clubbing shrieking  whatre you doing  sorry its driving me nuts  you hate washing dishes  people change  i could make sure you sleep like a baby tonight  rather take care of that myself  i was referring to the rat  trenton pests is sending a guy  mark whats going on  its not what you think  i know it looks like were cleaning dishes but actually were having sex  were working  wow wish id become a doctor  place would be spotless  take ten minutes cure the guy and stop whining  i give you kalvin ryan  so flamboyant in person so boring on paper  obviously got an opportunistic infection probably tb or pcp  have you read his file  i started but i found the characters twodimensional  he went to a hiv clinic last week  tested negative for tb pcp mac cmv hsv  its not an infection  hiv clinic so few patients so much money redo the tests  the results make sense  kalvins tcells are at 200 thats strong enough to fight infection  fine parasite  nope stool sample was negative  two months ago he was down to 30 tcells then he changed his meds  his immune system rebounds his viral load drops  everythings getting better but hes getting sicker  face it this might be an interesting case  what if his immune system is too strong  an autoimmune disease with hiv thats impossible  his new hiv meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep  wakes up hungry cranky spoiling for a fight  when it doesnt find an active infection  starts attacking the harmless remnants of old infections  immune reconstitution syndrome  his meds made him so much better he made himself sick   sounds pretty  boring  this is so not interesting  chest xray and find the old infections start him on steroids  if youre wrong steroids will tank his immune system hell get worse  now that would be interesting  wheres the coumadin  if your patients got a blood problem then blood thinners arent exactly  its for stacys rat death by anticoagulation  trying to win stacy back by killing an animal  very caveman  i dont want her back  i just want her to admit her feelings for me  i go to cuddy cuddy fires her or reassigns her either way im happy  if you want her back either tell her or better yet shut up  and cry yourself to sleep like everybody else  hi this is mark warner  listen you dont need to send that guy down we caught him  no you should send the bill to princetonplainsborough hospital  attn dr james wilson  yeah  your lymph nodes rent swollen thats good  maybe dr chase should check  sorry mate hands full  hes too pretty to be straight you ever done any modeling  does anyone actually fall for that line  everyday why do you think i became a photographer  im guessing you guys didnt think about dating on career day   i love my job  really  you seem more the find it exceptionally satisfying type  im not sure theres a difference  your mom died of diabetes hows your dads health  last i heard he had cirrhosis  love is love satisfying is social validation fun can wait  i have fun  yeah shes got some scheduled for february  chase last you heard your father  he threw me out when i was 16  its just as well i got tired of getting bb guns for my birthday when id asked for a barbie  dads can be real sweethearts  mmm sensitive and cute  hes cute  it ran into that heating vent right there  hopefully marks anger will go away eventually  hes not angry just doesnt like you  nothing unique there  didnt seem really wild about you either  hes fine with me  hes angry said so in group  of course hes angry hes looking at months of painful physio   hes mad at you  theres no way he said that   no but its true  he resents you for being able to walk  ive been there  i resented you for hell of a long time  past tense    might be the hospital  what   bad time where are you  hosue at your girlfriends place ignore the moaning and squeaking  his lungs are too scarred to tell which infection triggered the immune reconstitution  he a smoker  cameron yes and possible more than cigarettes  his tox screen came back positive for recreational drugs  house not surprising not medically relevant  his heart looks a little enlarged  house thats a typical sideeffect of azt  house what are kalvins most recent infections  toxo cmv and pcp     well lets assume its one of those  house give him ganciclovir for the cmv  woah we can hardly hear you where are you  house in a closet your girlfriends other boyfriend showed up  ganciclovir for the cmv  sulfadiazin for the toxo bactrim for pcp  gotta go its killing time  cameron your tox screen came back positive for  crystal meth andecstasy  recreational drugs are dangerous to begin with but for someone with hiv  i didnt mistake them for vitamins   im a pp boy  party and play  drugs and sex    you dont approve  does the sex include condoms  if hes negative sure if hes positive  why put on a raincoat if youre already wet  you could get hepatitis or another strain of hiv  or i could get hit by a bus  aids isnt a death sentence anymore  i dont want to have any regrets    how long have you been coughing  ahabout an hour or so   try to take a deep breath    what is it  i think its blood    i recommend postexposure prophylaxis  your chances of conversion are slim  but id like to put you on three antiviral medications  finavir zidovudine and lamivudine  there are sideeffects headache nausea vivid dreaming  youll be tested for hiv in 6 weeks 3 months 6 months  very interesting  he coughs infected blood in camerons eyes and mouth thats interesting  the coughing part not the in cameron part  new symptom blood vessel ruptured in his lung  i closed the tear  well it takes immune reconstitution off the table  whats it put on the table  its ok shes not here you can skip the nice guy acts  you know some human beings are actually capable of human feelings  my giving a damn or not is not going to change what happened  could be kaposis syndrome  no edema no blood in urine  ks on his face could mean ks in his lungs with bleeding from the lesions  i would have seen them when i repaired the tear in his lung  wegeners granulomatosis  wegeners would have responded to the steroids  maybe you should go home take the rest of the day  im fine  oh this is good hes pretending to care youre pretending not to  i think we should reconsider drugs kalvin uses crystal meth  concerned enough about his health to stalk me  while indulging in deadly street drugs  study in contradictions  interesting still not medically relevant  it could be if his drugs were tainted  they cook meth with battery acid lye lantern fuel  find kalvins pills test for toxins  foreman youre with me  i need a consult on another case  you have another case  its a hippocket deal  patient presents with a distinct neck tilt   is he an athlete  hes a regular runner  any pain associated with movement  none that hes complained of  best case scenario an infection in the ear or lungs  worst case brain stem tumour  should do an mri cat scan full workup  uhhi dont think so  no insurance  no drugs in here ill take the bathroom  how about a drink after work take your mind off what happened  cameron  i might have hiv a drinks not going to wash it away  theres like zero chance of you contracting the virus  big difference between like zero and zero  what did the infection control guy tell you  he was very reassuring kept reminding me that the hospital covers all my medical costs  apparently forgot to mention that if i do test positive  that theyll pass it on to legal and legal will dig up any dirt they can trying to prove that im a  drug user or tramp and thats why i have hiv  its not like theyre going to find anything right  right  check this out  chase kalvins a photographer the broken bulbs were props  glass is from  some of the bulbs have date stamps  preworld war ii fluorescent bulbs contained large amounts of beryllium  beryllium dust inflames the lungs they get rigid patient cant breathe  my father coauthored a paper on acute berylliosis  phew for a moment there i thought you were smart  cameron get a biopsy of calvins lung tissue  i want a spectrographic analysis  i can handle it  no reason to risk exposing the entire team  then who would i torment  im sorry  about what happened  its best not to talk  youre going to feel a sharp pinch  this actually is going to grab a piece of your lung  what were you guys looking for at my hotel  your drugs thought maybe youd used toxic meth  well know if youre exposed to beryllium in a few hours  well if youre still curious its in my bag over there on the chair  you brought drugs into the hospital  glad i wasted my time at your hotel  i told you i used you didnt ask me for a sample  youre not pissed about this youre mad because i coughed blood on you  that was an accident  oh would you stop being nice its useless and worse its boring  get angry i had one stupid night i end up with hiv  do you have any idea how pissed off i was  this wasnt your fault  you broke into my house  why i had to mark isnt here  he has physio  oh really hows he doing  what happened with all the cheese  i had to get rid of it before steve mcqueen ate any coumadin  i named your rat  steves tilting his head  any neurologist will tell you that suggests an infection or brain stem tumour  death cures both those things  well we cant kill him  if its an infection it could be caused by something in your house  something that could affect you guys  smell this     does it smell like urine  oh    you missing any asparagus  ok stuff these he doesnt get better then its a tumour  then what chemo  steve mcqueen without hair  its a blessing he died young    hello  oh hi honey im sorry i missed you yeah i came home  alright ill see you in a few minutes  okay bye hun  chest hurts   hes a hundred and climbing could be an allergic reaction  neck pains are out must be pericardial effusion  no wheezing  tear in his lungs must have reopened  kalvin youre bleeding into the area around your heart  im dying i cant breathe  the bloods crushing your heart once we remove it youll be fine  if i die please tell my dad  youre not going to die  tell him sorry    wheres the blood  its clear  only one other thing could cause this  tumour in his heart  wilson ct confirmed a mass in kalvins heart and several smaller ones in his lungs  thats why his hearts enlarged not the azt  you ok  shes fine probably getting bored with the question  masses in the heart and lungs what kind of cancer are we looking at  they may not be cancerous  this is classic nonhodgkins lymphoma  hiv positive patient with a primary heart mass  it could be sarcoidosis  his lung tissue is negative  lymphomas a death sentence sarcoidosis is treatable  sos an ear infection but since he didnt test positive for that either  i wanna do the kveimsiltzbach test   do you have any idea how much paperwork cuddy is going to need signed  do it  so  how is the patients father  uh  tell my dad im sorry  might as well wave the red flag at a bull  hes not coming  well its not a tragedy  dad doesnt want to see him he doesnt want to see the dad  youre the only one who wants them together   he asked  he thought he was dying  dying people lie too  wish theyd work less theyd been nicer theyd opened orphanages for kittens  if you really want to do something you do it you dont save it for sound byte  what did you say when you thought you were dying  on the other hand  his dad tossed him out  so whats our guy want to apologise for  everybody has regrets  cameron the growths in your lungs and heart are sarcoid  your body will recognise this material  and well see a reaction on your arm  did you really want to see your dad  did you call him  thanks  he would have come try to straighten me out  how are you holding up   im fine  convincing  what did you do with my drugs  the lab disposes of them after analysis  too bad  they could have done you some good  not really my thing  you know i hope you dont have it but  getting hiv might have been the best thing that ever happened to me  i used to be a good boy  never wanted to piss anybody off  playing by the rules makes everybody else happy  now im happy  so you just show up every time hes at physio  off course not also when hes at group therapy or out for dinner with friends  and when she happens to mention to mark that you dropped by  you tell your wife everything  its a process   but stacy doesnt have any reason to hide this from mark  as far as she knows marks okay with you being there  my bet is she mentions me to mark as little as possible  cause she thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me  and you know why she thinks that  because she still has feelings for you   if youre right she did tell him and i dont get through the door tonight  but if im right  so how long do we stay here  til something happens  hes not going to come out with us right here  we are downwind and he seems to have hearing loss  hes not blind  steve mcqueen does not run from danger  antibiotics on the other hand  he ate around the pill smart  admit it you like him  hes alrightfor a rat  you wanna know how cool he is  his urine showed traces of hydrogen cyanide formaldehyde lead  hes a smoker  your husbands been lighting up  which is particularly stupid it could cause his aip to  okay i blow my smoke into the vents so mark doesnt know  i always knew it  bluffing  you started two weeks after my surgery  menthols then lights after a month  why didnt you say anything  cause it helped me monitor your misery level  one trip outside was a good day upwards of six you were in hell  you could have asked me how i was  i already knew  sorry you were miserable  sorry i caused you so much pain      aha     glad you changed your mind about that drink  come on in  you should get changed theres this new place on campus that   are you high  uh huh  i thought you disposed of the drugs  not all of it  uhh slow down  your pupils are dilated  come on chase dont turn into a good guy on me now  youre late and hungover  or maybe not  why do you have a rat  jealous   kalvin  out of my room dont you dare put this on me  kalvin im not going to grovel dad  thats not what im asking for  like hell it isnt you said you didnt call  dont mind me just here for the show  yeah well theres not going to be any  what happened to the big apology yesterday he was all daddy im so sowwy  this is none of your business  you should have thought of that before you stalked me  now im interested  so whats he got to apologise for youre the one who tossed him out  now why would i do that  i dont know cause its tough to brag to your hunting buddies  that your son knows all the words of the whiz  thats a lie   42nd street  oh tchick  much easier to just get drunk and beat him explains his hating you  also your cirrhosis  also why the more i talk the more you sweat  what it doesnt explain is why hes gotta apologise to you  residual guilt for sharing your special toy with other boys  just leave it alone  just want to leave the bigot with some peace of mind after youre gone  look this has got nothing and i mean nothing to do with him being gay  now kal brought this on himself with what he did to his mother  he steal her signature look  no no he killed her  kalvin lied  yeah that certainly is shocking  moms kidneys were failing she needed a transplant they tested kalvin he was a match  he was also positive for hiv mom never found a qualified donor she dies  tragic tale  undercut slightly by the rapid fire delivery and constant movement  too much coffee this morning  he didnt kill her our bodies arent donor farms for our parents  its not 1980 we know how hiv is transmitted  if kalvin got hiv through unprotected sex dad has every right to be pissed  so you always use a condom  uhh yeah  brothers on the downlow got to  huh not ready for any foreman juniors yet  you  working girls are sticklers  youre not going to pull chase  im not an idiot  obviously not  who doesnt sleep with a drugged out colleague when they have a chance  wheres wilson  we got the result for the kveim test    so i have cancer  in all likelihood yeah  nonhodgkins lymphoma  and i am dying  we need to biopsy the tumour its near your aorta so  getting that sample carries serious risks  is my dad still here  he hasnt been in  well inject a dye around your heart to make the tumour visible on the ct  then a surgeon inserts a guide wire runs it up into your heart  where he takes a small piece of that tumour so we can look at it under the microscope  chase ativan will help settle you down  why are you so calm  not coming off meth helps  last night probably shouldnt happen again  do you think i want it to  when two people have had sex unless it sucks  if they can do it again theyre gonna do it again  and thats when things get complicated  and it didnt suck  so now youve got to drum up another excuse to be around the love of your life  could hit another patient  nyah dont like to repeat myself people will say im formulaic  well that rules out letting the rat go so you can catch him again  i cant do that  steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smokefree environment  cigarettes aggravated his infection  the rat is actually sick  that thing could infect the entire hospital  steves infection is not contagious to humans  im an idiot how did i miss micoplasmosis was that the kids father  yeah remember the black death started with rats  whats he doing in the hallway his kid getting his biopsy already  he just wont go in the room  who knows what else he has parasites bacterial infection   kid doesnt have parasites  not the kid the rat  was he still sweating  rats only sweat through their tails  not the rat the dad  where are they from  errmontana whats going on  you were right its a parasite  cancel the biopsy itll kill him    hey daddy come with me  yeah uhh im not going in there    your son asked to talk to you  why is he here  he wanted to talk to you  aha  did you two use to hunt together  foxes did you kill foxes  its montana  those masses in your chest are not tumours  theyre parasitic cysts from a bug called equinococosis  touch a dead fox they jump aboard they can hunker down for decades   growing spawning shopping putting on plays  ive been tested for parasites  okay its cancer you happy  the cysts isolate the parasites  keeping them from showing up in stool samples even in blood tests cardiac  all right you dont need me for this  but youve got the same things in your liver  i have cirrhosis  liver cysts have identical symptoms with one addition fever  now liver cysts we can test for  your diagnosis could confirm kalvins  so option a we draw some blood  no look youre not touching me  you see this is why i need you here  i want you to tell your son that you wont take a simple painless blood test to save his life  you err never expressed a shred of regret for what happened to your mother  geez dad  dad if youdve worn a damn rubber youdve been fine  dad could have saved her life you wouldnt be lying here  house yeah yeah yeah i get it  youre really mad at him for killing himself and for destroying everything you love  i dont have time for this are you going to apologise  im living my life the way i want  are you going to give me some blood  look if he doesnt give a damn then neither do i  okay option b  why did your wife kill herself did she hate you  she was a diabetic  you know you dont know a thing about my suzanne  either suzanne wanted to die or she was both fat and stupid  used a twinkie instead of a gun  and girls with big appetites well they just cant get enough of anything  shut up  probably nibbled on every devil dog in the county  shut up  just in case im not making myself clear i dont mean the delicious snack  you son of a bitch  yeah come on  thank you means i can do this  were going to need some epi in here stat  are you out of your mind  you said you didnt care    notice how you cant breathe  now either thats the cane  or i just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about  and youve gone into anaphylactic shock  exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friends car  im just so excited to find out which    im gonna schedule surgery  nurse clamp  surgeon pressures holding  two successful surgeries two lives saved  im over my quota can i have next week off  two family members assaulted   it was self defence  you baited him  youre right i was asking for it  the lowcut blouse the dome pumps  you flooded his gut with a parasite he could sue  go see stacy  okay  thats it okay no namecalling no squawking no rending of garments  i like this tshirt  you lied to me  if this is about my mom  this is about your lonely miserable life  im not miserable  and as long as theres a gay bar around im never lonely  you havent had a single visitor except for your dad  drugs are great hiv freed you  your dad hates you youre so happy  everythings a lie  you blame yourself for your moms death  youre not trying to have fun youre trying to selfdestruct  you wanna kill yourself fine but stop recruiting  heard you hit another patient  yeah sure why not  he hit me first  cuddy didnt mention that let me see  im the doctor  my concern is purely legal  looks okay does it hurt  a little  you need some ice  theres no way that mark doesnt know  about the smoking  he would have said something  then he hasnt been near you in months  were fine  cant be easy  stop squirming  why would you lie about this  im not lying  i dont care if youre sleeping with him or not but youre not so  i am  youre lying  you know when i have sex you can smell that on me too  the only people who know about whats going on between me and mark are me and mark  i just know you  and i know you  youre confident arrogant but youre never certain unless theres a reason to be certain  one other person knew i told you i was seeing dr harper  you can easily get into her office you read my file  you read my file  the dishes the concern the oh  acting like a human being  you have  this whole time youve been manipulating me  you knew that i had an angle the moment i poured soap on to a scrub brush  you could have thrown me out  or ignored me or found another exterminator  you didnt even tell mark that i kept coming by  you let this happen because you wanna be with me  i dont know anymore  get out    im sorry   yesterday i got lost in the circus    feeling like such a mess    and now im down im just hanging on the corner    i cant help but reminisce    i know we all we all got our faults    we get locked in our vaults and we stay    when youre gone    all the colours fade when youre gone    no new years day parade youre gone    colours seem to fade    colours seem to fade
