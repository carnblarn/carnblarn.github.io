                 radiologist contact 5317  radiologist contact 5317   amber  no  why not ambers a stripper name  find me one stripper named amber hartig  or not okay  nonstripper names um desiree   bambi kandy kane  max  maxine  max hartig its a cute name isnt it  if youre a professional boxer maybe  can you believe we made this little creature  i know its incredible its the most amazing thing weve ever done  i almost ran the marathon last year  if were lucky you wont inherit your daddys sense of humor  hello say hi to bear    she hasnt even eaten anything why is she spitting up  well honey we cant bug them again could you  okay okay  im sorry its our first kid were both a little panicky i guess  well you gotta ask the pediatrician next time i just deliver em   is she spitting up  yeah second time in an hour  oh if you lived underwater for nine months  youd have a lot to spit up too  is something wrong a little lethargic    well we didnt think  shes hot     is she uh  the babys seizing get the crash cart   whatswhats wrong  need some help in here  oh god is she all right     i v access  no ativan  whats going on   the mris back  and its what we expected  the accident caused serious damage  its amnesia   im sorry   i just cant believe it    enjoying our lounge house  just came in to get milk for my coffee which youre out of   flat or sparkling  sparkling  splat  so the hartigs  their baby gets a fever what dont tell me the kid had a seizure  yep the parents of course start freaking and i have to deal with that for an hour  like it was your fault she was perfect when i delivered her  if you wanna blame someone blame the pediatrician so how is the kid now  bowel obstruction shes under observation shell be fine  the pediatrician will take all the credit   exhibit a baby girl hartig  term baby 42 hours old  went into seizures six hours ago brought into the intensive care  diagnosed with obstruction of the small bowel  im still amazed youre actually in the same room with a patient  people dont bug me until they get teeth  exhibit b baby boy hausen  another term baby 48 hours old  brought into the nicu three hours before the hartig baby  fever of unknown origin  wow that is amazing  you hung out in the obgyn lounge all morning and heard about two sick babies   its its eerie  dont touch that  all right we have an infection spreading in the hospital   these kids have totally unrelated illnesses  they fell sick within four hours of each other  they had the same delivery rooms maternity rooms are neighboring so transmissions possible   they have the same symptoms  the hartig girl has a bowel obstruction  no matter how close their beds are im pretty sure kids cant share a blockage  what does bowel obstruction on a chart indicate  normally id say it indicates a patients bowel is obstructed  but im pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart  it means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the patients bowel is obstructed   okay youre upset because they threw you out of their lounge  look at the xray  its a normal gas pattern if you want i can get you a key to the oncology lounge  air in the colon were getting tivo  if its air no bowel obstruction  even if it is air it could have been there before the obstruction  no somethings infected both these infants    and youre the only one who put this together because  because im the only one who looked at both kids  i want them isolated i want the maternity ward shut down  because youre better at reading an xray than a radiologist  radiologists always overread babies xrays especially if theyre asked to rule out a pathology   he read into it what he wanted  which is exactly what youre doing  youre finding a cluster because you think its interesting to find a cluster  two plain old sick babies would bore you  see this is why i dont waste money on shrinks  cause you give me all these really great insights for free  shrink if you would consider going to a shrink i would pay for it myself  the hospital would hold a bake sale for gods sake  we have an epidemic  two sick babies is very sad but it doesnt prove an epidemic  how many do  get up were going hunting  for what  wabbits    hi bye  hes screaming hes fine  goodlooking baby  oh sorry wrong room well see you later  twelve rooms right thats it  yep weve definitely checked the whole floor  good news no epidemic  tragic huh  overflow rooms third floor  this imaginary infection has spread to the next floor  we were just gonna call did he get hot all of a sudden  yeah    yeah ill take care of that for you   almost there honey dont worry were almost there  excuse me hi hi  intake sent you up here yeah my wifes contractions are less than  okay intake messed up i am very very sorry  nurse alpert will arrange for an ambulance  to take you to princeton general   the maternity ward is temporarily closed we have to leave  yes i am very sorry why are you doing this   you will be there very very soon  happy now no  but i am interested  three sick babies and a fourth showing early symptoms   how bad  spiking fevers  bps plummeting theyre barely able to keep systolic up   at this rate they could be dead in a day  where did this come from  two delivery rooms four different maternity rooms no common personnel and no common equipment   theres got to be something in common  yeah  that would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence  im putting a team together were gonna start swabbing  whats she gonna swab every respirator sink vent drain in the entire hospital   thatll take months  needle in a haystack  its worse than that we dont even know its a needle were looking for   then whyd you let her go do it  because the hospital is her baby and her babys sick  if she doesnt solve this soon her heads gonna explode and i dont want to get any on me  so lets figure out whats in the haystack   differential diagnosis people  parasite   its spreading too quickly  next   virus  the kids are too sick and the blood tests showed no lymphocytosis  and theyre not responding to acyclovir or ribavirin  if its some other virus well never find it in time anyway  which leads us to bacterial infection  its not responding to broadspectrum antibiotics so weve got something resistant   the usual suspects  mrsa its always mrsa in hospitals  maybe contaminated food or water source  pseudomonas  vre h flu  okay those are the big ones  cultures will take 48 hours might as well be postmortem  well start them on vancomycin for the mrsa and aztreonam to cover the rest  lets get mri s check for abscesses or some occult infection  ill be in the clinic grab me if you find something important or unimportant         we did an mri on all the babies and unfortunately we didnt find anything  so were starting them on the strongest antibiotics that weve got  and were hoping that that will take care of it  but hes so tiny  how sick is he  his fevers up to 1035 and his blood pressure is 80 over 40  how um how bad is that  uh  itits low the heart needs to circulate the blood  if its weak the oxygen isnt getting to the liver the kidneys the brain  um i have to ask you something  judy no no kim let me  um i had a cold last month and i told the doctors about it  honey this has nothing to do with you  kims right  your son was born healthy  he caught the infection after his birth  theres no reason to think that he caught it from you  but you dont know i mean you dont know how he got sick  pretty standard question how sick is my child you couldnt answer  i answered you rattled off numbers bp o2 sats  its not what they need to know what they need to know is the future you got a magic 8 ball  no just eight years of medical training  look i realize its tough to break bad news to families  not as tough as hearing it  and i guess being the poor guy dying is the toughest of all  no  its easier to die than to watch someone die   well were checking the vents it could be airborne  somebody get the sinks too and underneath them  ill get it  how many med students have you got swabbing the decks  what else are they gonna do its not like theyre delivering babies  you find anything yet uh yeah  about half the antibacterial gel dispensers are empty or broken  thats bad yet diagnostically completely insignificant  well if the staff cant wash their hands its no wonder an infection has spread  hey tie clip sorry  we have an epidemic in this hospital and your tie is becoming a petri dish  put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off   myjoints have been feeling all loose and lately ive been feeling sick a lot  maybe im overtraining  im doing the marathon like 10 miles a day but i cant seem to lose any weight  lift up your arms  you have a parasite  like a tapeworm or something lie back and lift up your sweater  you can put your arms down  can you do anything about it only for about a month or so  after that it becomes illegal to remove except in a couple states  illegal but dont worry  many women learn to embrace this parasite  they name it dress it up in tiny clothes arrange playdates with other parasites   playdates  it has your eyes  but thats impossible  well i assume you werent getting your period  maybe that should have given you an inkling  but im on this birth control implant yeah i know  i saw the scar on your arm and my doctor said i might not get any periods at all if it was working  mmhmm interestingly enough you also dont get any periods if it isnt working  which is why you were supposed to get regular pregnancy tests  oh im gonna send a nurse in here to schedule your prenatal care  youre due in about five months so start planning the shower  um doctor  please me and my husband wanted to have a kid soon  but oh god  like four months ago we had this really big fight  he moved out i did something stupid  onenight stand exboyfriend  well ill schedule you a paternity test too  i cant let my husband know  does the old boyfriend look like your husband  yeah  then just have the kid hell never know  the most successful marriages are based on lies  youre off to a great start  well you look cheery whats going on  the hartig and chenlupino babies their kidneys are shutting down  and the urine tests show no casts  which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure  youre the nephrologist which one did it well take em off that one   dont tell me both vancomycin and aztreonam  they both can cause this  theres no way to know which one it is no test  we cant take em off the antibiotics though theyll die of the infection  if we leave them on both the antibiotics theyll die of kidney failure  so we take our best guess then which drugs causing the kidney failure  its like i said its always mrsa in hospitals take them off aztreonam  i still think its the pseudomonas i vote to take them off the vancomycin  theres no point in guessing  take one kid off vancomycin the other off aztreonam   they have the same disease you want to give them different treatments  what the hell are you doing   therapeutic trial to find the cause of the infection  thats wrong  we have four sick kids at least   who knows how many more havent started showing symptoms yet  we have a duty to these two  if these two have different reactions well know how to save the rest  so youre condemning one of these kids to die based on random chance  i guess i am     so youre going to flip a coin  thats how you decide which baby lives  can i borrow a quarter  do you want to get sued lose your license house  well generally id applaud that but my job is to protect this hospital  so i strongly advise you to come up with a medical rationale  why baby ashould get medicine x and vice versa  whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on there slick we didnt all go to law school  your advice is that i should use medical reasons to make medical decisions hmm thats not gonna be as easy  any medical justification it doesnt need to be a good one  well hartig sounds jewish so does aztreonam so well take the hartig kid off vancomycin  hows that   you cant experiment on babies  doctors experiment all the time   on adults with their consent  fine ill get the parents consent  their informed consent they have to know the other kid is getting a different treatment  sorry cant do that it would be unethical for one patient to know about another patients treatment   they have a right to know  if they know they wont consent that defeats the whole purpose  thats their right  two more babies have just become symptomatic  i defer to your legal wisdom  which takes precedence six dying babies or a missing consent form  you cant do it  do what you think is best  your daughters kidneys are shutting down  your sons kidneys are failing  so were going to take her off the aztreonam  were taking him off vancomycin  uh but what what made her sick in the first place   what do you think is causing it  it seems to be a germ called pseudomonas  we think its mrsa methicillinresistant staph aureus  its a very resistant form of a very common bacteria  were hoping the aztreonam will clear it up  vancomycin is the best treatment for mrsa so were gonna keep giving it to her  is it gonna cure her  your child is very sick you need to know that  this is a hail mary pass it might cure her it might not  soso thatll cure him  well know in 24 hours if its working  what did you tell them i told them the truth  they seemed relieved did you tell them how sick their son is  i explained what was going on allison their babys dying  if the parents werent in tears by the time you left you didnt tell them the truth  thats not how i see it do you want them blindsided  want them coming up and saying my god my baby died why didnt you warn me  so now its about worrying about them yelling at us no  its about getting them prepared for the likely death of their child  if their son dies tomorrow you think theyll give a damn what i said to them today  its not gonna matter theyre not gonna care nothings gonna be the same ever again  just give those poor women a few hours of hope  dr house oh no  dr house this is my husband charlie  who told you where my office was  jill come on he obviously doesnt want us bothering him  ooh i was trying to hide it  look doctor this is about the mono that you said you thought i had  the mono yes  you know shouldnt charlie be tested  you know the test the blood test  right  yeah im sorry l i sometimes forget patients  i thought you were this idiot who doesnt know how to use birth control  i cant have mono i dont even feel sick or anything  thats very often the first sign  call my office in the morning and ill schedule you for blood tests  thank you  im not even tired oh  find anything yet  oh just some baby formula being stored under a sink with a dripping faucet  tap water contamination you thinking pseudomonas infection  i was i wasted a couple of hours chasing it down  but of course the formula hasnt been anywhere near the babies  huh whatever idiot stored them there  all right well figure it out justjust calm down  i am calm let me know when youre gonna need it  oh come i warned you  i did that calmly  hey hi  she any better  uh her fever has been stable the last hour  were not gonna make it are we  sorry  me and ethan  our nextdoor neighbor  her little boy died in a car crash  and she and her husband split up like four months after the funeral  its just uh what always happens right  uh what happens to patients after they leave the hospital i dont know  but try not to get ahead of yourself     dr chase activity on the monitor  how long i dont know it just started  pulse fluid wide open  do we have an arterial line not yet  lets get a bp  you cant come in here is my baby dying   mrs hartig  is she dying  maam youll have to leave  its not your baby  ventilate  bp 60 over 20  heart rates 180 start the levophed   still dropping   i cant hold bp even with three pressors  im losing pulse   vfib  shut the blinds  charging set  clear  still vfib  charging clear  charging clear   still vfib  charging clear   charging  chase    time of death 657 pm     the aztreonam doesnt work  doublecover all the other babies with vancomycin  ill do it   cameron tell the parents  tell them their child probably saved five lives   but chase should  chase is busy  youre the attending  make sure she does her job    i asked you to make sure she does her job not do it for her  she froze up she felt sorry for the parents so she shut up  you felt sorry for her so you opened your mouth she has a problem  she needs to deal with it if you hadnt bailed her out she would have done it  great then she wouldnt have slept for two weeks  maybe she should be thinking about a different specialty  lab work research   yeah what is it  the hartig baby shes getting sicker too  the vancomycin isnt working either  vancomycin doesnt kill it aztreonam doesnt kill it  what the hell is this  its a superbug it could be vrsa  theres only been two reported cases ever in the united states  one of the kids the hausen baby had a skin rash  it could be scaldedskin syndrome which would be a sign of vrsa then these kids are dead  this is our fault  doctors overprescribing antibiotics  got a cold take some penicillin  sniffles no problem have some azithromycin  is that not working anymore well got your levaquin  antibacterial soaps in every bathroom  theyll be adding vancomycin to the water supply soon  we bred these superbugs  theyre our babies and theyre all grown up  and theyve got body piercings and a lot of anger  on the other hand maybe antibiotics had nothing to do with it  did you notice how low his bp was at the end even with three pressors  heart damage  go home theres nothing more you can do tonight  baby boy chenlupino  time of death 657 pm thursday december 2 2004  this is a cross section of the chenlupino boys myocardium  fibrosis lymphocytic infiltrates  there was no sign of lymphocytosis in the blood tests  yes well we all had plenty of good reasons to think bacterial  nobody is scolding you  unfortunately all those clever reasons were wrong  it is a virus infecting their hearts  then were screwed we cant chase down a virus  theres a thousand possibilities we could run gels antibody tests   a thousand of them the kids dont have enough blood  chase youre the intensivist how many could we do before we risk exsanguinating the kids  youre talking vials not stick tests i wouldnt take more than five or six  okay so we have to narrow the thousand viruses down to six  now the autopsys shown us what the virus does  so lets go what do we know  that ribavirin and acyclovir dont knock it out   cross out the herpes viruses  also adenovirus  what else what else keep talking  well iit only seems to hit children   the mothers arent sick so   no toxoplasmosis no rubella  cross out the entire torch syndrome   you didnt find any lung damage  no   none of the paramyxoviridae  cardiac scarring people  cmv  enteroviruses too i think   eleven influenza a  flu a  yes  and  im putting rsv down as a yes  that makes eight   eight vials of blood is pushing it  pushing it well we love that  get the antibody kits start testing the sick kids  all right ill look into whether there are any antivirals for these eight  wait a second the kids on the floor who didnt get sick are any of them still in the hospital  they got moved to the fifth floor but theyre probably all checked out by now  no the limpert boy had a bit of jaundice hes checking out today  i want to test his blood too why  because we need all the information we can get  the healthy kid can be our control group  ill just tell his parents he cant check out because he has the smallpox   stephen morgan contact hospital administration   dr paul to the recovery room    all done all done  what did we get  well the sick babies all tested positive for echovirus 11  great and cmv and parvovirus b19   three viruses  but whats weirder the healthy kid we tested  hes positive for echovirus 11 and cm v antibodies as well  theyre infants  they have their mothers blood their mothers antibodies  so weve just learned nothing uhuh  we have half the picture the healthy kids survived because their mothers antibodies saved them  if the mom had cmv in the past shed have the antibodies for cmv the kid would be immune from it  so we test the sick kids moms for echovirus cmv and parvovirus  and whichever they dont have the antibodies for thats whats killing their kids  ill test the mothers   dr kents office one dr kents office one     echovirus 11  its an enterovirus it lodges in the intestinal tract  enteroviruses cause diarrhea and flulike symptoms in adults maybe a rash  but for newborns it can be deadly  its damaging her heart  well is there anything you can do  viruses are more difficult to treat than bacterial infections  we still havent found a cure for the common cold  so you mean theres no vaccine or  theres a company in pennsylvania developing an antiviral  it got positive results in a lab setting  we managed to get our hands on it  imagine not being able to touch your own baby  can i get your guys help with something sure  your daughter her maxine  thats her name maxine  we need someone to hold maxine up off the bed while the nurse changes her sheet  sure okay   shh shh shh  look at you hi  hold still   thats it  hi easy shh  there you go    hey foreman  got a minute  so pulmonary resistance has stabilized for the two kids but uh bps still  no news then hows cameron  dr cameron sure  lets start with her and then move on to all the other camerons we know  im sorry im just not used to you asking about someones wellbeing  i can understand how the question would surprise you  i dont quite get how it would confuse you   why do you wanna know why do you wanna know why i want to know  just curious me too  you dont get curious  im the most curious man in the world not about trivialities  well then this must not be trivial  how is cameron handling everything  just fine  great glad we talked  your husband is definitely the source of your mono  oh wow  oh thank god  wow im gonna be a mom  whoa   thank you so much i gotta get you a gift or something  sometimes the best gift is the gift of never seeing you again  okay all right  but dr house youve been so awesome  i mean i really totally trust you  do you think you no  could do the prenatal no  or deliver the baby that would be no  okay    wow  chase take a look at this  oh god its good news  no its great     thank you    hi shes doing great  hi little girl  hello  they all gone hartigs are checking out right now  you look tired thanks  its no wonder youve had a hard time the last couple of days  and you havent  not like you  anyone whos that awkward  either has no experience with death or too much  and im pretty sure its not the former  chase told me about that idea you had the parents holding the baby  whered you get that  did you lose someone  did you lose a baby  you can be a real bastard    unfinished business  im in the haystack  ah because now you know youre looking for a needle  right  if i tell you to let it go it wont make any difference will it  enteroviruses are spread by humans  fecal or oral usually  it could be respiratory secretions though  so cuddy got stool samples from the whole staff just wait till they come back  that wont do it why not  the shedder whoever he is hes so virulent he must have been symptomatic  cuddy would have noticed him hmm  and the babies didnt share any common personnel   thats whats weird  yeah yeah thats whats weird   transition team to or 2  transition team to or 2    can i help you  you saved my life i just ran some tests  your will and determination are what saved your life  i know who i am now yes you do  and i know who i am as well  naomi i love you  hey seriously man youre not supposed to be here  im performing a delivery you are  a patient whose prenatal care ive been handling  i just took her on a couple of minutes ago  of course ill need one of you two guys to supervise  whens she due late march  thats five months from now  thank god these chairs are comfortable  thats some bad hat harry
