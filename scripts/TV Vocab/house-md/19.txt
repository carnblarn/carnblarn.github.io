form please proceed to the second floor  wheres the 12yearold girl that was here  needed the gurney she just had a lumbar puncture  shes not supposed to be moved sorry we needed the gurney   hey   hey  you okay hows your head feeling  shes got a headache and shes dizzy  she shouldnt have been moved after the procedure im sorry  im fine what did the test show  no meningitis and no other infections  but youre not carrying a blue form i have something else dont i  somethings causing your symptoms were gonna keep you here overnight  i know its a little crazy in here but hopefully itll settle down  and well be able to get you a room  im sorry im not usually all emotional like this i just  youre doing great your folks land in a few hours  i just i havent slept im so tired  oh my god my eyes bleeding  what is it whats happening  oh dont worry  the antibiotic we gave you in case you had meningitis can turn your tears reddish  thats not blood  but that  thats blood  thats going into my stomach  the lavage showed blood in your gi tract  we need to find where its coming from  you wont feel it  im gonna numb the back of your throat and dr foreman is gonna give you a sedative open   ugh  swallow   now lay on your side for me  and here we go   yell fire or something  people this area is highly contagious  please step back highly contagious   all right try to relax mary this shouldnt take too long     i dont see any tears or lesions   all right im in the stomach  its not bleeding  there was more than a tablespoon of blood in the mouth so its gotta be there  maybe her small intestine  thirty feet of digestive tract it could be anywhere in there  were not gonna see it with this  believe it or not this is a camera  you swallow it and it goes all the way through your system  the antennae pick up the signal from the pill  then we look at the video of your intestines  see where the blood is coming from and fix it  all right water  down the hatch   think ive seen this movie  the endings kind of dark  you want one  how come you did the endoscopy   he asked for help  her blood pressure was high  foreman is not your boss  when i tell you to do something  whoa hold it there  back it up a couple of frames  oh yeah thats your money shot  i dont see anything  really ginormous thing on the right side of her intestine that doesnt intrigue you  does ginormous mean really big or really really small   cause i dont see anything  there the dieulafoy  well we can burn off the swollen blood vessel  but it still doesnt account for her other symptoms  no but it does tell us something  though i have no idea what  could be a precursor to intestinal intussusception  precursor isnt causing all her other symptoms what else  you in the lobby now  i hurt my leg i have a note you had your hour three actually  dr chase i told you to tell us when our time was up  she has intestinal bleeding shell wait  two more buses just arrived we need you downstairs  no you need more nurses but you cut back on the nursing staff  so now youve got doctors doing what nurses should be doing  thats true  i wonder if that has anything to do with you costing us 100 million   attention if you do not have a blue form  you will not be allowed to leave the quarantine area  go be free  if its not the intussusception what about stomach cancer   does she have any abdominal pain  no  then its not stomach cancer have you ruled out sepsis  the lp and blood smears showed no signs of infection here take these two pills and you can go  well the labs working at double their capacity maybe someone screwed up  no fever no neck pain  take the elevator to the third floor whoa whoa whoa wrong form   no fever no neck pain shes fine  smell her hair no chlorine  which means she wasnt at the pool which means shes come to a quarantined area  because shes an idiot or shes insane  no one is that stupid east wing psych ward byebye  neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer  you up to the bs well done  that would account for all her meningeal symptoms rash fever  youre fine take these two pills  get a sample of her bone marrow  from here break time   i need more than 15 minutes  use chases break too  go  you should just fire chase what and miss out on all this fun  so youre gonna torture him for a while and then fire him  thats cold you dont think he has it coming  hey i said fire him thats cold  all he did was save his job what  he completely screwed you over  right rudder  bank bank bank  good coffee the rest of this hospital is busting its tail and youre   what are you doing  trying to think of anything except the produce department at whole foods  i am working it got hot stop acting like a 13yearold sorry  you just dont usually see breasts like that on deans of medicine  oh women cant be heads ofhospitals orjust ugly ones  no they can be babes its just you dont usually see their fun bags  your 300 interview for dr camerons position is in your office  not interviewing today i dont know if youve heard but theres this bigtime epidemic  many sick people puking in the hallways its crazy we can reschedule  no you wont you will interview this person  and ifhe can put two sentences together you will send him to the lobby  where he will do his job  unlike the two of you  come on you know i cant do a bone marrow aspiration in the hallway  and i cant give you a procedure room  i just need something at least close to a sterile environment  i need ten more nurses  brenda listen listen shell die  at least shell have a bed then put that over there   are there dead people in those cabinets   i hope thats whos in there  just be calm relax    ow ow ow ow ow  hang on   hang on  you know i really admire the way you dont care what anyone thinks you just do what you want the way you want  so you went to hopkins for both undergrad and med school   thats right  hes in a band   youre into music  totally  what kind of music do you play  mostly blues you know james cotton some original stuff   oh dude you are so hired  really   not a chance  why  tattoo  wow i thought youd be the last person to have a problem with nonconformity  nonconformity right  i cant remember the last time i saw a 20something kid with a tattoo of an asian letter on his wrist  you are one wicked freethinker  you want to be a rebel stop being cool  wear a pocket protector like he does and get a haircut  like the asian kids who dont leave the library for 20hour stretches  theyre the ones who dont care what you think  sayonara  so should i go through all the resumes looking for asian names  actually the asian kids are probably just responding to parental pressure but my point is still valid   so when do they think youre getting out of here  they dont know  you dont look sick better hope youre not   this equipment looks like its 100 years old  just got it out of storage  it is the previous generation but it works just fine  could you uh could you guys give us a second  if its good news you can tell them  okay were uh were pretty sure its not cancer   hey thats great  ill call your parents  well we still cant release her we still dont know yet exactly whats causing the    mary   whats wrong  shes having an absence seizure mary you okay  she looks fine i need some help over here push two milligrams ativan stat      are you sure it was an absence seizure  absolutely she was totally unresponsive  and unaware of what was going on around her    do you mind were trying to work  we should get back out there cuddys gonna be looking for us  looking but not finding did you do an eeg  seizure frequencys increasing theytheyre almost constant now five in the last half hour  which tells us its definitely in her brain   and its getting worse  and    good lord are you having a bowl movement or a baby    could be barbiturate withdrawal  no it cant be drugs  shes tested at every meet she competes at a bleed in the brain could cause seizures  rat poison could also cause the neck pain  you think shes eating off the floor of her folks garage  doesnt have to be  who would poison a 12yearold  well lets see now theres the 18yearold hasbeen that she beat out to make the nationals  the hasbeens parents jealous siblings sociopathic swim fan  and then theres just your plain old garden variety whack job    hey   you know what a hemorrhoid is  no  well google it and try some raisin bran instead of the doughnuts  do a ct scan check for intracranial bleeding  not a chance radiologys totally swamped  if our patients bleeding into her brain shes gonna be dead in eight hours  she could be but a meningitis patient will be without a ct scan   when i was in med school i had this old professor  who touched you in the naughty place  before the ct scan was introduced he specialized in transcranial ultrasound  hmm  ancient but if theres enough bleeding it might work  okay do what the guy who didnt specialize in neurology said  it was my idea  nyah nyah nyah youve still gotta cover q to z  sorry im late i was taking a dump  im guessing im better off interviewing right after than right before  dr petra gilmar dr gregory house  you actually speak four languages or are you just banking on never being interviewed by anyone who does  its true and i can swear in two more  why are you leaving dr hazel  did you fall for him and cant handle it or was it the other way around   yes well pretty much every fellowship ends that way  no it was nothing like that   you jewish  yes   is it true what they say aboutjewish foreplay     two hours of begging  i heard four  well actually im only halfjewish  look i know you like to play games with people  i know you like to say outrageous things and study how they react  what you should know about me is that i grew up with four brothers  keep your hands to yourself im okay with anything that comes out of your mouth  uh well thats uh great i think thats all we need  thank you for coming by thank you   thats our hitler  no way  are you kidding her backgrounds perfect  shes smart she can obviously deal with your insanity  you see her shoes her shoes  what did your horoscope in vogue tell you to avoid women wearing green shoes  the eyes can mislead a smile can lie  but the shoes always tell the truth   they were prada means she has good taste  they were not prada  you wouldnt know prada if one stepped on your scrotum  okay well they were nice pointy exactly  they were stylish and very painful to wear  only an incredibly shallow insecure woman  would rather be in pain all day long than wear a decentlooking comfortable shoe  and thats exactly the type i dont need around here  no someone who can handle a lot of pain  is exactly the type you do need  excuse me  what are you doing  im ultrasounding your head  youre still having seizures this should help us figure out whats going on  blue form to the security guard youre not gonna be happy with anyone  so what your advice is  hire someone im not happy with and be happy  no my advice is much more subtle stop being an ass  you always find some tiny little flaw to push people away  oh now its people i thought we were talking about fellowship applicants  you have a history of this well when i do decide  to push you away i hope theres a small person kneeling behind you so you fall down and hurt your head  take these theres water over there blue form to the guard  and youre done  you had the perfect person and you blew it  you saw the shoes  im not talking about her youre talking about cameron  im talking about every woman youve ever given a damn about  cameron is so not perfect  well nobodys perfect  mother teresa dead  angelina jolie  no medical degree now whos being picky  youre gonna wind up alone house  you were right theres a significant bleed in her temporal lobe   but no poisons  did tox screens on her blood urine and hair nothing did them twice  hes a little dehydrated put him on a saline drip and give him some orange juice  i need an operating room and a neurosurgeon  given the current crisis im tempted to say no  but since youve been so sweet to me today  our little mermaid is bleeding into her temporal lobe   how fast can you have her prepped  twenty minutes  youll have a surgeon in the room in ten    mr and mrs carroll are you dr house   this is dr foreman  is mary all right  the operation went well  the intracranial pressures been relieved and the swellings already going down  oh thank god well what happened  i mean did she bang her head at a meet or did she   no nothing like that  then why is she bleeding is she gonna be all right  im sorry we still dont know   no toxins no tumor no bone cancer   renal failure could cause the rash fever and muscle pain  maybe its some sort of genetic kidney disorder  no family history   and no blood in her urine or uremia  not yet  you want to do a differential based on symptoms that might happen   you got a better idea  stop it  stop looking for things we dont know and focus on what we do know  what do we actually know besides whats up there  come on how hard can it be to tell me what you already know   shes 12  she spends a lot of time in pools exposure to chemicals    she travels a lot  but never out of the country   what else  come on  were gonna put you right here  were missing something  what well if i knew that it wouldnt be missing   maybe shes adopted and weve got the wrong history  no shes got her moms eyes and a red patch of hair just like dad   what about an allergic reaction  that could explain the rash and muscle pain but probably not the bleeding or seizures  thats a lot of balloons   you think shes allergic to polyester  not unless shes been competing in the nude all these years  then what are you thinking what do the balloons mean  what if the rash isnt a rash  what are you talking about  who gave her the balloons some of the girls from her team  theyve been visiting her pretty regularly but none of them are sick what about the guys   none of them are sick either  which guys visited her  uh   actually none  shes cute shes nice  shes a kickass diver  youd think the guys would be falling all over themselves to get close to her  shes 12 the youngest guy on her team is 16   okay so maybe theyre just not interested or  theyre avoiding her  there any cell fragments in her blood smears  no red blood cells were intact  check em again  blood looks like its been put through the blender now   you done yet you were right  the rash wasnt a rash shes bleeding into her skin its purpura  thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  starts with t you were so close   what could have set it off  she had no traces of e coli in her cultures  shes obviously not menopausal so no estrogen  there is one other possible cause  oh god  pregnancy causes  all kinds of chemical and biological changes  in a womans body  or a girls body as the case may be  in extremely rare cases everything goes haywire its called ttp  blood starts clotting like crazy and clogs the vessels in your brain and kidneys  red blood cells end up getting shredded as they squeeze past the clot  like a fat guy in a crowded bar  im sure you know what thats like  i mean youre only 12 but youre all grown up right  travel on your own hang out in hotel rooms  getting room service with your teammates  maybe someone sneaks in a couple of beers you start playing spin the bottle  next thing you know youre waking up with nothing on but your socks  it wasnt like that of course not   you wanted it  yeah i did  he turned out to be a jerk but  actually under new jersey law the term is felon  i knew what i was doing  were gonna have to do something called plasmapheresis  cleans the antibodies from your blood  were also gonna have to terminate the pregnancy  you gonna tell my parents  someone should rock paper scissors  they dont need to know  ill be all right  of course you will  i mean if youre old enough to bleed out of your vagina  then obviously youre mature enough  to handle a simple thing like an abortion without mommy and daddys help  you gonna tell my parents  under new jersey law youre the boss    your daughter has ttp  dont worry its curable shell be fine  well wait i mean what does ttp stand for  some really big words that youve never heard before  and when were done will never hear again  have a nice day   well when can we take her home  uh in a few days  she needs some minor surgery to remove the underlying cause  before we can do the another really big word  whats the underlying cause   she has an abnormal growth in her abdomen  what kind of surgery  its its very simple  we do it here all the time   could you be a little more specific  actually no  im sorry    were almost done  hang in there  youre doing good  feeling okay  yeah you should be   your platelets counts up  hows your neck  looks good anything else we can get you  no thanks  okay  yeah  can i see my mom and dad    plasmapheresis is working shes gonna be fine  i know  hi ive got these    i cant even tell you how much i appreciate  the opportunity to meet with you   the moment i heard you had another fellowship
