february2006  desire by ryan adams   two hearts fading like a flower    and all this waiting for the power    for some answer to this fire    sinking slowly    the waters higher   mmm desire    desire    with no secrets    no obsession    this time im speeding with no direction    without a reason    what is this fire    burning slowly    my one and only   mmm desire    desire   wilson howd you get here  by osmosis  no helmet  didnt seem like riding weather  and the fact that you can barely stand upright had nothing to do with it   infarctions hurt thats what they do   house  worsening pain could actually be a good thing  means the nerves might be regenerating  could be good could be bad  thanks for the differential any other options  have you ever considered a career as a motivational speaker   why dont you check out some rehab  i did the rehab thing  one session and you didnt even finish that session  the guy wanted me to visualize the healing  i can do that home  at least let me get you an mri  its a very simple equation more pain more pills  teenage supermodel  presented with double vision sudden aggressive behavior cataplexy  you had me at teenage supermodel   you okay  mmhmm  wow you should be a model  are you really 15  who are you  ill be the one saving her life today  assuming shes dying who are you  hes my father  any idea whats wrong with her  well from the looks of it not a single thing  probably should stop staring and check out the file  so what set off the brawl  she stand in your light  i didnt even know her  i didnt know what happened  look i know some models are notorious for hissy fits  but alex ive never even seen her get angry  even when she was a kid she was  im sure she was delightful in her youth  and then you passed out  i was passed out but i wasnt  i knew what was going on but i couldnt move or talk  yeah that sounds like a medical thing  its called cataplexy  cat fight and cataplexy on the catwalk cool  how much were you drinking  she only had one sip of champagne  forget it well find out from the tox screen  all right look i gave her a valium  do you think thats what did this  no  how long have you had the sweats   a couple of days  any other complaints  uh my stomachs been bothering me  and ive been feeling a little nauseous  okay heres how this works  my lackeys will be by shortly to draw some blood collect some urine any other fluids you got  theyll do some other doctorly stuff  and well be in touch  since when do you voluntarily go see patients    have you seen her  shes 15  yeah but theres something about her  something in her eyes a kind of maturity  yeah yeah shes an old soul this is creepy even for you  shes a fashion model on the cover of magazines  they hold her up as the sexual ideal  but the law says we cant touch her for three more years how hypocritical is that  did the history reveal anything oh i dont know medically relevant  history right  i knew i was forgetting something  you should do one of those while youre running the labs and the tox screen  labs show valium and heroin in her urine  a supermodel on smack shocker  oh  alex i expected so much more from you  heroin chic is so five years ago  okay lets start crossing out withdrawal symptoms  a positive test means she tried it once  doesnt mean shes an addict shes only 15  theres no age limit on addiction  hes right  shes never menstruated sounds like a symptom of drug addiction to me  or bulimia or her age  some girls dont start till their mid to late teens  evidence to the contrary the rounded hips  the perfectly sculpted bountiful breasts  chase implants  ive seen some of her photos  theyve grown dramatically since last summer  symptomatic of turning 14  two clinic hours says that those love apples are handcrafted by god  whoa i thought you didnt believe in god  i do now  youre on  could we talk about her health instead of her breasts  it could be relevant  come on cameron theres nothing to be ashamed of  many women develop breasts  no im fine  even if she is an addict a lot of her symptoms the cataplexy the violence  they could be neurological  we chalk this up to drugs we could be releasing her with juvenile ms or parkinsons or  so detox her  fine well set her up on a program theyll wean her onto the methadone  and in four weeks well know youre right  or well know that camerons right and the pretty girl will do milan next fall in a wheelchair  put her in a coma and pump her full of naltrexone cut the four weeks to one night  the lab reports show that your daughter had heroin in her system  were you aware of her drug use  no  we think shes suffering from withdrawal symptoms  detoxing generally takes several weeks  the danger is that if the drugs are masking some of other illness  it could worsen before weve weaned her off of the heroin  well how much worse  we dont know because we dont know whats wrong  there is a rapid detox procedure  we flush her system with an opioid antagonist  itll end her addiction overnight  but the process is dangerous because we have to induce a coma  it also means that if she ever relapses theres a good chance shell overdose because her body wont react to the drug  so either way im  im risking her life  do you have to tell her how dangerous it is  is it dangerous  there are certain risks  weve gone over them with your father  and hes not worried  hes your dad  hes always gonna worry  but he knows were gonna take good care of you  oh everythings starting to hurt my legs  heroin withdrawal is an extremely painful process  but were gonna put you to sleep you wont feel a thing  promise  i promise  it was a pretty stupid thing to do huh  getting hooked on drugs  yeah not the best move youve ever made  alex i justi thought it would be fun  chase you dont have to explain to us  a lot of the other girls were  when you wake up youll feel a lot better    nurse nurse  you son of a bitch you killed her   shes not dead  she had a heart attack  shes stable now the anesthesia  get her out of that coma  dont think so  stop this all right ii dont consent anymore  i want to do the slow detox  did you ever get a paper cut  a really nasty one between the fingers  multiply that by about a billion  and itll just barely approach the kind of suffering shell experience if we wake her right now  were committed to this  shes out till morning go get a book  i havent slept in weeks  because my teeth hurt  dentist couldnt find any cavities  and im getting these headaches  oh poor you  i think im going crazy  and my stomach i roll out of bed and i want to puke  i take it your married  you must be psychic  you must be witty  whens she due   howd you know she was  because im doing her  youve got couvade syndrome  which is just a fancy way of saying you should stop whining  millions of women have got the same thing theyre not bugging me  youre suffering from sympathetic pregnancy  gotta go people dying the whole circle of life thing   its all in my head  nope its all in your hormones  good news is no ones gonna lecture you if you smoke and get drunk  shouldnt she be awake by now  its only been a half an hour since we stopped the medicine  well you said thats how long it would take  i said it would take about half an hour  well couldnt this mean something  so far it means nothing  she had a heart attack she could have brain damage she could have something  shes opening her eyes  alex you okay  can you hear me  hmm  i got the cute doctor  huh do you feel any pain  good let us know if anything changes  if your stomach doesnt feel right anything  hey  are you mad at me daddy  i let you down  no no not at all sweetie i  i shouldve been more mature i shouldve handled the pressure  stop stop  were gonna get you better all right  nothing else matters  excuse me  weve got you on what we call a banana bag  plenty of vitamins nutrients  i got the cute doctor  are you mad at me daddy  i let you down  whats going on  i shouldve been  more mature i shouldve handled the pressure  whats wrong with her  anterograde amnesia shortterm memory loss  evidence of a hypoxic brain injury  might be a result of getting cut off from the oxygen when she flatlined  probably the result of that rapid detox you told us to push on her  you gonna put that down  you gonna sulk  im not gonna indulge you  treatment of hypoxic brain injuries consist of   cameron chase and the dark one  foreman right  patient flatlined for like 30 seconds  gotta be oxygen deprived for longer than that to lose brain function   we cant be sure how long she was  her brains fine  memory loss  youre saying thats not a neurological symptom  no im saying what im saying her brains fine  shes faking  shes got post traumatic stress disorder  we got models fighting in iraq now  show me a woman on heroin who looks like that  and ill show you a woman whos been sexually abused  thats your proof that shes goodlooking  he manages her career  travels  the world with her at her side 247  hes either a very good dad or a very bad dad  house you saw that touckhus  would the fact that shes your daughter really stop you  oh  her brain is running away from reality  when the drugs cant do it anymore it starts to shut down  your theory has the advantages of being completely unprovable and completely exculpating you  when you guys are done talking do an mri and an lp  when her brain checks out as normal then well know that daddy really really loves her  wheres house  said he was in too much pain to work  whos covering  he called 15 minutes after his shift started its too late to find anybody   exam room one  ugh   hi  wheres dr house  wish i knew huh  whats the problem  its personal  and its so personal he didnt bother writing anything in your chart  its getting worse  what is  its personal    fine you can wait  doctor  i tell you what  i am gonna give you dr houses personal pager number  why would your mind go to abuse so fast  cause i had a funny uncle  you were abused  what no why would your mind go to that so fast  i just had a funny uncle great stories always filthy  i dont know if its something with this case  or you got something personal going on the whole breakup thing   its personal  house  your pain is affecting your decisionmaking  you got a problem with a call i make question the call  dont make it personal  are you saying pain cant affect your mood  if im right about the pain  youre gonna want to rush everything which is what youre doing  dont  thank you  are you doing your daughter  what  we should probably talk privately huh  come on walk with me   im not  hes not  im sure hes not  she is a babe though  were gonna need you to keep still  i am  what do you think that means  its  either neurological or psychological  the only thing we know for sure is its gonna screw up the mri results  which is gonna make house think hes right  this is a waste of time lets just get the lp  i should take your head off  your glands are fine see now youre my patient  you got doctorpatient confidentiality no worries  so what did you do to her   why would you possibly think  hard to imagine anyone not wanting to nail her   you son of a  its a compliment  a heartshaped ass those perfect perky allnatural breasts  that is my daughter youre talking about  no thats your daughter you were talking about  she just instinctively knows how to walk  designers just love that heartshaped ass those perfect perky  im her manager i have to promote her  oh that makes sense so you compartmentalize  when youre dealing with the press youre her manager  when youre helping with homework youre her dad  when youre making sweet sweet love   youre her manager  all right  do you love her   i have never touched her  do you love her  what are you doing you trying to trap me into saying  do you love her enough to admit that you slept with her  psychology conditions can manifest themselves in physical problems  sometimes these can be extreme enough to kill  there are treatments but only if theres a diagnosis  are you gonna admit that you slept with your daughter or are you just gonna let her die  one time  ptsd  get her a psych referral and pack her bags he did her  dont think so  daddy thinks so  could be mistaken he said he was drunk  maybe it was some other daughter  elevated proteins in her csf  youre wrong about ptsd and i was wrong about the hypoxic brain injury  daddy didnt do this to her and neither did we  we have to call child protective services  doctorpatient confidentiality  doesnt apply in abuse cases you know that  cameron were mandated to report sexual abuse  is it okay if i save her life first  or do you want to make sure that daddy doesnt get visitation rights to the gravesite  okay elevated proteins in her csf could mean dozens of different things  viral encephalitis cnsv  creutzfeldtjakob disease  so were just gonna leave a child molester in the same room as his victim  its got windows  fine arrest him use cuddys handcuffs  if youre too distracted to deal with this because your leg hurts then  yeah im distracted  im all hung up on this 15yearold patient whos cataplectic  cant remember what she had for lunch and is rapidly losing control of her body  and i want her father here in case they got any more secrets that i need to know about  now if youre not too distracted go take out a piece of her brain stick it under  a microscope  wilson  whoa whoa whoa you really think we need to jump straight to brain biopsy  nope lets continue playing pin the diagnosis on the supermodel until shes dead  heard you killed your supermodel  only for a minute  just for my own clarity how many more patients do you have to kill  before you admit this leg thing just might be a problem  three  i need your help  were gonna do something called a burr hole biopsy  we drill a small opening in the back of your skull  doctor maybe you and i should talk about this first  no  i just think alex doesnt need to be overwhelmed right now  i think she should have a say in what happens to her body  were gonna remove a small piece of brain tissue  dodo you have to shave my hair  hair grows back  i guess i wont remember anyways  theres a good chance the amnesias only temporary  okay  find a way to kick up the contribution  what did house do now  house this is god  look im a little busy right now  not supposed to talk during these things  you got time thursday  let me check oh ive got a plague how about friday  youll have to check with cameron  oh damn it  she always wants to know why bad things happen  like im gonna come up with a new answer this time  house  quick god smite the evil witch  are you sitting on evidence that your patient was sexually abused by her father  god why have you forsaken me  cuddy dont worry ive contacted child services for you  i left you get away with more than anyone in this hospital  shielding a child abuser isnt covered  cooperate with this investigation or ill fire you  chase what do you think house is gonna do to you  no idea  well you did the right thing  if you hadnt gone to cuddy i wouldve  if this guy had known we had to report him hed never have told house the truth  shes a child she needs to be protected  she dropped out of high school to make millions of dollars  why does she need more protection than some crack whore shivering in the clinic waiting room  i think youre just afraid to piss house off  theres that too  mri looks exactly the same as it did two years ago  nerves dont seem to be regenerating  i figured as much  several different researchers have proven psychological pain can manifest as physical pain  you think i have a conversion disorder you want me to see a shrink  brilliant idea sending stacy away  its really done wonders for you  listen none of this has anything to do with stacy  right giant coincidence that youve gone completely off the rails since she left  inducing migraines worsening leg pain  ow  aw you miss stacy too  brain biopsy shows no white matter disease  cameron you gonna go tell cuddy  or has she already got you wired for sound  i had to do what i thought was right  so white is out that just leaves gray  foreman neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis heller syndrome  any one of the mitochondrial encephalopathies  am i in trouble  you had to do what you thought was right  they call it gray area cause you never really know whats there  we cant test for any of those things  so im not in trouble  you can torture yourself all you want  what if everything were seeing is just smoke signals  okay whos sending them  tumor  if has cancer anywhere in her body she could also have paraneoplastic syndrome  which would be causing antibodies to attack her brain  antibodies are stupid that way  paraneoplastic syndromes awfully rare in a 15yearold  like that are awfully rare  it would explain the aggressive behavior the cataplexy the memory loss even the twitching  its perfect  what if its not  we could waste weeks searching for a tumor that we dont even know is there  then lets make sure it is there  theres no test for paraneoplastic syndrome  sure there is the squeeze the tube test  what did the biopsy tell you  it wasnt definitive  but the twitching should stop right about  now  oh my god  house couldve just been a coincidence  twitching does tend to stop and start lets be sure  ivig vacuums her blood neutralizes the stuff thats making her twitch  its actually kind of cool  wonder if i could make you dance  enough  this is unbelievable you did it you fixed her  no all i did was prove that she has cancer  i need a favor  im not in a giving mood  itll help us both  i need a shot of morphine in my spine  if your leg hurts take your vicodin  its not enough  get a syringe  morphine is extreme even for you  yeah read that on the insert  get one of your lackeys to do it  i dont want them knowing  that youre on the road to becoming a junkie  that im in this much pain  i dont want them questioning my judgment  i cant ask wilson because he figures its all in my head  well i agree with him  im going home  well what about this  what are you doing  is this in my head  cause i could swear i remember a thigh muscle being here  ill get a syringe   its gotta be cancer  its not cancer  you seem to be back to your old miserable self  so i just randomly predicted shed respond to ivig  her twitches are gone her memorys getting better  what did you take  if the increased pain was psychological no drugs gonna help  if you think itll help the drugs will help   power of the mind  youre right  the more i talk to you the more the pain floods back  knew the twins were real chase owes me   you check the pancreas  oh come on  youre just making up organs now arent you  we checked the pancreas   obviously youve taken something  you check the bones  there are a lot of bones i think  and none of them have cancer  ovaries  theres no mass if anything theyre undersized  no leukemia no hodgkins we checked everything  unless theyve invented a new organ its not cancer  differential diagnosis  its gotta be cancer theres gotta be something we missed  you gotta learn to let go foreman  maybe the protein level was some sort of anomaly it might still  just be ptsd  just ptsd yeah daddys diddling her nothing to worry about  chase okay let me rephrase  maybe the protein level was some sort of anomaly  oh my god it might be ptsd  if it was ptsd the twitching wouldnt have magically disappeared when we started the ivig  mmm wrong  what it wouldnt have done was medically disappear  nothing to stop it from magically disappearing  she was watching me stop and start the medicine  you think shes faking  not consciously  but if her subconscious is trying to get away from it all cancers gotta be a lovely vacation spot  tell her youve gotta give her a fresh iv  dont tell her youre starting her on saline  well see if the twitching comes back  how long has the social worker been in there  just went in  she was in with the dad before  you switch the girls iv  about half an hour ago  when is she gonna start twitching  if shes gonna start twitching another few minutes  weve gotta wait for the remaining ivig to clear her system  that was quick whats gonna happen  what did you think was gonna happen   the father had sex  do you have any medical evidence of that   he admitted  he denies that conversation ever took place   she  she denies it too  im sure you meant well    you have to tell her the truth  nothing happened  you dont have to be afraid of him they can protect you  from what things are fine  you think things are fine theyre not  hes my dad  hes abusing you  hes not a bad person  i seduced him  youre the child hes the adult   he has the responsibility  i got him drunk  i had to get him drunk  i wanted to have sex with him  youre sexually attracted to your father  no  but by sleeping with him now he lets me do whatever i want  i also slept with my photographer my financial manager and my tutor  if i hadnt id be getting cs and posing for newspaper ads back in detroit  hmm come on we all do it  no we dont  after you father slept with you you were traumatized  my dad was last  youve never taken a run at your boss or a professor or somebody else you needed  youre 15  youre smart you dont have to  i am not that smart  i am that beautiful  whats wrong with me  aw george get your butt over here  george help me  how did you get my pager number  please  problem is if i give you an epidural  you wont be able to feel when to push   youre not funny  pretty sure i am  you just cant appreciate it because youre in pain  george if you dont get off your ass and help me  oh shut up  got yourself the perfect man a woman  hes got more estrogen coursing through his veins than  oh aw ohhhhhh   who did her vaginal exam  i did  did she have hair  what are you getting at  right now im getting at whether or not she had hair down there  uh not much  she manipulative yet completely docile  everybody tells us that outburst on the catwalk was out of character  shes never had a period  youre thinking this is hormonal  im thinking shes the ultimate woman  ii need to schedule an mri  the twitching stopped  because we changed your medicine back to the real stuff stop talking  you gave me fake medicine  thats what i said  in the vain hope that you wouldnt feel the need to also say it  stop talking  wilson already did an ultrasound said her ovaries were undersized  the ultrasound would be the way to go if you were looking for ovarian cancer  what are we looking for  that  oh my god  looks like a tumor doesnt it  but those are  yep  we found a tumor  she has cancer  technically no  so its not cancer  no its cancer but he has cancer  on his left testicle  i dont have testicles  shes not a guy  his dna says youre wrong  frogs and snails and puppy dog tails  youve got male pseudohermaphroditism  see we all start out as girls  and then were differentiated based on our genes  the ovaries develop into testes and drop  but in about 1 and 150000 pregnancies a fetus with an xy chromosome a boy develops into something else  like you  your testes never descended  because youre immune to testosterone  youre pure estrogen  which is why you get heightened female characteristics  clear skin great breasts  the ultimate woman is a man  natures cruel huh  this is obviously a joke this isis impossible  no a joke would be me calling you a homo  see the difference  ill schedule him for surgery  no youre wrong im a girl  look at me how can you say im not a girl  see theyre all looking at me im  im beautiful  that anger thats just the cancer talking  put your clothes back on im gonna cut your balls off  then youll be fine  hows the patient  postop  i set himher up for a psych visit  calling her himher isnt really helping  good news is i dont think dads gonna be sleeping with himher again  see now its gross  i need another shot  when did the pain start coming back  a few hours ago  about an hour after you solved the case  if i wanted to be psychoanalyzed id get wilson to give me the shot  same dosage  if youd be comfortable i might be able to deal with a few less ccs of morphine  it wasnt morphine  what did you give me   i told you i wanted  it was saline  i gave you a placebo    desire by ryan adams   you know me    you dont mind waiting    you just cant show me    but god im praying    that youll find me    and that youll see me    thatll you run and never tire    mmm desire    desire
