well if hes an old man osteopenia would just be a fact of life  you make him comfortable send him home which means youre just boring me  so hes young which means its most likely caused by cancer  youre here because you havent found it have you looked really really hard  mri and pet scan are both negative  well how old is he maybe the osteopenia is just early onset  ah lets see  born 92177  its hank wiggen  and he signed it sweet yeah  tojimmy wilson the cy young of medicine  did you ask for that just the jimmy part  the bones too thin to support the kind of surgery that would let him pitch again  but if we figure out whats causing the osteopenia  we can reverse the bone damage then do the surgery  beat the yankees and save the free world  it was a working dinner  my work company pays  i dont know i just feel kind of weird after what it turned into  well then it stopped being work  you know if itll solve your ethics problem  you can reimburse me for these  what are they 557 i believe  mmm let me know about friday   yeah  mmm         none of the usual suspects  age isnt right in apparent perfect health before this incident  mri and pet scan negative for tumors test him again its gotta be cancer  sorry im late car broke down on the interstate  dont believe you chem7 shows a poor kidney function   why would a guy in his 20s have a poor kidney function  cancer  it first attacks the bones and then the kidneys  come on people he was 17 and 7 his era was 21  you want it to be his kidneys because if its his kidneys then maybe we can treat it fix it  and if its cancer then hell never pitch again  if this were a regular guy who broke his arm lifting a box you wouldve sent him home  my god youre right i lost my head all life is equally sacred  i promise you the next knitting injury that comes in here were on it like stink on cheese   he weighed 175 his rookie year  stop  now hes 195 after playing a year in japan  why he let himself go  steroids the guy was a drug user im sure he wouldnt have balked at pumping up through chemicals  thatd explain the weight gain and the kidney problems  and the bone loss go ask him what hes on  when he says nothing have him pee in a cup  if your car breaks down youre an hour late not two minutes  and two minutes isnt late enough to use a clever excuse like car trouble  i was coming in early huh  unprompted lies thats a bad sign  either a guilty conscience or something personals going on  see thats all you had to do just walk in sit down do your job  no no i never took em  were gonna need a urine sample  oh no you dont trust me  baby im worried about takin this morphine  youre in pain  the doses are monitored its not a slip  besides opiates werent your thing  they shouldve been whoa  mr wiggen the urine sample  i wanna say no so i am no  trust is a big issue in early recovery he really did gain the weight honestly  if you say so  youre not gettin it  he thinks im an idiot  he sure does  should we save a sample  dr sports fan can put it in lucite and hang it around his neck  hey friday night can you cover for me  i think so  oh friday no im sorry i have to go to that oncology thing the seminar  oh whats goin on  dinner with the drug rep  castine pharmaceuticals  arnie claims he has 500 lawyer jokes only tells one  uh new guy  you need cash   no l i dont have that much on me  no no its not a problem  ill be over by 600 okay   its 445 i was rounding up  carol moffatt please see dr house in exam one   whoa whoa not so fast cathy  its carol  uh uh trouble with the leg   whens the wedding  this saturday  ooh not much time to fit into that pretty dress and no time for practical shoe shopping   youre running two miles a day further than you should be  it hurts right here  new shoes less miles and ixnay on the afternoon cokes youre gonna look beautiful   whats wrong with you  i cant get my contact lenses out  out of what theyre not in your eyes   but theyre red  thats because youre trying to remove your corneas  whats wrong with you uh lately my wife has noticed that  yeah yeah symptoms were working on a personal best here  uuh numbness in my feet and hands uh constipation  and maybe he doesnt feel comfortable talking about his private matters  well neither would i if i was having trouble controlling my peepee  youre a dentist nitrous oxide poisoning  which means youre either dipping into your own supply or you got a bad valve in the office  laughing gas rehabs probably more expensive than the plumber  meanwhile get yourself some b12  whos left i cant see  no im just screwin with you its a hangover  my english lit prof told me hed fail me next time if i didnt show up with a doctors note  well make friends with the dentist he can give you a note and maybe a little nitrous to take the edge off   dr house  he tested negative for steroids  elevated beta2 proteins though  could be cancerous amyloidosis or lymphoma  or steroids you guys got any money on you  he tested negative for steroids  i have a couple 20s on me fifty ofem  foreman the fatpad biopsy and abdominal ct scan were negative for the cancers but  that just leaves us with steroids  he tested negative for steroids  less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer  than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use  but there is one thing they cant hide  hi im dr house  and this is the coolest day of my life    see steroid use shrinks the testicles  im clean man no steroids no nothin  your lips say no your prunes say yes  hypogonadism isnt that a great word  thanks we dont get to say it nearly enough start him on lupron right away  these freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment  for money i feel sorry for them  he drops a clean urine denies using steroids  and youre giving him a drug for what steroid abuse  no no its not its got calcium in it  its very good for the bones  basically at a molecular level its just milk     dr whitman to anesthesiology dr whitman anesthesiology  how long do you figure before i get a call from cuddy    you put him on lupron  uhhuh   and you told them it was like milk  yes  is there any way in which that is not a lie  its creamy   but i had three reasons  good ones  well well see in a minute im just making them up now   he lied to me first  your mother did teach you two wrongs dont make a right  lfhe lies to me about not taking steroids and i lie to him about not treating steroids hes cured  adds up for me second reason  if i told him the truth he wouldnt have taken the stuff  and if he told you the truth what would the stuff do to him   severe respiratory problems  third reason  i wanted to eliminate the placebo effect  excellent  you and your lawyer can write a paper  which brings me to my fourth reason i thought you said there were only three   i thought youd buy one ofem  seriously  hes not gonna sue  because his lawyer is a nice guy  wholl realize its unfair to blame us for ruining this kids 100 million career  good guess but no  if the lupron causes respiratory problems it means hes not on steroids  which means theres something else wrong with him  and the choices for that something else  are almost universally very bad       osteopenia messing his bones up  hypogonadism impaired liver function kidney function  and we have managed to find the only professional athlete in the galaxy  who is not on steroids  and its not cancer  so whats killing him  who shares my suspicions that the yankees were somehow involved  shrunken testicles indicate his bodys not putting out enough testosterone  throw out the lungs that was the lupronmy fault dont worry ill send him a nice note  what about something environmental  arsenic mercury the symptoms could indicate  pretty small environment wifes fine no one else is sick  if you throw out the kidneys everything else adds up  the testicles the bones the impaired liver function  could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands  addisons disease i like it  mainly of course because the treatment is   steroids  enough irony for all of us  treatment would cause him to retain fluid   with the kidneys almost shut down already hell die  so well get him a new kidney  your theory is that addisons is causing all the symptoms  except for the kidney problems   whats causing the kidney problems  cameron if you had to make an ironic guess right about now   he tested negative for steroids  agreed hes not on steroids now  but if he was on them at any time in the last five years it could have caused the kidney damage  you see kidneys dont wear watches  sure gall bladders do but it doesnt matter cause kidneys cant tell time  steroid damage could take years  no steroids how many times does he have to tell you  i dont know  how many times did he lie about cocaine before coming clean with the league   thats completely different  oh thats right i remember  you never did come clean the league was out to get you they faked the blood tests  you had to get yourself a lawyer and everything  if hank says he never used steroids thats the truth  thats too bad because our theory is that the kidney damage is caused by a   and everything else is caused by b  the beauty of this theory is that we can treat a and b  but if you add the kidney symptoms back into the mix  then we are looking at another letter altogether  one that is apparently not in the alphabet  we cant fix the bones no more baseball no more breathing  no more brain function  get another explanation  okay yeah i think i got one in my other pants  hold on  five years ago bangor maine  my pitching coach had me on something i never knew what it was  and you never tried too hard to find out either  i gained twelve pounds of muscle in like four weeks  im sorry baby  huh  how ya doin doc good very good yeah  you want me to put hank wiggen on the transplant list  he needs a new kidney i was thinking the kidney people might have some  they like to save them for people who have how do i put this kidney problems  hes a professional ball player brings joy to millions  do you really want to be known as the hospital that sent him home to die  thats a great idea we could be the hospital that killed two people  the guy who deserved the kidney and the ball player we bumped up the list  when we werent even sure what was wrong with him  everything else is related to the addisons  the test for addisons was inconclusive  the test for addisons is always inconclusive  why do we do it at all we should just ask you  youre not putting him on the list  your powers of deduction are breathtaking   you take a perverse pleasure in turning me down  what i live for  once in a while though try to ruin my day ask me something i can say yes to  oh im sorry doctor i didnt know you were busy want me to come back   is he on the list  no   then im giving him one of mine  okay  youre not gonna tell me its a bad idea why give a kidney to someone who might not be able to use it  not my area  that is however my chair  when do we do it  very noble gesture  my favorite kind dramatic yet completely empty  the chances of nonidentical twins being a match  you live alone you writing a book  i made it a question just cause its more polite  you got a big keep out sign stapled on your forehead  that explains it i told em to put it on my door  even if real human contact is something you dont have or even want or need  you should at least be able to see it in other people  yeah right  true love thats just how we match organs these days  theres a couple in france high school sweethearts theyre trading brains  were a match run your tests    hey the lab call is she a match  havent heard yet  you got a text message though friday night very cryptic  gee thanks for checking can you cover for me  oncology seminar right  friday night the same thing as the car trouble  i had car trouble  house says you were lying i believe him  whats that you got a little wet smudge at the end of your nose  hey i like the guy he says what he wants does what he wants  he wont talk to anyone unless he can jerk them around  or needs a thousand bucks what is with that  i scored  its a brave new world doc  and we are the cutting edge  you are looking at two allaccess passes  to paradise itself  how much true cost no man can say  could that mans accountant say  one thousand dollars whew  friday night the biggest official monster truck jam in the history of new jersey  okay please tell me you didnt just say friday night  whatever youve got you cancel   i cant do it they only give these tickets to owners  anytime we wanna be in the middle of the track were in the middle of the track  these tickets are so good we have to sign a release  i mean it we do this we could die  ive got the oncology thing l l  the rectal cancer lecture they booked me a year ago lllli cant get out  theres no way out  fine ill ask one of my other friends  huh  what youre saying ive only got one friend  uh and whwho  kevin in bookkeeping  okay well first of all his names carl  i call him kevin  its his secret friendship club name  its hookers  oh my god  multiple hookers but house is house hes gotta have it his way four or five women  this isnt even funny what you dont think he has sex   no of course he  he doesnt have sex he makes love   i didnt say that    its the lab  dr foreman   respiratory therapy call 4702  respiratory therapy pick up 4702  if you have the results id like you to talk to both of us if you dont im late for a meeting  believe me id much rather be with your better half  and by better half i mean the one who struck out sammy sosa on three pitches  and talks a lot less  but i thought i would talk to you first and alone  i got your results back from the lab  you do match  l i do  youre also pregnant  you cant be a donor  not in your current condition  um excuse me  i have to go talk to my husband    heart looks good we can schedule the transplant  no transplant  lolas not gonna have an abortion  actually your wife just told me that she was making an appointment  i dont care what she said  i think you two need to discuss this further  weve been trying to get pregnant almost since we met  well its your wifes decision whether or not  she wants to trade a child for a kidney thats murder  im not gonna let her do that  foreman says weve got a problem about the transplant  if she terminates the pregnancy hes not gonna let himself die on principle  would you give up a baby for someone you love  please tell me i dont have to decide  it depends how long would they live  this is a pragmatic question for you  fifty years no problem  six months i say let him die  ive actually given this a lot of thought my personal tipping point is seven years eight months and 14 days  i couldnt do it  you found religion   do you have to be religious to believe a fetus is a life  there seems to be a correlation  im uh   do you like monster trucks   i dont know what they are  right  i got two tickets friday night   you asking me to go with you  sure sounds good  like a date  exactly  except for the the date part  forget it  uh no l i was gonna go to the oncology dinner  of course you have to hear wilsons lecture  no i just found out he canceled like two weeks ago  so what do i wear  still with us hank yeah im here  my chest feels funny  tachycardia your hearts beating too fast  were sorting it out but you stay with us all right   keep talking to us hank  wheres lola  ten units of insulin subq an iv push d50   whys his potassium up  damned if i know  kayexalate too we gotta suck that potassium out of him we gotta get his heart rate down    we need a crash cart  you got it     its definitely not addisons  its not steroids either  set help in here please  his heart rate is 130 and rising like a randyjohnson line drives  a for effort theres no point in doing the transplant  even if he was stable enough its obvious that we have no idea whats wrong with him  first its too high now its too low  his hearts not responding to the atropine  heart rates down to 40 i thought it was up  now its down last time he went out at 35   whats wrong  i have no idea  hit him with the atropine before he gets to 35 again   weve already given him three milliliters   apparently thats not enough   we cant stabilize his heart rate   what did you do to him kayexalate  his pulse was through the roof so was his potassium   it wouldnt do this  something did  call me when hes stable or dead  i remember the first time  you werent even supposed to be pitching that day  id flown all the way to tokyo to watch this kid  and he gets tossed for arguing a call in the first inning  ah your pitches perfect  ball seemed to go faster than your arm  it was like the rules didnt apply like physics couldnt slow you down  hot damn it was beautiful  hey warner  hey kid how ya feelin  i hurt  my arm my head everywhere  they mustve dialed down the morphine  thats just wrong man youre in pain  hey i got somethin for ya  no  a doc in st louis gave em to me for migraine  im an addict i cant take that even lola was okay with the morphine  this stuffs just a little stronger  come on  ill just try one warner   dr mulvaney please call extension 6134  dr mulvaney please call extension 6134  three more symptoms  heart rate up heart rate down  now hes hallucinating you gotta promise not to tell lola  okay coach hes not just dreaming  no rem hes actually awake  drugs not psychedelics  not with the heart symptoms  well hallucinations would point to digitalis it would also mess up his heart  but hes not on it  and why would he take it  yeah  pithy analysis  i can see why they asked you to speak at the cancer dinner  im sorry im gonna miss it  im sorry about the monster trucks  no i think its great youre giving back  only thing is  uh digitalis  it would only explain the later symptoms  not the original ones  sure you know its got a lot of movement  problem is everybody sees the movement  youre throwin your curveball like youreyoure throwin a curveball  deception thats the   same motion  less movement but it wont come back at you   all right outfielders move in right there  howd you get in here  spoke spanish told them i was the new shortstop from the dominican  hows hank doin lousy  around your fingernails that swelling its called clubbing  hippocrates noticed that a lot of his friends who also had that  tended to frequently grab their chests and die  yeah i got a heart condition whats wrong with hank  what do you take for it digitalis  got em with you  huh well thats weird  i just filled this prescription a couple days ago theres another bottle here  dont bother  hank wiggen stole your pills  he tried to kill himself  so what happened  he left the bottle open while he went to get some water  next time just take the whole bottle  hey man you got no right  see people remember how many theyve got  dates right on the label number of pills regular person can do the math  but a junkie doesnt have to because how many pills hes got left thats all hes thinking about  big insurance policy     this isnt about the money  not for you no  most reputable stores wont cash your checks after youre dead  but for lola well girls like that theyre all about the money  dont you say that  she already saved my life  i was dead in japan she brought me back everything since then thats gravy  thats more than i deserve  you owe her everything  ah so the attempted suicide  the scaring her to death what is that thats gratitude  love  yeah i get that  well take out what you did to yourself yesterday were back to the kidneys and the bones  im scheduling the transplant       never visit a patient  i want that baby  even if im gone thats a piece of me and lola  breathing walking around town  gointo baseball games  if theres any more transplant talk from you lola or anybody else  i wont screw it up this time  ill take myself out for good  ill start treating the addisons which will most likely destroy whats left of your kidneys  fine start the treatment    hey  what hank wiggen peed on me  what do you think these pants are worth on ebay  ive got some big boy diapers in my office the rep hands em out like candy  is it that bad no not if you like the smell of urine  of course why should i trust someone who lies about what hes doing friday night  question is what are you really doing friday night  or more to the point what could possibly be better than monster trucks  or are we breaking up    stacys coming into town this weekend  were having dinner  just catching up  i definitely had pants here  wait a second is that stacy the stripper  i heard shes playing atlantic city  no stacy the constitutional lawyer  you thought i couldnt handle this news  you talk to her a lot  no its been a long time   if you dont want me to see her  what is this eighth grade im fine  its fine if youre upset  no its  i have no right to be upset  you two were friends  you should see her  say hi for me  so youre okay  im not the cancer doctor whos lying about the cancer dinner  im not the one betraying all those poor little baldheaded dying kids  im gonna go get some pants i stink  youre treating him for addisons and you dont think its gonna work  he tried to kill himself i know  hes confused we can have another baby i can make him understand that  im having an abortion we do the transplant no  i can make decisions about my body  and he can make decisions about his he doesnt want your kidney  so hell die  probably  if you keep that appointment hell also probably die  keep the baby  are you just being polite  my pants are  oh theyre all wet  you cant smell that  you think shell abort anyway try to force his hand  no shes not gonna risk losing him   thats funny  no the monster trucks house asking you thats thats funny  i was the first person he ran into he just asked me  yeah like a date  exactly except for the date part  if the patient decides to go the dialysis route weve got some product you should check out  mmm hey dr foreman  courtesy of the generous sharon and the good folks at castine pharmaceuticals  i was just telling the guys about the bermuda conference in april  three days of sun and scuba and one hour oflecture  oh god do we have to go to the lecture  so youre the new arnie  dr house its good to see you  would you get me a coffee black no sugar  okay so who is it  come on shes sleeping with one of you  oh god please tell me its you  she buys lunches she doesnt  dont worry youre not gay youre adventurous  you think shes gonna prostitute herself the three of us are that important to her  im afraid not no  the groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to mick  and youre mick that was the metaphor i was making yes  why are you here  damn its you  its not addisons new symptom inability to smell  i was just in hanks room  he said it smelled like the mens room at veterans stadium he was right  we rejected environmental causes because the wife was healthy  well shes not last six months she cant smell a thing  if you think of them as one single patient you add her symptoms to his  cadmium poisoning  it explains everything even why they had so much trouble getting pregnant  how could they have gotten exposed to that much cadmium  unless they were eating steel and batteries for breakfast  so where else is cadmium some foods polluted groundwater  we should check their home i think i know how it happened  im gonna need another urine sample  what for sure   whatever you want  why wouldnt you give it to me before but now its no problem   im dyin right  so youve got nothing to lose this time  begs the question what were you worried about last time  the funny thing is when we tested you before we were just looking for steroids  what should we look for now hank  hank whats the story  a little weed every now and then when no one was looking  i dont believe this   we quit  you did  if youd kept going you wouldnt have just lost your sense of smell  i quit the hard stuff   i just needed to relax  based on the symptoms youre a lot more than a social user  so youve been lying to me all this time im sorry  there must have been cadmium in the soil where the marijuana was grown  some people get bone loss kidney failure some peoples testes shrink  and some people lose their sense of smell  well start treatment right away  you should be fine by opening day  baseballs in the summer right  it didnt hurt the baby did it the cadmium   if youve been clean the baby should be fine  okay  please ill stop everything ill ill go to meetings every day  lola  twice a day  hows the ballplayer doing  much better too bad about his career  what do you mean  major league baseballs collective bargaining agreement  requires medical reports on all treatment  given hanks history hes not likely to get much leniency  why should they care that hes being treated for addisons  youre not treating him for addisons my report says i am  youre lying on the report  well everybody does stupid things  it shouldnt cost them everything they want in life  no it shouldnt but it usually does  on the other hand if it means someone can actually beat the yankees  so what about house is there any way we can get him down there  you really wanna talk about work  no not at all     that was amazing  im telling you grave digger never disappoints  you ever been married  well now lets not ruin a lovely night out by getting personal  i lived with someone for a while  you gonna finish that      ill race you to the car  thats some bad hat harry
