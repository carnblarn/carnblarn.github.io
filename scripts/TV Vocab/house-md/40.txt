                                hannah are you okay    still cant sleep  im fine  can i do anything to help you  just go back to sleep i wanna go get a glass of wine   i can keep you company  you have work in the morning  are you sure you dont want me to  ill be right back just sleep  hannah  hannah  whatd you do  i just wanted to sleep  im calling an ambulance   original airdate fox 18 apr2006        youve seen one patient in the last two hours  complicated case  im a night owl  wilsons an early bird  we are different species  then move him into his own cage  wholl clean the droppings for mine  with sleep issues  i guess shes  oh whats the medical term  upset  completely rational they rocks really  aghhh  my theory seems to be supported by the fact she swallowed a bottle of sleepng pills  get her a shrink i need some shuteye  shes a little bit more than upset  she hasnt slept in 10 days  shes lying  without rem sleep your neurons stop regenerating  your brain shuts down lobe by lobe  shed be insane after 5 days dead by 10  give me a little credit i know what gets you off  she took the pills to sleep not to kill herself  clever alibi  they didnt work  she stayed awake even though she downed the whole bottle  and the longest anyones ever survived without sleep is 11 days  which gives you 22 hours  you stole my article  i wouldnt do that  i wrote up the case where we induced hyperthermic cardiac arrest in the terminal cancer girl  i wrote my own i didnt steel yours  you knew i was writing one you gave me notes  got a case  it can wait you two finish   fine youre only putting off the inevitable  hasnt slept for 10 days  i assume the er tried giving her some sedatives we should up the dosage  sedation isnt the same as sleep  thanks for your insight  for someone who hasnt slept in 10 days sedation is a great start  sleep is an active process  reboots the system restores the brain sedatives dont  the brain is being stressed we need to relieve that  youve had my article on your desk for the last 4 months  im a very slow reader  no fever no white count means no infection  schizophrenia  no delusions  you read his  signed it didnt read it  aside from the sleeping pills tox screen was clean  no cocaine methamphetamines or diet pills  only medicatiosn shes had recently are steroids for poison ivy and ibuprofen for a knee she hurt skiing  nothing that would cause sleep disturbances   when did you get his article  uh about 3 weeks ago  lets go back to the beginning  how far back  genesis  god said let there be light  sleep is initially contrlled by external light cues  and if her brain cant interpret those cues  optic nerve disease  im sensing another article  ill go run the test  im injecting a dye which will allow us to take a look at your retina and your optic nerve  everythings  kinda blurry  normal because of the dye its gonna be that way next few hours  need a hand  no  were never gonna work together again  just dont see the need to make you feel better by forgiving you  i wasnt asking for forgiveness i was asking if you needed help  its unprofessional to be talking about this in front of the patient myabe that doesnt matter to you but  doesnt matter shes not listening  shes asleep  normal stage one brain waves  maybe shes better  still blurry  you fell asleep  no i didnt  negative for optic nerve desease  but she sleeps  for like 10 seconds maximum 1 minute  we also checked the ocular pressure its normal  and she doesnt know she sleeps  brain  is often aware of stage one sleep  ct showed no tumers no clots no seizure disorder  so  she sleeps she just cant stay asleep  you going somewhere with this  you know what keeps me awake at night  monsters in the closet  theres no monster in the closet we looked  well its certainly not showing up on the scans  wheres cameron  she felt i could deliver the news on my own  oh this is going to work out great  come on  if you two guys cant play nice together ill take away your toys  i dont care whose fault this is   if you hadnt  especially i dont care if it was my fault  whatever this woman has its not showing upon our tests  which means shes sick  just not sick enough for us to see it  you want us make her sicker  yes  i wanna stress her body specifically her brain  keep her awake  depriving her of even the 5 minutes of sleep she does have its torture  so is cutting people with knives  but you can totally get away with that if you havea doctor coat on  house those few seconds of sleep maybe the only reason she s still alive  more symptom we can force out her the more tests we can do  the more tests we do the more information we get the quicker we make a diagnosis  see how much more fun it is when you guys get along  you two take the first 4 hours  hannah  hannah  you fell asleep  no i didnt  your brain doesnt remember it was just a few seconds  max is this really necessary  the sooner we find out whats wrong the sooner she can get a real nights rest  hannah  hannah  hannah  ow  what did you do that for   you fell asleep again  no i didnt   we are sorry  we have to do this  we dont have to be cruel  you know what happens when youre nice nothing  thats how you define nice not stealing  doctors  foreman she fall asleep again    we got rectal bleeding  what all of you  so monster is peeking out from under the bed  which either means she has a clotting disorder or she has a tumer in her colon  chase ill do a colonoscopy  whos keeping her awake now  we figured once we found another symptom it really didnt matter  yeah hes got all the ideas  who is with her  her partners donating blood so shes with a nurse  probably singing her lullabies i want her awake  you have to sedate a patient to do a colonoscopy  why just because of the pain  if you find a tumar in her colon you can knock her out if you dont she stays awake  aghhh god it hurts   cant you hurry  trust me you dont want me to hurry  god youre killing me   hold my hand  keep breathing nice and steady  how am i supposed to work with him  um maybe we shouldnt be talking about this right now  you think im overreacting  um i need you to relax your anus  we are not here we are skiing  its thanksgiving at vail  you want me to think about nearly killing myself on a snowboard  come on you never fell  you were awesome  is that what you told him im hysterical and i need to relax my anus  i told him how many cases do we work up in the year  theyre all weird he couldve written up any one of them  shes bleeding  i cant breathe i cant breathe  hold on  we packed her nose to control the bleed and started transfusing 2 units of whole blood  the pathologyfrom the rectal bleed showed traces of nasal epithelium  so the butt bleeds just a nose bleed  that much blood is not a just a anything  when two people fight this much  you know what it means  its gotta be a massive sinus hemorrhage that was draining down her throat and out the back  the question isnt what its why  oh get a room  rat poison mixed with some sort of neurogenic toxin could cause bleeding and sleep disturbances  do you have a specific type of neurogenic toxin in mind  or should we just start running a thousand different tox screens  just pretend im not here ill be reading  it could also be some type of coagulopathy  or could be us do you have any idea what it feels like to have a 6footlong hose shoved into your large intestine  no but i now havea much greater respect for whichever basketball player you dated in college  weve basically been torturing this girl for the last eight hours  weve been poking her foot not punching her face  extreme stress can cause high blood pressure which can cause bleeding  wouldnt keep her awake for 10 days  what if the poison ivy wasnt poison ivy  she got the rash that was diagnosed as poison ivy around the same time the insomnia started  rash  nose bleed  sleep distuvance equals wegeners granulomatosis  start corticosteroid treatment  the poison ivy treatment was steroids  much lower dosage  get her back on the juice triple the dose  get a canca and upper airway biopsy to confirm wegeners    she has uh menstrual problems  they are really bad the pain keeps her in bed all day  plus shes super depressed  she said super depressed  she heard that birth control pills can make her feel better  she wants birth control pills   for her pms premenstrual syndrome  i guess  judging by the redness around your moms nostrils and the tissue  shes got conveniently stashed inside her wrist and id say her problem is more likely a uri  not a pms   uri  upper respiratory infection  a cold  i dont think so  i also think shes got a problem with sac  sac  thanks for palying stupid american child  if you want the pill  all you have to do is to walk into any health clinic in jersey alone and ask for it  what exactly was your plan  were you going to exchange the birth control pills for some  overthecounterdecongestants and hope that your moms cold lasts another 6 years  no   is that for her cold  no thats for your ovaries  i assume you havent had a stroke have you had a blood clot  no  super  each 3 months when you need a refill take a bus to a free clinic  dont wait around hoping for mom to get another sniffle  not the sharpest chopstick in the drower is she    was this just one of your experiments  you just wanted to see how id react being screwed over by foreman  nice idea but no  it was just good oldfashioned laziness  gotta hand it to foreman though  he knew that youre a suckup and i dont give a crap  he successfully exploited us both  right were both victims  a simple heads up thats all i needed  maybe between your incredibly witty remarks about anal sex and cuddys breasts you could have tip me off  then id have foreman pissed at me  and as annoying as you could be  at least youre not gonna pop a cap in my ass  witty huh  you on the other hand  continue to be flabbergasted every time someone actually acts like a human being  foreman did what he did cause it worked out best that way for him  thats what everyone does  that is not the definition of being human  thats the definition of being an ass  this will numb you up  and  this will keep your tongue out of the way  dont worry you shouldnt feel anything except for slight pulling  so you think i was out of line  that article would set on houses desk for the next 6 years  i  could have told her  you couldve written it for too  she knows house as well as any of us  you shouldve known she was waiting for to do something she was never gonna do  chase  hannah sill with us  whats wrong with her eyes  foreman it looks like rem   whats that  rapid eye movements  thats what your eyes do when youre sleeping  but shes awake  hannah  hannah can you hear me  yeah off course  was she sitting up or lying down   sitting up  then it wasnt rem  chase says her eyes are moving the exact way  did you start her on steroids   not yet we were still doing the  but she wasnt sleeping  how do you know  cause we havent done anything yet  she may be able to sleep with her eyes open but unless you also discovered shes got two extra tits and her hooves for feet  theres no way shed be able to maintain enough muscle tensity during rem sleep to sit upright  its a movement disdorder  which rules out wegeners  wheres foreman   keeping her awake  good  rabies could cause muscle spasms malaise anxiety and wakefulness  pretty unlikely she forget being bitten by a crazed animal  she couldve been exposed through an open wound  she have a dog  for less than a week she had an allergic reaction so they had to give it away  allergies  animal allergies seemed unlikely but its possible that   when  when what  when did she get rid of the dog  about a month ago her girlfriend gave it to her for her birthday  well then its not allergies  shes  just leaving her girlfrined  you spoke to the dog  if her birthday was a month ago she wouldve still been on steroids for the poison ivy  those meds wouldve suppressed any reaction she mightve had to the dog  which means she lied about being allergic  dogs a commitment  you pretend to be allergic because you dont wanna tell your girlfriend  that youre not planning on being around that long  so i think we can move onto options other than allergies  we should still do a scratch test if shes allergic to one thing  she is not allergic  okay well we could either base our diagnosis on your admittedly keen understanding of lesbian relationships  or we could do a scratch test  do a scratch test    you still feeling a lot of blood in your throat  no its actually getting a little better  good maybe things are just starting to improve on their own  just a few more    you want some water to wash out your mouth  no im okay  come on that cant taste good im gonna get you a soda   its okay isnt it  mmhmm  you and max seem to have a really nice relationship   yeah  shes very supportive  uhhuh  when max got you the dog did you lie about having an allergic reaction  no  why  if you have preexisting conditions its important we know  but if you dont its just as important   if im wasting my time doing this allergy test  youre not gonna tell her are you  its none of my business  shes a good person and then  weve just been together so long i  im tired of her  sounds terrible doesnt it  i guess it happens sometimes  oh my back hurts  hannah can you turn over  whats wrong  im not sure  oh my god  she has massive internal bleeding  chase did she have access to aspirin  shed have to take a hell of a lot  why not considering her current mental state  what about her mental state  you were right about her wanting to break up  that just means i was right doesnt mean shes suicidal  a bottle of pills is what landed her here in the first place  sleeping pills  god knows why shed want them  what else can cause sleep disorder and internal bleeding  drugs or alcohol can mess with the sleeping and compromise the liver  what are you doing here whos keeping her awake  doesnt matter  liver function tests are through the sky  livers not compromised its dead  she doesnt need a diagnosis she needs a new liver  shes not getting a new liver unless we can figure out whats wrong with her  test for cirrhosis 12 hours test for hepatitis 8  her livers not gonna last another 6  so your advice is we just give up  my advice is that we narrow our focus to conditions that we can diagnose treat and cure in less than 6 hours  and theres nothing on that list  the girlfriend donated blood right  yeah so  it means that theyre the same type  you cant ask the person shes about to dump to donate half her liver  it does seem tacky doesnt it  im dr hosue  im in charge of your case  whats going on  how come no one is keeping her awake anymore  youre in acute liver failure  we can continue the transfusions and the lactulose  but its only a stopgap  theres really nothing we can do to stop the toxins from building up in your bloodstream  which means that in a few hours  you will lapse into a coma  and you wont wake up  im sorry  thats it you are giving up youre  not gonna figure out whats doing this to her  even with the right diagnosis any treatments gonna take longer than the time she has left  if its her liver cant she get a transplant  wouldnt work without a diagnosis  whatever killed the first liver would do the same to the second  but it would it would give you more time to make the diagnosis to get her better  well it might give us an extra day or two but  no procurement agency is gonna let a liver go to a patient with an undiagnosed preexisting  hannah and i have the same blood type  couldnt i be the donor  it is medically possible for us to take a part of your  please i dont care about the risks  youre very lucky to have such a devoted partner  i just bought us 36 hours  differential diagnosis  which monster eats your liver screws up your sleep and causes bleeding  does max know hannah plans to leave her  didnt come up so i guess no  if she knew theres no way shed go through with this  and if you didnt have a pathological need to create a close personal relationship  with every dying person you meet we would be blissfully ignorant of any ethical dilemmas  and might actually be able to concentrate on the differential  scratch test was negative  its rare bet any of the hepatitis viruses could cause sleep disturbances and liver failure  no pcrs were normal   we have an ethical dilemma  no we dont  continue  what about splenic cancer or nonhodgkins lymphoma shes the right age  could explain the bleeding maybe the liver failure  were withholding information relevant to her decision to risk her life  how is that not an ethical dilemma  its not medical information   who cares  the ama  wilsons disease could explain liver and neurological symptoms  it also causes bleeding disorders  no kayserfleischer rings in her eyes  rings dont have to be there if theres neurological symptoms   this is immoral  look lets say youre right  we tell she changes her mind our patient dies  how is that moral  what else  poison mushrooms can cause liver failure sleep disturbances and internal bleeding  shes not shrooming shes a sports nut  right skiers never party  shes doing this out of love and max doesnt know  its only moral to save a person if they love you  its kind of a selfish way of looking at life  i like wilsons disease like cancer love mushrooms  yeah but we dont have the time to test for any of it  before she can get the transplant we need to do about 80 procedures  so do those tests and my tests at the same time  use the pet to look for cancer and wilsons while you endoscope her bile ducts scrape her stomach for mushroom spores  one of you ct her liver while the other two check proteins ca125 and ca195  oh yeah anyone says anything to max  theyre fired   we have to  we have to not  because shes not our patient  shes getting surgery shes someones patient  calvin and sam great thank you  need a little help  inexplicable rash on a patients scrotum you need me to look at  to donate half her liver to her dying girlfriend  thats very generous  this is sleepless girl whats she got  liver failure  sort of figured that out when you said she needed a new liver  you dont have a diagnosis  transplant buys me time  lets just skip the part where i say this is insane  it was her idea  if she wants to be an idiot its her call  you dont need me  just have one of your team walk her through the process  the donor and the donee sort of have opposing interests right  you cant really advise them both  youre concerned about the ethics of this  whats going on what do you know  nothing medically relevant  but you know something and it is relevant  if i cant tell her i cant really tell you can i  not if youre advising her  i assume this information is in the medical file   my patients confidential file  this hospitals file  you can either satisfy your curiosity  or you can remain ignorant do nothing ethically wrong  and my patient doesnt die in three hours  these tests and the counseling normally happen over weeks  sometimes months  its okay  well the most important part were skipping is time  time for you to change your mind  i dont want to change my mind  not now but with time and perspective maybe we learn things  if we had the time wed take the time but we dont  so can you get this over with  either i sign off on this or it doesnt happen  so i need you to listen to me  because theres a chance that you will die on that table  i just want me and hannah to be able to lie in bed together  as old ladies compare scars  i need you to lie on your side and hold your knees  im gonna check for vascular abnormalities that might prevent us from doing the transplant  at the same time im also checking for mushroom spores to see if thats the underlying  i dont do mushrooms  you lie about your love life maybe you lie about drugs open  arent you at all concerned about what max is going through right now  theyre shoving a tube up her rectum  theyre gonna swab her stomach just like im doing  its going to hurt just like this hurts  which is nothing at all like the risk shes taking on the table  you really dont love her do you  im not leaving her because i dont  im not talking about the leaving im talking about this  if you care for her at all you wont let her do this blind   youd really tell  yeah  youd die  take it youve seen that  seen it digested it watched it blow up my entire department   you read camerons version  didnt read either  it was good  better than foremans  maybe he was more analytical about the diagnostic procedures  she concentrated more on the ethical dilemmas of informed consent  how any patient can really be informed without a medical degree  same old party lines  foreman shouldve told her  oh shoulda woulda coulda  if you allow this sort of thing in your department youre basically saying its okay  no im saying that i dont care what they do as long as my life isnt interrupted by pointless conversations like this one  they wont trust each other and they wont trust you  they shouldnt  deception like this is just one step removed from actively sabotaging one another  then what would you do  i could be the kindest gentlest boss in the world  and foreman wouldve still done what he did because thats who he is  we can only hope that cameron has learned something  right because youre all about the teaching  our children are the future  hey  cuddy cleared max for surgery shes okay to go   hows our patient  shes also cleared  i dont care about the prep i care about the diagnostic tests  well it looks negative for wilsons disease well know for surein an hour   blood proteins are normal its not  wheres cameron  taking a sample of the bile duct  surgeries are supposed to start in about 15 minutes  she had a chance to get one last  hannah and max will be in the same room  you wanted us to do as much as we can before  theyre both awake with cameron  maybe we should give these two a minute together before the surgery  you ready honey  max  its okay im right here   i need you to know something  i know i love you too  i dont know how to say this  good lord  you can tell me anything  she hasnt slept in eleven days you people trying to torture her  ding ding lets go   i told you not  i didnt say a word to max  this is exactly why you got screwed with foreman  youre looking for people to do the right thing  she hasnt slept her judgments compromised due to inactivity in her prefrontal cortex  oh she could have the best prefrontal cortex in the history of mankind  but given the choice of life versus death those bad bad people are going to choose life  then whyd you sedate her  if she wasnt gonna tell if she was never gonna do the right thing why bother knocking her out  this isnt about them if she talks if she does the decent thing  then you dont get to solve your puzzle your games over you lose  yeah i want to save her im morally bankrupt  hows it going  theyre about to remove hannahs liver  all right im good to go  you can start removing maxs liver  cuddy you want to let me in on what the big secret is between these two  you read foremans article  it was good  he basically stole it from me  so  youre on his side  sides no this isnt dodgeball  what am i supposedto do just sit backand take it  no write another article  kick ass until youre sitting behind some big expensive desk and someone from johns hopkins calls and says  were thinking about hiring eric foreman as our head of neurology  and you can say whatever you want  lovely revenge as motive for success  well it doesnt have to be the motive  but it sure tastes good  shes in vf ive got no pulse  shes arresting  paddles  ugh i am so relieved you two are here  without you looking out theyd be playing foosball down there  maxs heart stopped  your patient is on the other side  get yourself upstairs and figure out what hannah has or max has risked her life for nothing  charging  clear  were okay  chase maxs cardiac arrest was caused by hypoxia from hypoventilation  they restarted her heart and the right lobe of her liver was successfully transplanted into hannah  now where were we before we were so rudely interrupted by the liver transplant  dopa decarboxylase was processed normally and the ceroloplasmaand copper levels were normal  so no wilsons disease  gastric content was negative for spores so no mushroom toxicity  and the initial tests were negative for cancer   which cancer were you looking for  any of them  we ran blood tests for ovarian lung and lymphomas  its not gonna tell you much  her blood was taken after she was given immunosuppressants  they fight rejection they also mess up our ability to get any clear readings  great battles kick up a lot of dirt  obscure the battlefield so generals cant see whats going on  so what are your orders general house  sound the retreat  how ya feeling  is max okay  shes still unconscious but her vitals look good  we need to stop all the immunosuppressant drugs which are protecting your new liver  but if you stop the drugs ill die  youre dead anyway if we dont figure out what caused all this  by removing any outside influences itll help us see whats really going on with your body  so you did all this to buy me a couple of days and now youre taking em back  will it hurt  as your body goes into acute organ rejection  your liver will begin to swell itll put pressure on  yeah itll hurt we can knock you out  mm no if max wakes up i want to talk to her  shes been taking the decongestants but shes not getting better she also says  what  her boobs are bigger  ugh how could you get them mixed up  they come in a little wheel they dont look anything like decongestants  oh god the cashier put them both in the same bag i thought i gave her the right ones      no you gave her the wrong pills  you speak mandarin  i can count to ten ask to goto the bathroom and    im not pregnant wewe havent even done it yet  okay im going to leave you two alone now  im sure you got a lot to talk about  fevers 106 shes in full rejection mode  is that supposed to surprise me  her white count is normal  normal is not normal  shes been on steroids  transplant team gave her a cocktail of immunosuppressants  she hasnt slept in over a week  her white count should be in the tank  looks like the problem is some sort of infection  probably caused a hypotension shocked the liver  we should start broad spectrum antibiotics  yeah you might want to add some chicken soup  itd be just as useless but its got chicken  we need to know exactly what kind of infection were dealing with  what infection causes sleep disturbance bleeding  movement disorder organ failure and an abnormally normal white count   what about tularemia  chest was clear  tularemia doesnt cause movement disorders  it would if she developed meningitis  there was no ulcerations on the skin  with the bleeding it looks more like leptospirosis  without conjunctivitis and elevated creatinine  what about typhoid or some kind of relapsing fever  makes sense if we were in the sudan  we sure she hasnt been out of the country  she hasnt even been out of the state in at least a year neither has max  maybe she lied  you talk to her friends neighbors  you dont know  come on if you dont stay up to date on my notes wheres your next article gonna come from  you talk to the dog  were not as upon foreign languages as you are  ha has the dog been traveling   it came from a breeder  where  i dont know  a place called blue barrel kennels  they only had the thing for like two days  blue barrel is a kind of cactus  you see many cacti in jersey  want to seea magic trick  oh no whered it go whered it go  is it here  no what about here  there it is  aw that doesnt look anything like a nose  cameron that wasnt there this morning  get that to the lab and call cdc  and tell them what  that we have a patient with the plague  the black plague  looks that way  plague is carried by rodents not dogs  where theres dogs theres fleas  and if they hail from the southwest  and those fleas cant tell the difference between prairie dogs and puppy dogs  a small percentage of plague cases present with sleep disturbance  imagine an idyllic river of bacteria  okay its not idyllic for her but it serves my purposes  the steroids and immunosuppressants acted like a big honkin dam across the river  physics 101 put a dam up in front of a raging river the river rises  by stopping the immunosuppressants  we blew up the dam and a 100foot wall of bacteria flooded her lymph nodes  we better find out where that dog is now  after we start the immunosuppressants  and fill her up to the eyeballs with streptomycin sulfate gentamicin and tetracycline  use a garden hose if youve got one  get yourselves some prophylactic treatments as well  ive got the plague  dont worry its treatable  being a bitch though nothing we can do about that  you werent in your room  the surgeon said id heal faster if i walk  got this far needed a rest  what you did was crazy but it was pretty amazing too  yeah im a hero  shes been planning to leave me  really  she told a friend the friend let it slip  you knew and you gave up half your liver anyway  she cant leave me now  you really want her to stay out of guilt thats not gonna make either of you happy  you dont know that  i love her  i just want her to stay  i dont own houses cases  you had just as much right as i did to write it up  you shoulda told me but i shoulda handled it better too  if we want this not to get in the way of our friendship  i think we both have to apologize and  put it behind us  i like you really  we have a good time working together  but ten years from now  were not gonna be hanging out having dinners  maybe well exchange christmas cards  say hi give a hug if were at the same conference   were not friends  were colleagues  and i dont have anything to apologize for
