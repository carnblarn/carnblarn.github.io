fever  im just worried i might be contagious   inventory tomorrow imyeah im sure ill be feeling better by then  thanks mr innabe   i cannot believe you just did that  li really do have a cough  oh so you werent lying  youd be curled up in bed with a bowl of chicken soup   even if you didnt have a horny girl in your bed  yes  because i really do hey  i really do have a cough you also have a little rash   um im not sure we should be kissing  oh  its okay because i have almost no interest in kissing you  perfect  good  uhuhuh   oh baby            oh brandon   brandon   i know im good but come on  brandon  brandon brandon brandon  brandon brandon   any additional rn to surgical any additional rn to surgical       why do you want me to treat this guy  blood pressures not responding to iv fluids  no no i didnt ask how you plan to con me into treating him  i asked you why you want me to treat him  hes sick i care im pathetic  there are about a billion sick people on the planet why this one  because this ones in our emergency room ah so its a proximity issue  if somebody was sick in the thirdfloor stairwell thats whod we be talking about  yes i checked the stairwell its clear  okay then emergency room guy it is   wait why was that so easy you know why   blood pressures not responding to iv fluids  yeah  thats just weird  cbc was unremarkable abdominal ct scan didnt show anything  so people differential diagnosis whats wrong with her   him  him her does it matter  does anyone think its a testicular problem no so chase   yersinia infection  no you wouldnt get the rash or cough  what about arthritis accompanying vasculitis causes nerve damage   no it wouldnt cause the blood pressure problems allergy  the kids got abdominal pain  maybe carcinoid no but then you wouldnt get the  foreman if youre going to list all the things its not it might be quicker to do it alphabetically  lets see now absidia excellent doesnt account for any of the symptoms   no condition accounts for all these symptoms  oh good  because i thought maybe he was sick but apparently hes not  who wants to do up the discharge papers    okay unless we control the blood pressure  hes gonna start circling the drain before we can figure out whats wrong with him  treat him for sepsis broadspectrum antibiotics and i want a cortstim test and an echocardiogram     you all right  yeah  the cortstim test will tell us if your pituitary and adrenal glands are working properly   his glands what does that mean  we have a few theories were working on   you mean you dont know  mindy  im just saying if they knew they wouldnt be testing you theyd be treating you  yeah well thats the way it works first we find out what it is then we get you better  youre half an hour late busy caseload  one case is not a load  so how are we doing on cotton swabs today if theres an acute shortage i could run home  no you couldnt nice  hello sick people and their loved ones  in the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot ofboring chitchat later im dr gregory house  you can call me greg im one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning  short sweet grab a file this ray of sunshine is dr lisa cuddy  dr cuddy runs this whole hospital so unfortunately shes much too busy to deal with you  i am a boardcertified diagnostician  with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology  im also the only doctor currently employed at this clinic who is forced to be here against his will  that is true isnt it but not to worry  because for most of you this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of motrin  speaking of which if youre particularly annoying you may see me reach for this  this is vicodin its mine you cant have any  and no i do not have a pain management problem i have a pain problem  but who knows maybe im wrong maybe im too stoned to tell  so who wants me  and who would rather wait for one of the other two guys  okay well ill be in exam room one if you change your mind  jodi matthews  please accompany dr house to exam room one  dr chase  im not sure scaring your boyfriend is the best medicine for him right now  i know i get stupid when im scared dont go rock climbing  look i was wondering before this happened we were having sex   what youre wondering if whatever he has you mightve gotten it  itits unlikely we ran a complete std panel so  no im wondering if maybe i did this to him i was kind of rough  it was yellow it was  its not anymore well thats a shame  i thought that might be a problem so i brought you this  your mucus was pale goldenrod  last week yes should i be worried oh yes very  really i thought it was okay now  and yet here you are what happened  paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call  youre not a very nice doctor are you  and you are very bad at whatever it is you do  you dont even know me i know youre gonna get fired  thats why you got the new glasses thats why your teeth are sparkly white  youre getting the most of your health insurance while you still can  i might be quitting   if you were quitting youd have known that last week when your snot was still pale goldenrod youre getting fired  i just dont like being told what to do  i can get you in for a full body scan later this week  thanks  its got to be viral we should start running gels and titers  maybe we should look into the girlfriends theory she thinks she rode him to death   whatd you tell her  i told her 22yearold men dont die of sex   whatd you ask her  what do you mean  i mean i hope you got some specifics on exactly what was going on  if the girl thinks it could kill you its worth knowing about  have you ever taken a life  we should stop the antibiotics  its too soon to say theyre not having an effect  theyre having an effect  his bp s falling fast theres fluid filling his lungs  his creatinine is rising  his kidneys are shutting down  our treatment isnt making him better its killing him  so we had six symptoms that didnt add up to anything now we got seven whos excited  i dont think it complicates things the kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics   maybe  typically low blood pressure and abdominal pain means an infection  an abdominal infection causes sepsis low blood pressure  except we checked for abdominal infections  but what if its the other way around what if the low blood pressures causing the abdominal pain  viral heart infection the intestines arent getting enough blood and the result is belly pain   i know its not the standard presentation  its a 10 millionto1 shot  i thought thats what we dealt with here  it explains the cardiomyopathy the pain the low bp the fever  you read the book impressive  its a ludicrously long shot that explains every one of those symptoms except for the cough and the rash  should we just erase those well anything can cause a rash  okay cardiac infection   cameron you thought allergy  mmhmm  chase what was it you thought carcinoid  then theres hypothyroidism  could be parasites  finally sinus infection  if youre gonna list all the things it cant be youre gonna need more colors  cameron was right no condition explains all these symptoms   but orange and green covers everything  orange and green  two conditions contracted simultaneously  occams razor the simplest explanation is always the best   and you think one is simpler than two  pretty sure it is yeah  baby shows up chase tells you that two people exchanged fluids to create this being  i tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper are you gonna go with the two or the one   i think your argument is specious  i think your tie is ugly  why is one simpler than two its lower lonelier is it simpler  each one of these conditions is about a thousandtoone shot  that means that any two of them happening at the same time is a milliontoone shot  chase says the cardiac infection is a 10 millionto1 shot  which makes my idea  get a calculator run the numbers  well run the tests tests take time  treatments quicker start the kid on unasyn for the sinus infection  and what was orange  hypothyroidism  my uncle has hypothyroidism not like this  intravenous levothyroxin is an artificial thyroid medication that should take care of it  also the nurses are going to start you on unasyn its a more targeted antibiotic  for the sinus infection yes   the other stuff is for something else entirely  bad luck huh  dont worry he should be back to ditching work in no time  brandon  hey mom   were his parents hows he doing  um brandon is  uh mom dad this is mindy  i was gonna bring her home for christmas um were engaged   dr hall to the recovery room dr hall  did you tell the family houses theory  two odd conditions striking completely coincidentally at the exact same time  i didnt phrase it quite that way they agree to treatment  of course they did were doctors they believe whatever we tell them  so is that our job houses puppets  he comes up with an insane idea we get to pretend its not  his insane ideas are usually right weve been here long enough to  weve been here long enough to have stockholm syndrome   what because we dont hate him he thinks outside the box is that so evil  he has no idea where the box is  if you guys think hes right go home relax just wait for the kid to get all better  im going to the lab to test for viral infections    negative for coxsackie b virus  seven down about 5000 to go  you really think were gonna come up with your mystery virus just by running gels till we guess it right  no i think were gonna do it by standing around watching other people work  im waiting for the epsteinbarr virus   shes weird isnt she  bad idea   what  bad idea you work with her  what did i say  is weird some new ghetto euphemism for sexy like bad is good and phat is good   then what the hell does good mean  ghetto euphemism     you dont think shes hot  no  wow then youre brilliant and i am using brilliant as a euphemism  obviously the girl is hot yyoure not talking about her aesthetics  youre talking about if i want to jump her i dont  brilliant     your epsteinbarr is ready  what are you doing level four  no no i mean i know what you meant were waiting  my throat hurts so you said  how long are we waiting two minutes less than when you asked me two minutes ago   hi  hi im dr cuddy nice to meet you  dr cuddy thanks for the consult his throat seems to have some condition  say ah ah   he has a sore throat  of course yes why didnt l  i mean because he said that it hurt and i should have deduced that meant it was sore  i was in a board meeting patients come first right  wouldnt want to prescribe a lozenge if theres any doubt about its efficacy huh  you once asked me why i think im always right and i realized that youre right  at least i think youre right i dont really know now do i   hey im here  go home drink some hot tea   excellent counsel  negative on parvovirus b19  im impressed thank you i was born to run gels  i meant about chase what about chase  well the man has no physical interest in you  he has a completely professional relationship with you respects you as a colleague and a doctor  and yet he cant look at you without thinking sex  because i asked what kind of sex could kill you  you now have total control over your relationship with him  so a woman cant express her interest in sex without it being some professional power play  no if you look the way you do and you say what you said  you have to be aware of the effect that its going to have on men   men should grow up  yeah and dogs should stop licking themselves  its not gonna happen whats going on   yeah what are you doing here  looking for you guys   why didnt you page us  cause i knew youd be here  who told him no one  i assume youre trying to prove my crazy twoillness theory wrong so obviously youre gonna be in the lab   you spin the urine  not yet  talk to me when you have  whatd you find out kidney failure its acute interstitial nephritis   i wonder if thats significant  it means the antibiotics didnt cause the kidney failure  howd you know  if you guys hadnt been so busy trying to prove me wrong you mightve checked in on the poor kid  you visited a patient  i was sitting by his bed all morning just so hed know someone was there for him  i looked in on him hes much better  ergo the treatments working ergo me right you wrong  hey im glad for the kid  that smugness of yours really is an attractive quality thank you  it was either that or get my hair highlighted smugness is easier to maintain  i get that youre not a big believer in the catching flies with honey approach  but do you honestly think youll collect a jarful by cleverly taunting them  flies no doctors sure if id said to foreman  nice try great guess but sorry not this time what do you think hed be doing right now  i think hed go home not feeling like a piece of crap exactly  you want him to feel like a piece of crap no i dont want him going home  dr foreman   still have the cough im feeling a lot better though  his fever is gone his rash is going away   i see is everything okay  just ordering some tests absolutely nothing to worry about     how much longer  930 i figure she was on the eighth hole when i paged her  you probably got another half hour  i ran a tsh t3 and t4 the patients negative for hypothyroidism im not talking about you  the fact that hes getting better would indicate the unreliability of the tests  if im right and its a viral infection one of two things always happen  the patient dies or the patients immune system fights off the invader  whats with her  her leg hurts after running six miles who knows could be anything  hes getting better that doesnt prove youre right that just proves hes getting better  itits not two illnesses it cant be two illnesses  i am so glad you work here   if im right the antibiotics you prescribed  could box his kidneys and liver impeding his ability to fight off the virus   it could kill him  well that certainly would be a concern  fifty bucks  dont look away the space monkeys will be all over you   you wanna bet on the patients health  you think thats bad luck  you think that god will smite him because of our insensitivity  well if god does you make a quick 50        oh  go check his white blood count  if hes fighting off a virus like you think itll be way up  hey cuddy said you needed a consult whats up im busy  oh   i was just being glib  you havent said anything  no before when i was talking about brandons girlfriend thinking sex could kill you  i was just making a joke because i was uncomfortable  oh i dont even remember what you said im uncomfortable about sex   well we dont have to talk about this  sex could kill you  do you know what the human body goes through when you have sex  pupils dilate arteries constrict  core temperature rises heart races blood pressure skyrockets  respiration becomes rapid and shallow  the brain fires bursts of electrical impulses from nowhere to nowhere  secretions spit out of every gland  and the muscles tense and spasm like youre lifting three times your body weight  its violent its ugly and its messy  and if god hadnt made it unbelievably fun the human race wouldve died out eons ago  men are lucky they can only have one orgasm  you know that women can have an hourlong orgasm  hey foreman whats up   hey foreman  hey   white cell count isnt up is it  no we were both wrong  white cell count is down way downand dropping  his immune system is shot we need to get him into a clean room   can you walk brandon  yeah a little  okay cause well need to leave the chair outside thank you  wheres april april  can you take that chair please thank you yes robert  ill need to take your um your mask and your robe too  you might wanna block your ears for this its quite loud    somethings made him immunocompromised  his white blood cell count is down which means his body cant fight off infections  if he gets sick hell die sick how sick  lfhe gets a cold hell die    okay im gonna push the needle into your hip bone and take some of the marrow  thats not so bad  uhuh that was just the anesthetic   the core biopsy needle its a bit bigger  hey man take a deep breath thisthis is gonna hurt a lot    your marrow makes the blood cells  we take a peek at it under a microscope  and maybe we find a viral infection  maybe we find some fibrosis  something to explain why your blood count is so low  there we go  one step closer to an answer   if you dont find one  i cant stay here forever      the patient couldve died  the one with the pulled muscle  those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions    im entitled to a consult  you are not getting out of clinic duty  come on you got a hundred other idiot doctors in this building who go  all warm and fuzzy every time they pull a toy car out of a nose you dont need me here  no i dont but working with people actually makes you a better doctor  when did i sign up for that course when did i give you the impression that i care  working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion  ive got your home number right in case anything comes up at 300 in the morning  its not gonna work you know why  because this is fun  you think of something to make me miserable i think of something to make you miserable  its a game and im gonna win because i got a head start you are already miserable  uh is this important  uh no good  whats with you and her dont  you have a thing for her the only people who can get to you  no there is not a thin line between love and hate  there is in fact a great wall of china with armed sentries posted every 20 feet between love and hate  thirtysix vicodin whos the patient  i am you cant  dr wilson is the prescribing physician yeah  you will lie cheat and steal to get what you want but youre incapable of kissing a little ass   we all have our limitations  house wrong bottle do me a favor  take one of these wait five minutes for it to kick in then find cuddy and kiss her ass  what was the kids first symptom  you did the history of his 800 symptoms which one hit him first  uh the cough      gout  um are we talking about brandon gout  uric acid crystals in the joints  the symptoms are pain swelling redness stiffness not one of which do i see on that board  because he doesnt have gout   every day cells die  we survive because the remaining cells divide and replace the losses  the colchicine a gout medicine blocks mitosis and stops cell division  which will result in abdominal pain rash  nausea fever kidney failure low blood pressure  and will also mess with the bone marrow  but he doesnt have gout why would he have gout medication  because you guys were right he didnt have two conditions at the exact same time  first he got a cough and because hes an idiot he went to a doctor  in order to justify charging 200 that doctor felt he should actually do something  oops he wrote a prescription  seven thousand people die each year from pharmacy screwups  not nearly as many as die from doctor screwups  but still not something they use in their promotional materials  the pharmacist gave him gout medicine instead of cough medicine  and the only thing it wouldnt do  it would do absolutely nothing to relieve his cough  occams razor  the simplest explanation is almost always that somebody screwed up  but once he checked into this hospital he was completely in our control  our food our pills our everything  so even if youre right no more gout medication  hed either continue to deteriorate or he wouldve gotten better  but he got better and then he got worse  it doesnt fit it doesnt make sense  okay two people screwed up  not as simple as one but  hes resting hes im dr house  im your sons physician oh youre the one we havent met yet  youre the one he hasnt met how can you treat someone without meeting them  its easy if you dont give a crap about him  thats a good thing  if emotions made you act rationally well they wouldnt be called emotions right  thats why we have this nice division of labor you hold his hand i get him better  if i start tucking him in at night well thats not fair to you guys  and if you start prescribing medicine well thats not fair to me  so what i wanna know is who stepped on my side of the net  who cared enough to get stupid enough to give him his cough medicine  when we checked in dr foreman  tuesday hes getting better wednesday hes getting sick again  somebody gave him his cough medicine wednesday  come on nobodys gonna be mad  i just wanna know who tried to kill the kid   dr house maybe we should  his throat was sore  page dr occam hes gonna wanna hear about this im sorry  he was coughing and i just wanted to help him arent you a dear  where are the pills he took the last ofem before he was switched into that room  theyre all gone it was just cough medicine  no it wasnt wheres the bottle  we need to know exactly what you put in this bottle  we think it was colchicine a gout medication  if the prescription said cough medicine thats what i dispensed  the family is prepared to waive liability all right  we just need to know what it was what dosage it was it was cough medicine  refill it  hes gonna be okay you dont know that  does brandon like that quality in you  youre a little negative  things dont always work out for the best doesnt hurt to hope they do  no not unless that makes you figure you can do whatever you want like give people cough medicine  this is cough medication this is what brandon was supposed to get  theyre small round and yellow  can you tell this man what the pills in your sons medicine bottle actually looked like  they were small round and yellow exactly like this  those were the pills that brandon was taking  hey im just a pharmacist but i know what cough medicine looks like doctor   it was so perfect it was beautiful  beauty often seduces us on the road to truth  and triteness kicks us in the nads  so true this doesnt bother you  that you were wrong i try to work through the pain  i was not wrong everything i said was true it fit it was elegant   so reality was wrong   realitys almost always wrong  the cough medicine did something   aggravated the condition  its all over the place must be in his blood   what if it is his blood  lymphoma  unless youve got something better  we foolishly ruled out lymphoma because his ct scan showed no adenopathy  cbc showed a normal differensmear bone marrow showed no screw the tests  do an exploratory laparotomy and find out whats in there  he has no blood pressure no immune system and no kidneys surgery will kill him  yeah youre right lets stick with the wrong pill theory  ill schedule him for surgery   okay brandon were running this tube through your heart  and into the pulmonary arteries in your lungs   the sensors will give us information we need for the exploratory surgery later this afternoon   my fingers are numb  try not to move  were in the right atrium trying to catch the flow through the tricuspid valve   i think the catheters curling in the atrium  got it were in the rv now   ectopy   you mustve irritated the heart wall  itll calm down   he cant tolerate any cardiac arrhythmia pull back  he needs the surgery       pressures dropped   you still with us brandon  get the curtains  vf       charging clear      sinus rhythm  i got a pulse    yeah but no surgery today   howre you doing  okay  great im doing good too  i get to knock off an hour early today you know why  because i kissed my bosss ass do you ever do that  i think she just said yes cause she wants to reinforce that behavior  wants me to kiss a lot of other peoples ass like she wants me to kiss yours  what would you want a doctor who holds your hand while you die  or a doctor who ignores you while you get better  i guess it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die   i should go  you think its gonna come out on its own  are we talking bigger than a breadbasket  because actually it will come out on its own  which for small stuff is no problem its wrapped up in a nice soft package and plop  big stuff youre gonna rip something  which speaking medically is when the fun stops how did you  youve been here half an hour you havent sat down that tells me its location  you havent told me what it is that tells me its humiliating  you have a little birdie carved on your arm that tells me you have a high tolerance for humiliation  so i figure its not hemorrhoids  ive been a doctor 20 years youre not gonna surprise me   its an mp3 player  mm  is it is it because of the size or the shape  or is it the pounding bass line  what are we gonna do   im gonna wait  for what  okay its 300 im off  would you tell dr cuddy theres a patient in exam room two needs her attention  and the riaa wants her to check for illegal downloads  brandons not ready for surgery okay  lets leave it a couple of weeks he should be feeling better by then oh wait which way does time go  he crashed during prep hes also experiencing pain in his fingers  think some bug may have gotten in the clean room  i think we should double his dosage of gcsf to temporarily boost his white blood cell count  pain in his fingers right  hi again he cant  wheres he going   hey how you all doing  interesting fact every seven years its a whole new you inspiring metaphor huh  dr house this is a clean room yeah i read the sign  but cells of different organs reproduce at different rates     so you get a new kidney every three years  get a new stomach lining every week  this is why colchicine poisoning causes all these symptoms but not all at once  but we went to the pharmacy we saw the pills  colchicine does its damage in a very specific order  first of all theres the pain in the abdomen the rash the fever isnt that what you got first  then the kidneys go which is exactly what happened to   brandon  right  then it screws up your bone marrow and then neuropathy   a painful tingling in the fingers and toes  and what do you suppose happens after that   hair loss the bad news is  your special boy is doing drugs  no hes not  ecstasy no   twice with dan and mike  you know what they cut that stuff with  apparently colchicine unless you ingested the colchicine through your contact lens solution  or skin cream or some other drug youre lying about  i dont know how it happened i dont care how it happened it happened start uh   brandon  lovely name  start brandon on fab fragments and get him some tylenol for the hair i pulled out  and get some air in here  make a note i should never doubt myself  i think youll remember you know it wouldnt hurt you to be wrong every now and then  what you dont care about these people    the colchicine interferes with the ability of the heart muscle to contract  pumping blood lowering your blood pressure  the antibodies were giving you should neutralize the colchicine  allowing your heart to beat at its normal rate  when will you know  we know now  thank god   mmm    big weekend its not for me im fully stocked   cuddy got you doing inventory  nope trying to solve that kids case  the gout medicine od yeah  the fact that i know its a gout medicine od would indicate the case is already solved  well youd be wrong  what about the fact that the kid is now i believe the technical term is not sick  you know how many forms of colchicine there are on the market   stop it  neither do i but its a lot  pills powders liquids i v fluids  somewhere at a party in his coffee up his nose in his ear this kid had some  youre not happy with your ecstasy theory   he said he used it twice  people lie   if youre gonna lie its  you know what im not interested   not curious  no because im welladjusted  right  temperatures normal i want cousin sharon there  if we invite sharon we have to invite all the cousins  so what my side of the family doesnt need anything     i dont suppose i could have some of those cough pills huh theyre okay right   yes youre doing great  you should invite dr house    will he come  no but hell send a gift   ill make sure its a good one  theres a letter on the back of these pills  your old pills didnt have a letter on them  no round and yellow but no letter  well these will help your cough  hey you wanna go get some no  thats some bad hat harry
