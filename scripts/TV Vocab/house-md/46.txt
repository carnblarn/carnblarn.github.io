                hes got a temperature of 103  and why do we care  because were human beings its what we do  he said he was at a luncheon meeting  you took his history  guy looks like harpo you should see him  you asked him what book hes currently reading  its hilarious to watch him try and talk  i asked him anything i could think of  favorite color  boo  favorite  dessert topping  trust me you never know what fact may prove the key to saving your life  whipped cream  i asked him if he was sure  where are you going  youre an ass  i know  where are you going  this is either a toxin an infection or an allergic reaction  i assume you gave him epi so that rules out allergies  put him on antibiotics in case its an infection  and if its a toxin well keep him here overnight  let the swelling go down send him home  im going to the movies  which one of you is house  the skinny brunette  no thats dr cameron  im skinny how do you know her name  i was a patient of yours  oh well if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs  stay  stay away from him  shocking isnt it  whod want to hurt you  youre pathetic  judging by the growth  id say ive been unconscious for two days  have you been sitting there the whole time  no  judging by the oily buildup in your hair  id say youre lying  i was scared  pardon me for caring  did i lose any organs  the bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach  nicked the bowel lodged in the posterior rib  well i always say if youre gonna get shot  do it in a hospital  the one in your neck  i dont remember that one  went right through severed your jugular  the shooter turns out to be a guy  dont care  you dont care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor  shot you  i assume his reasoning was faulty  so what was it  infection  the surgery went fine  youve had no postop  not me patient  harpo  you just got shot house you should rest  i got shot diagnostically boring  big fat tongue on the other hand endlessly entertaining  we biopsied his tongue  and it was negative  and the blood tests were negative  i didnt say we did blood tests  you dont biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue  and you dont have to biopsy a tongue  unless youve already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests  which dont involve torturing your patient  any new symptoms  other than the increased intracranial pressure  any guesses on how i figured that one out  you knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture  a lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer  since we dont have a definitive answer  we must not have done an lp  and the most common reason to not do an lp  is increased intracranial pressure  he was shot by security trying to  house what are you  house  im talking to cuddy  lie down  youve got to be in pain  not today  today im on morphine  youre going to rip your stitches out  check harpos trash  forget about the patient  come on  youre curious  trash  you dont know what im talking about  but you know its good  you cant just be walking around  well then stop me  youve lost blood  physically stop me   you could damage  you cant  because that would involve physically touching me  and then things would t so sexually charged  im twice your size  get your hands off me  everything that lives eats  everything that eats poops  thats why every organ has a sanitation department  the lymph system  whatevers doing the damage is dumping its waste in there  thats what you meant by trash  biopsy the lymph node under the jaw  im sorry i know its crazy but theres no other place  its the icu  it stands for intensive care  he needs intensive care so do you  he needs to be shot again  he is handcuffed to his bed  he is sedated  hes not going to hurt you  if your security was any good  i wouldnt have been shot in the first place  he is where hes supposed to be  where youre supposed to be  who did my surgery  gillick why  you going to send him a fruit basket  he screwed up  its annoying enough dealing with your vicodin habit  quit upping your morphine  im not  im reducing it  and youre not in pain  im feeling better  gillick is very good  your recovery time  my stomach kills me  my neck is throbbing  but my leg feels better  thats amazing  its unbelievable  since getting shot is not an fda approved treatment for anything  it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery  yes terriblytragically wrong  enjoy the mistake  he must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system  if its alleviating pain who knows what else its doing  get back to the icu  before you rip out your stitches  and i have to chain you to your bed  why did you try to kill me  i didnt  then the gun thing might have been a mistake  if id have killed you it would have been over  i needed you to live  because i want to see you suffer  get the needle out of there  he cant breathe  house  the test was negative  are you sure you want to be doing this  im fine  i think  cameron you got my records  they dont like to release patients operative notes  and yet youre holding them  and whispering  hes sleeping  yeah  killer needs his rest  otherwise hes grumpy all day  hey wake up  watch me save a life  almost for sure its some sort of infection  weve got him on broad spectrum antibiotics  but its not even slowing the thing down  unless we figure out what type of infection  we cant treat  and we cant figure out what type  because we cant do an lp  do an lp  see what i did there  couldnt have done that if youd killed me  we would have done an lp two days ago if we could have  but that much pressure  somethings bound to go  we would have done an lp two days ago  if the risks hadnt so obviously outweighed the benefits  we just cut a hole in his throat  the equation has changed  couldnt have put it better myself  pressure   with small visible excursions related to respiration and pulse  well within normal thats good  no thats weird  you want to hear a story  i have a rule  people who shoot me forfeit the right  my wife was sick  none of the doctors could figure out why  oh i know this story  she died  so you selected one of her doctors to kill  because that would make everything right again  she lived  you cured her  im truly sorry i did that  in the course of investigating her illness  you convinced me that everything was relevant  you needed the truth  i confessed to you that id had an affair  but it turns out that it had nothing to do with why she was sick  genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms  you told her that  you also told her about my affair  and you caught crap  she left you  and now ive got to pay  because you couldnt keep your little killer in your pants  she killed herself  what sort of hospital has glass walls  thats my husband  really  you thought i just liked watching people get needles poked in the back  nope  i figured a coworker or a sister  not wife  why  dont worry its not insulting  at least not to you  youre satisfied by that answer  youre dr house arent you  youre not going to shoot me are you  you treated a friend of mine  she told me you only talk to people if you have to  and then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are  sevens marry sevens  nines marry nines  fours marry fours  maybe theres some wiggle room if theres enough money  or somebody got pregnant  but youve got at least three points on your husband  and your frock says you didnt do it for the money  and your breasts say that you havent had any kids  so you figure my marriage is a mathematical error  numbers dont lie  were having trouble finding out what infection your husband has  the most likely culprit is an std  you want to know if ive had an affair with someone closer to my integer  and i have to tell you the truth or my husband will die  is your friend single  no  and ive always been faithful  wow  i wouldve bet money something would go wrong  lets rotate him back  hes bleeding into his ocular orbit  lp wouldnt do this  lots of pressure behind  gotta relieve it  whats going on what what are they doing  i should go  i seem to have torn my stitches  you collapsed in the hall  tore your stitches  i remember i was there  hows your gut its hurting  you shoot the guy who sold her the gun  she locked herself in the garage  and she started the car  you shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener  youre an ass  that is a bold position to take given that i shot you  the shooting just makes you an idiot  youre an ass because youre trying to wrap it in the flag  like you did a good thing  youre an ass and a hypocrite  you dont believe in rules  you do whatever you think is right  thats all i did  you were my role model  watch out youre getting crumbs on the flag  i didnt commit to honor her  i didnt commit to never lie to her  well if youd kept your mouth shut  shed be alive and you wouldnt be shot  if youd kept your pistols in your pants  its my fault shes dead  i know it  but why cant you admit  that its maybe just a little bit yours too  that maybe its not just medical mistakes that screw things up  heres how life works  you either get to ask for an apology  or you get to shoot people  not both  infections dont make your eyes pop out  we should get back  youre supposed to be chained to your bed  im not done eating  theres got to be some sort of bleeding disorder  this is really stupid  look if my stitches pop out again  i got three doctors to save me  could be some sort of weakness in the lining of the ocular veins  okay ill be you guys  no way mate  too much blood to just be a vein  no way hizzie  if it was an artery hed still be bleeding  actually hed be dead  he could have had a granuloma in his sinuses that bled  which could have been caused by wegeners  i think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth while they were sticking the eyeball back in  tongue and eyes are sick  what about the nose  its right in between why isnt it sick  so its not spreading its got a common source  which can only be what  the brain except the ct was clean  check the brains trash see what its hiding  the brain doesnt have a lymph system  i know  all its garbage just blows off  gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road  youre referring to the bloodbrain barrier  what else  biopsy the barrier  wouldnt it be safer to make a few educated guesses first  try some relatively safe treatments  biopsy the barrier  but first start him on mebendazole in case its a worm  and levofloxacin in case its an infection that slipped by the first antibiotic  and azithromycin for stds  i really dont think the wife is the kind to be messing around  if i was married to her i certainly wouldnt  house  the patient isnt married hes a widower  really its more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself  my body is fine  my mind on the other hand  maybe she was a girlfriend  maybe she was just trying to jerk you around  i spoke to every one of the nurses on that floor  the patient had only had six visitors  two females no babes  his mother and his aunt  so they missed someone  theyre not security  my posse never saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass  they were a little busy trying to save the guys life  theres on one possible conclusion  it was a hallucination  what does that look like to you  pointsix  anesthesia  no  its got to be six and a smudge  lets say you eight  it wouldnt be that uncommon after trauma  after that much blood loss  if my perceptions are compromised  then my judgment is compromised  what if his wife told me  that the patient just got bit by a rabid vietnamese leper  so pull yourself off the case  and the next case  you take two weeks  you recover  what if i dont  what if it wasnt the shooting  the guy who sees connections between everything  sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruptions  what if it was the surgery  what if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood  why did gillick give me ketamine during my surgery  working  we need to talk  get back to the icu who uncuffed you  why would a surgeon administer ketamine  who showed you your surgical file  how do you know its mine  because your patient hasnt had surgery  and you dont care about anybody else  my anesthesia was almost nonexistent  and yet i wasnt awake  for some reason  somebody decided to put me in a dissociative coma  instead of just putting me out  there are plenty of reasons to use  fine  ill go beat the truth out of my surgeon  gillick right  it worked  theres a clinic in germany  theyve been treating chronic pain by inducing comas  and letting the mind basically reboot itself  theres about a 50 chance your pain will come back  which of course means there is a 50 chance that it wont  you had no right  to heal you  you messed with my brain  why are you so upset  are you experiencing any neurological symptoms  dizziness tremors hallucinations  no  its a point of principle  test was negative  no trash against the fence  is your leg really better  dont worry im sure something else is wrong  we did find blood  on which side  the wrong side  first thing that makes sense  the wrong sides the wrong side  it cant make sense  itd mess with his brain  wouldnt cause fever  hes been sleeping a lot lately  you worried  i marked a change of meds on his chart  foreign object  body wants to get rid of it  it causes the fever  bloods a foreign object  in the brain lining it is  blood dyscrasia means cancer  find it  all the tests  have been negative  what do you do if your trash cans are full  you use your neighbors trash cans  except its still light outside  your neighbor will see you  so you go out the back way into an alley  and drop off your trash by their garage  well check the lymphatic system in the chest  you got that from trash cans in the alley  the saliva glands from the tongue  are connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs  its the next lymphatic system over  yeah  go get lung lymph  how did he know that  i wouldnt have hired him if he wasnt smart  right  because you have nothing but respect for him  maybe he knew the answer  because the question  wasnt nearly as tricky as you thought  maybe hes not getting smarter  youre getting dumber  you pretend to buck the system  pretend to be a rebel  you claim to hate rules  but all you do is substitute your own rules for societys  and its a nice simple rule  tell the blunt honest truth  in the starkest darkest way  and what will be will be  what will be should be  and everyone else is a coward  but youre wrong  its not cowardly to not call someone an idiot  people arent tactful or polite just because its nice  they do it because theyve got an ounce of humility  because they know that they will make mistakes  and they know that their actions have consequences  and they know that those consequences are their fault  why do you want so bad not to be human house  oh hes awake  house we need to talk to you  how the hell did you know i was awake  your nostrils flare when you sleep  no they do not  fine im lying  test was negative  you knew  force of habit  showed no cancer  no reason why hes got a fever of 103  and no reason why his tongue wont fit in his mouth  hes postop chase is getting him up and around  its important that youre up asap after surgery  you think you can urinate  its getting bigger  what youre  getting aroused  no not that part  oh god it hurts  its not stopping  surgeons found no evidence of a burst artery  the blood had to come from somewhere  you took a shower in it  trauma  you think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels  and poke out his eye and swell up his tongue  keep riding  i got a bet with my physio that i can do 100 klicks by friday  what about blood from the kidneys  kidneys drain into the bladder which drains into the ureter  theres no way it would mess with the scrotum  yeah  basic human anatomy  therefore i think its safe to assume that the problem lies elsewhere  but given that this case doesnt make any kind of sense whatsoever  maybe we should even question the basics  maybe hes not human  an anatomical defect would seem more likely but lets not rule that one out  even more likely he is human  his anatomy is where its supposed to be but he has testicular cancer  we tested for cancer  we tested the lymph system in his chest  surgeons found no growth  surgeons were just trying to put everything back where it was  they werent doing an inventory  may have been lucky  if you dont catch testicular cancer early it kills  probably eroded some vessel  yeah i know  the question is why i didnt think of it  eyes popping out is a rather odd presentation  sack blowing up on the other hand  if you could think of everything yourself you wouldnt need a team to annoy  i screwed up some basic anatomy  and i missed connecting a testicular explosion with a testicular problem  you think theres any way i would have done that before cuddy messed with my brain  she was trying to help you and it worked  yeah i can run like the wind  but i cant think  and seeing as how im too old to become a professional athlete  it looks to me as if she screwed me over big time  you dont want a healthy leg  oh here we go  if youve got a good life if youre healthy  youve got no reason to bitch no reason to hate life  heres the flaw in your argument  if i enjoy hating life i dont hate life i enjoy it  i didnt say it was rational  hiv testing is 99 accurate  which means there are some people who test positive  who live with their own impending doom for months  or years before finding out everythings okay  weirdly most of them dont react with happiness or even anger  they get depressed  not because they wanted to die  but because theyve defined themselves by their disease  suddenly what made them them isnt real  i dont define myself by my leg  no you have taken it one step further  the only way you could come to terms with your disability  was to somehow make it mean nothing  so you had to redefine everything  you have dismissed anything physical  anything not coldly calculatingly intellectual  why are you protecting her  because shes done nothing wrong  youre completely comfortable with what she did to me  yeah i am yeah  you agonize over moral choices  youre not completely comfortable with anything  until youve taken days to get your head around every possible side  ive known what she did for six hours  how come youre acting like youve known for days  what do i have  youre not sick  what do i have  you need to calm down  i have my brain and thats it  we were trying to help you  yeah nobody tries to screw up they just do  you were out of control you were shooting morphine  i can make people better  and you two decide to trade that for jogging shoots  if youre suffering from side effects then we can look at that  you value the physical so much  let me put this in terms you can understand  youre unbelievable  even when youre out of your mind with anger and fear  you still couch it in logical terms  are you hallucinating  yeah im hallucinating  no i mean right now  are you hallucinating  how did you know i was  you were yelling at me  you were calling me wilson  no  youre losing it house  i never call wilson by his name  oh yeah right  the hallucinator is going to tell the hallucinatee what happened  youre not the hallucinatee wilson was the hallucinatee  you think maybe youre focusing on the wrong thing here  cuddys office was the hallucinatee  the bathroom was the hallucinatee  bathroom it figures  what figures  you wet your bed  damn it  test was negative  no  afp and beta hcg say no testicular cancer  so lets recap weve just ruled out everything  which doesnt make sense  so the answer has to be something that doesnt make sense  do a cystoscopy make sure hes human  test was negative  for him being human  everything was right where its supposed to be  all the tubes go where theyre supposed to go  most likely scenario is some kind of bacterial prostatitis  find out if his father hunche  his father have trouble peeing  his father have sex with his own mother  if the answers to any of these questions is yes assume youre right  if the answers are no  assume youre right but biopsy some prostate lymphs just to be sure  but  then wed have to cut through his stomach  and since hes clearly got a bleeding problem this kind of surgery might  he doesnt clearly have anything  how did i get here  what are you talking about  i was in the icu  and then i was coming down these stairs with you guys  what happened in between  i dont remember how i got here  im taking myself off my case  your patients in critical care hes had a fever unabated for two  im losing my mind  im having blackouts  you said you werent having any  i lied  if you are doing this to scare me you made your point  next time you get shot i promise to only treat the bullet wounds  im off the case  why did you jump up when i came in  i thought you were going to attack me again  again  yeah you were in my face  you were  no i wasnt  you came in here with wilson and  that was a hallucination  no you  which means this is a hallucination  how can i tell whats real and whats not  everything looks the same  sounds the same  tastes the same  seems like id be the last person youd want to ask  why not  youre obviously not here  im obviously not here  which means this is a creation of my mind  which means im really just asking myself  well if youre talking to yourself thats a lot of unnecessary explanation  hey im trying to work this out  that requires give and take even in my own mind  what was the question  how can i tell whats real  does it matter  that doesnt sound like something id ask  all right  your concern is at if you act in the real world based on information thats not real  the results are impossible to foresee  with you so far  but information is incapable of harm in and of itself  ideas are neither good nor bad  but merely as useful as what we do with them  only actions can cause harm  that sounds like me  so you do nothing  you refrain from taking any actions  continue to throw out your ideas as you always would  but if theyre based on faulty assumptions  your team will point that out  they wont do anything that could hurt him  so i trust my team  test was negative  no blood in the prostate  no structural abnormalities  if something doesnt make sense  what does that mean  its not rhetorical  i need your input on everything i ask no matter how obvious it might seem  it means youre wrong  it means one of your assumptions is wrong  because if something doesnt make sense it cant be real  so what are our assumptions  we dont have any were just guessing on testing  we assume the tests are right  weve already redone them  twice lets go more basic  whats more basic than the test results  the tests themselves  what does a biopsy consist of  you take a sample  define sample  its a small representative piece of whatever you think is the problem  you go down to the shore you fill a cup of water  its got no fish in it  does that mean no fish in the ocean  we can do another biopsy  we could fill another cup of water we gotta dive in  we gotta see whats actually in there  we cant operate hes got a bleeding problem  we assume hes got a bleeding problem  yeah because he bled from where he wasnt supposed to bleed  causing parts of his body to blow up  assuming that crazy assumption is correct  if we operate on him well kill him  what if we could find a way to do this surgery  without giving him more than a paper cut  you want to let a robot operate on me  the technology is amazing  it magnifies everything ten times its ten times the accuracy  no way i want a person  a person will be controlling  people suck  people have turned you from a guy with a swollen tongue  into a guy with one eye one ball and a stapledon face  if you want someone to hold you while you cry yourself to sleep at night  choose warm and soft  if you want someone to write you a poem  pick the sensitive loner  but if all you care about is that somethings done right  pick the guy with the metal head  no way  no way no way  you gotta see this thing in action before you say no way come on  house what are you doing  nothing  im not doing anything  just throwing out ideas  i think you should put him in a wheelchair take him down to the o r  but i may be out of my mind  relax cameron  im not going to cut you  i just want to show what this puppy can do  it can make onemillimeter incisions  you know how small that is  its small even in metric  if i do something that doesnt make sense  even to you stop me  delicate no  house  does that hurt  seen enough  no  that wasnt a question  you either do this or you die  youve wasted your life  yeah  if only id spent more time dedicating myself to finding someone worthy to shoot  if i had killed you would it have mattered  not to me  have you got a pen  you dont care if you live or die  i care because i live  i cant care if im dead  i dont want to hear semantics  you antisemantic bastard  would anybody care that the world lost that wit  working here  thats all right you dont have to say anything  just let me soak into your subconscious  you think that the only truth that matters  is the truth that can be measured  good intentions dont count  whats in your heart doesnt count  caring doesnt count  but a mans life can be measured  by how many tears are shed when he dies  just because you cant measure them  just because you dont want to measure them  doesnt mean its not real  that does not make sense  and even if im wrong  youre still miserable  did you really think that your lifes purpose  was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return  no  you believe theres no purpose to anything  even the lives you save you dismiss  you turn the one decent thing in your life and you taint it strip it of all meaning  youre miserable for nothing  i dont know why youd want to live  im sorry  i know whats wrong  house get out of here youre not sterile  hell be fine  great  whats he got  how come you guys have never tried to yank me off this case  im having hallucinations  blackouts  but youre always insane and youre always right  im almost always eventually right  you have no way of knowing when eventually is  every time ive had an epiphany on this one  you guys were right on board  no challenges no need to explain  no offense but  either you guys are getting smarter or im getting dumber  weve worked with you long enough to know  i know the test results even before you enter the room  we have identical knowledge  how is that possible  youre wrong  if something doesnt make sense  one of your assumptions has to be wrong  because if something doesnt make sense it cant be real  but what if the faulty assumption is that its real  house youre losing it  ive lost it  why did you stop me  because i think youre going to kill him  no you dont think that  you know it  because youre in my head  as long as the delusion makes sense my mind lets it go on  i have to make it not make sense i have to  push it past the point where it can trick my mind  hey hey  if this is a nightmare youre gonna wake up  if its real youre killing a man  its also possible that i may already be dead  but i dont believe in the after life  house go back to your room  if this is a hallucination its a good one  youre pain free you can walk  its not real therefore its meaningless  i want meaning  oh god  goodbye   he was shot  twice  once in the abdomen once in the neck  hello its going to be okay  youre gonna be okay  you dont know nothing  tell cuddy  i want ketamine
