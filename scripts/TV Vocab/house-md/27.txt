8nov2005  wilson patient experiences shocklike sensations  as well as headaches nausea and drowsiness  chase shocks  excruciatingly painful shocks  er docs referred him to a neurologist who referred him to five other doctors in the last seven days  shocks could be lhermittes sign early symptom of ms  no mri showed no white matter lesions and  the shocks arent accompanied by neck flexing  good morning  its almost noon  really that must be why im so hungry  whos up for lunch  whats with the jacket  it keeps me warm and cool how does it know  wilson were discussing your new patient  it must be a boring discussion seeing as i havent accepted a new patient  you accepted him the moment i loaned you five grand  oh wait wait  when i said id do anything for the money obviously i didnt mean it  youre gonna like this the kids getting shocked every few minutes  cameron why would you need 5000  bad night at poker or a great night with a hooker  thank you for saving me the trouble of deflecting that personal question with a joke  college student  nitrous oxides fun at parties  can cause the shocks and drinking till you puke every night can cause everything else  give him some b12  been there done that also ruled out cancer ms pyridoxine toxicity  and all the popular neuropathies   cervical spondylosis  doesnt explain the low white count  hes black  im assuming hes not just really dirty but is of african descent  which means hed have a lower white count   not this low  hes a wrestler  probably uses diuretics to cut weight  it can also cause low white count   not this low  not this low   behcets  no skin lesions   cervical herpes roster myelitis  no external outbreak  somethings missing  find out what it is  uh i dont even know what that means  well figure it out find it out and then find me ill be at lunch  carnell no ideas  cameron lots of ideas  too many ideas thats why so many tests  have you used any recreational drugs  what  im gonna get mad at you for getting stoned  not today not here  um at christmas one of the guys had some ecstasy i mean  it wasah  ah  son of a bitch ow  ana is negative for lupusagain  house wants more information not the same information done over again  find whats missing  for all we know the kid is dying and hes giving us riddles  did a more detailed history went back three generations   and  his mom died in a car accident  his moms mom had arthritis his moms moms dad served in an allblack tank battalion under patton  fascinating  if its not a tumor it has to be ms  wilson already ruled out  mri cant rule out ms  ms doesnt explain a low white count  alcoholism does  on admission his bac was 20 liver enzymes off the chart  it was graduation weekend  he barely drank in the weeks before that  and he didnt drink at all during his wrestling season   if you believe him  i did a tox screen  it doesnt matter if she believes him or not its already in the chart  were supposed to find out whats missing  well this this is perfect  invite me to dinner thursday night  come on we havent had a nice meal together since oh  yesterday when i loaned you 5000 to buy a new car  my treat  twowheeled vehicles that travel 150 miles an hour  dont really go well with crippled irresponsible drug addicts  actually twowheeled vehicles that go 180 miles an hour  do not go well with healthy responsible architects  who dont know how to separate braking and turning  the good news is it brings the price right down  youre taking it back  mom  how bout we talk about this over dinner  forget dinner youre gonna kill yourself  chase nice bike  thank you see thats how you do it  compliments dinner  what do you with your cane  he buys me dinner hell find out  evel knievel had the same set up  and he broke every bone in his body  we went through all the imaging studies and redid the blood cultures and   i dont want handmedowns  i want brand new stuff  theres nothing   theres nothing missing  sorry i didnt catch that last part  theres n   theres n   theres nothing else we can do   you check the police report  on what   on his moms car accident  it was 15 years ago  the kid wasnt even in the car  she veered off a straight dry road in broad daylight that doesnt seem odd  to you  she probably got distracted changing radio stations or something  thats what the police thought  of course they didnt know that she has a family member who is frequently incapacitated by shocklike sensations  a genetic component seems unlikely  but its interesting  a type two neurofibromatosis could cause the shock  you knew this was missing  i knew something was missing maybe this maybe something else  get a dna analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22      youd rather have dinner with your wife  yes i would  if she were speaking to me  unlike her i could make it worth your while  fine  should i drive  ah no  and im not letting you in my car until i see your wallet  nf2 its an inherited disease  it could cause abnormal growths on the cranial nerves  it would explain the shocks and other symptoms  dna analysis will show whether your son has the specific chromosome mutation which causes the disease  but if its inherited that means someone else in our family would have it  we think your wife may have had it  no she never had any sort of health problems  no oddlooking freckles nodules in the iris  nothing i mean why would you think she was sick  we think it may have been what caused her car accident  wait what do you mean my moms car was hit by a drunk driver  thats not what the police report indicated  well you must have gotten the wrong report  no  they didnt   when you started driving  i um  you lied about how mom died  i figured if her death could somehow mean something  hows lying about it mean something  carnell how could you use her like that dad  her death  i was just trying to protect you  what else isnt true  carnell she wasnt a teacher you just wanted me to read  whats that smell  i dont smell  were gonna need a nurse   what the hell  its okay  well take care of it  you didnt feel anything  no   you feel that  yeah  but you didnt feel any of this  no  sphincter paralysis plus shocks equals miller fisher syndrome  not if you add the stool sample which is negative for cjejuni  he lied to his son about how his mom died  cameron he was just protecting him  manipulating him  thats what parents do  they lie to us because they love us  whos getting teary  moms death is irrelevant  dna revealed no nf2 markers or any other inherited disease  apparently she really did fall asleep at the wheel  so what exactly are we talking about here  a little peeker or did the prairie dog actually come out to play  excuse me  we talking explosive  the hemoccult was negative for blood   and i wouldnt say he actually exploded more like gushed  good  were getting somewhere  yeah where   i have no idea  of course  love the riddles   hello hi mom  look i have a business dinner on thursday night i cant get out of  i know i really wanted to see you too  actually can i call you back im in a meeting right now  okay thanks  cameron who was that  angelina jolie  i call her mom  who thinks thats sexy  so explosive or gushing  she never calls here is everything okay  great yeah  my dads taking her to europe  they got a ninehour layover in newark on thursday  if its gastrointestinal  you lied to avoid seeing your own mom  are you kidding  i cant lie to my mom  seriously i cant  wilsons invited me to dinner  it would be rude to stand up a guy who just loaned me five grand  transverse myelitis  it causes numbness anal sphincter dysfunction  and the shocks  thank you for taking no interest in my mother  that begs the question what caused the transverse myelitis  weve ruled out cancer and ms  leaves infection  if there was infection thered be a fever  and his blood and csf cultures are already negative  maybe the infections gone but the memory remains  molecular mimicry  nice  okay get an immunoglobulin level and electrophoresis  youre good my friend  im sure well meet again  you really think that was his mom on the phone  probably i dont know why hed lie about that  who cares  youre not the least bit curious what his parents are like  im sure his moms a piece of work  only a mother could do that much damage  my bets he was born the way he is  probably tormented his parents not the other way around  he was either a fast runner or one hell of a fighter  where you going  you guys handling the test right  is there something important that you and house need to discuss over dinner  other than the skyrocketing interest rates on personal loans  you know this is the fourth time ive loaned him money  not lunch money money money  houses parents  they have a layover in newark thursday evening   im canceling dinner  no i thought maybe you could just invite a few more people  foreman an infectious agents molecular structure can resemble the spinal cords  when the immune system attacks infection ends up attacking spinal cords as well  so he has an infection  they just said i dont  even after the infection is gone it goes right on attacking because the spinal cord is still there  is there a treatment  depends on what the original infection was  all right youre done  you need to lay flat after a lumbar puncture for about an hour  i feel like im gonna throw up  hey dad can you get me a coke please  yeah that usually helps  youre done  if youre nauseous  no im not nauseous i just want him outta here  hes your dad hes gonna be around  yeah i know  its not that its  are these people completely incapable of telling the truth to each other  he went to jamaica with his friends   no wonder he lied  children arent supposed to have good times  one of his friends flew them down  carnells dad has this thing about him accepting stuff from rich friends  wants him to remember who he is and where he came from  where have you been  making dinner plans  whats up  the boys have uncovered the shocking fact that the patient has a crappy relationship with his dad  they seem to actually care  well i dont theres only one reason any kid with a plane flies to jamaica  it wasnt for marijuana  he doesnt do anything but drink  he said that to you or his pops  tox screen was negative for thc  spring break was over a month ago  even pot would have washed out by now  even if hed smoked no way marijuana causes transverse myelitis  true but the stuff that they put on it does  pesticides  why would he come clean about the trip but lie about smoking pot  he wouldnt necessarily have to smoke to get pesticide poisoning  he could have eaten fruit that had been sprayed or been exposed through his skin on a hike  or he could have smoked it  a lot of it  and lied about it because thats what this family does  start him on iv pralidoxime  two grams per liter then one gram every eight hours until you see some improvement  you have no evidence to support a poisoning diagnosis  which is why its gonna be so cool when i turn out to be right  cameron  who are you making dinner plans with  no one  house you bastard  you invited my parents to dinner  jeez camerons got a big mouth  ha not as big as yours  hey you used me to avoid seeing your parents  what do you care  i dont i just thought it might be interesting to find out why  you could have just asked  you would have lied  and you would have believed me which would have kept us both happy  you want your money back is that what this is about  no  waitwell  have you got the money  if you have the money then why did you need the loan  i didnt  i just wanted to see if youd give it to me  ive been borrowing increasing amounts ever since you lent me 40 a year ago  a little experiment to see where you draw the line  youreyoure trying to objectively measure how much i value our friendship  its five grand  you got nothing to be ashamed of  so what do you say  one little phone call one big check  fine  thanks  now be a grownup and either tell mommy and daddy you dont want to see them  or im picking you up at 700 for dinner  what do you mean   you just said that  i lied  ive been lying to you in increasing amounts ever since i told you you looked good unshaved a year ago  its a little experiment you know see where you draw the line  cuddy hows the patient  havent been in yet today  as long as he hasnt gotten any worse  youre treating him for pesticide poisoning without any proof of pesticides  were gonna have a hell of a time explaining that to our lawyer  i told house not to  wow  lawyers not gonna believe this  ha ha ha hes got his appetite back  whatever you did its working  he is healthy swallow is forgiven  now im feeling nauseous  he is not healthy  nausea and diarrhea were not his only symptoms   shocks have also decreased  but not disappeared  and hes out of the diaper which is good news for everyone  what about his low white count  the little buggers need time to grow  dont worry our wrestling rastafarian will be back on his feet  and sneaking around behind pops back again in no time   yeah  check it again  ill be right there  what happened  apparently i can save money by switching to another longdistance carrier  oh i was right wasnt i  oh yeah its always about you isnt it  cameron he has the chills and his temperature is spiking  its nearly 106  whats that mean i mean whats happened  you want the truth do you want me to make something up to protect you  we think a drunk driver broke into his room  whats happening to my son  the truth is i have no idea  theres the fever that cameron was looking for  we knew if it was myelitis there had to be an itis  this must be the infection that set it off  yeah except in this universe effect follows cause  ive complained about it but   maybe the tests were wrong  no the tests were right  yesterday he had no fever no infection  so he just happened to catch a bug while he was here thats all this is  yeah because his white blood cell count was down he was vulnerable  because its really down it might kill him but thats all this is  is he still pooping his pants  he just started again  again  it stopped when he was getting better  he was feeling better  he was never getting better  so all we have to answer is what causes a 22yearold kid  to become immunocompromised with gi involvement and shocks  that stop and start for no apparent reason  we need to find an answer before this infection kills him  yeah thatd be the ideal  you intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics  you get a cervical thoracic and lumbar t2 weighted fast spin echo mris  and you track down all those richie riches who went to jamaica  see if any of them got the shocks the trots or the hots  the hots its fever    you guys gonna join us for dinner thursday  um gotta do my laundry  youre not curious  curious about crocs but i dont stick my head in their mouths  im out too  house is a freak  theres no virus that causes that no dna mutation  youre gonna have one dinner with two people  most of it spent chewing talking about the weather  unless they something like  do you prefer the chardonnay or the merlotwe kept greg locked in the closet for 17 years  youre not gonna learn anything  cameron okay  wed like to talk to some of your friends see if they have any similar symptoms  the doctors in the er already asked me that  cameron we understand  but they didnt have all the information that we have now  what kind of information  would you mind if i spoke with carnell alone for a minute   is this bad news  no  its just confidential  why is something suddenly confidential  i mean if you know something about my son i need to know whats going on  im sorry i have to insist  im his father  and if im going to take care of him i need to know the truth  dad  she wants to know who i went to jamaica with  you never been to jamaica  taddys dad flew a bunch of us down over spring break  you told me you had two papers to write over the break  cause i didnt wanna come home and work my ass off  i wanted to take an actual break during the break for once  i shouldnt have lied to you  no what you shoulda done is come home instead of partying with your rich friends  im sorry we need those names  cuddy what do you want  to apologize  i realize that my attention to the clinic has been somewhat lax of late and i want to make amends  how bout tomorrow night i take the night shift  the clinics closed at night  yeah but im sure theres plenty of things to be done  theres charts to be reviewed supplies inventoried  dinners avoided   youre going too  i love their cobb salad   give me a reason to get out of this  and ill tell you who started the rumor about you being a transsexual  there is no such rumor  there will be unless you get me out of this dinner  no ones making you do this house  just do what everybody else does lie to them   you lie to your mother  only since i was 12  my moms a human polygraph  my dad should be taking her to vegas not the louvre  trust me your mom would much rather think you have a business meeting than you hate her  i dont hate her  i hate him  taddy we all had headaches nausea vomiting  you know we figured it was connected to the massive amounts of drinking  or you think what happened to carnell has something to do with the trip  dont know  you havent had any unexplained pain or strange feelings since you got back  nope except for a little athletes foot im fine  can i see it   see what  your feet  theres a common parasite in jamaica that can resemble foot fungus  its not really my feet  you know i figured fungus is fungus  its my groin  im going to need to take a look at that  now  unless you wanna come down to the hospital with me  no i cant i mean i just started two days ago   and were right in the middle of a big merg then drop your pants   reilly i need the  what the hells going on here  shes a doctor  im a doctor he has a rash   and a friend of his  right  well as soon as shes done treating your rash  i need the numbers on dport technology  yes sir  and doctor why dont you leave a card on your way out  except for one guy with a rash no one else on the trip has any health issues  what kind of rash  i dont know i took some scrapings it doesnt appear to be ringworm  what did it look like aside from not ringworm  basically like diaper rash  hes been working around the clock  said he hasnt changed his clothes in three days  kaposis sarcoma can look like diaper rash  any discoloration around the edges  get him in here we all wanna take a look  even if it is kaposis its not related  the patient doesnt have any skin symptoms and  weve already ruled out cancer  what are the odds of two friends whove just returned from a trip outside the country  coming down with unexplained but unrelated illnesses get him in here  he wont come just started a new job after graduation  theyre working on some big merger  tell him his friends life hangs in the balance  thats what i told him the first time  still wound up driving into manhattan  tell him his life hangs in the balance  tell him the rash is flesheating  and the next course on the menu is his frank and beans  where is stacy  uh speaking at a conference in baltimore  why what do you need  can i subpoena a patient  house wants me to lie to the kid to get him in here  well then youll be the one getting the subpoena  well we do need him to diagnose his friend  take the test to the kid  there is no test house just wants to look at it  then take house to it  yeah like thats gonna happen  tell house his parents called  said they were coming in early  hell go anywhere just to avoid them  so its okay to lie to house but not to a patient  yep    ahh  whats wrong  his stomachs getting a lot worse  ahh  hes rigid   ahh  hes bleeding into his abdomen   ahh  cameron whats going on   we need a surgeon and an or stat  on it  ah  try to hang in there carnell  ahh  infection caused a perforation in his sigmoid colon  its repairable  it means the antibiotics arent working  double the dose and add tygacil to the list  as soon as hes out of surgery  wheres richie rich  he said he cant leave work  yeah you told me that two hours ago  im not gonna lie  why because its wrong  or because youre a coward  hmm tough choice  youd be wasting two hours of the kids time  is that deeply and unforgivably morally wrong no  because its not a waste of his time  unless were wrong  unless his conditions got nothing to do with his friends  youre just afraid of being wrong  your parents called   they had to catch an earlier  you dont have to lie to him  kids on his way here   he got off work  yeah by vomitting blood  ambulance is ten minutes out   you taddy  what  i love the name i never had a dog  take off his pants  taddy hey  dont talk to her listen to me  hes vomited in excess of three units of blood he needs to be admitted before  if you wanted to be a doctor maybe you should have buckled down a little more in high school  bite me   what are you doing  exactly how close were you and carnell  not so close  spend a lot of time together in jamaica share a room  wait you dont think look were not gay  im not saying youre gay im saying you had sex  look were not gay we hardly even hung out  right you flew him down to jamaica because he won a contest  no hes in my frat  between school and wrestling and going home every break to work at his fathers junkyard  carnell didnt have any time to hang out with anybody  house its not fungus  cameron i already told you that  theres no pustules its not staph  his dads what  his dad owns a scrap metal salvage yard  carnell worked there during breaks  you lied  what are you talking about  oh yeah of course in this family you probably need more specifics  you told us you owned a construction company not a salvage yard  i know the way things work  the better my job the better my son gets treated  right thats why im mad  we wasted all that filet mignon on you  did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you   no  braided wire  metal weights on each end a lead canister maybe just the lid  he probably used it as a doorstop or a paperweight  why would he wanna  okay here it comes  i gave him an early graduation gift an old plumb i found it looks like a fishing weight  i put it on a keychain so hed always remember where he came from  so he can lie about it later   wheres the keychain  i dont know  he never used it just kept it as a good luck charm   kept it where  i dont know  why  why does it matter  where are the kids clothes  in the bureau back in his regular room  you two get it to radiology  his clothes  the bureau dont open it  you come with me  set it down there  now get out of here this thing is radioactive  the chances of radiation causing cns symptoms  foreman wow    call the boys in the lead pajamas  radiation measurements werent high enough to cause central nervous system damage  it might not have caused nerve damage but it definitely destroyed his immune system  and caused tumors  we dont know that none of the mris showed anything  do a pet scan  check his cervical spine  its not gonna be good news  mr hall its not good news  the piece of metal you gave carnell was from an industrial device used to test wells  people arent supposed to just dump radioactive material  but they do  so what now i mean what do you do  anyone who has had contact with the source  will have to immediately get treatment for radiation sickness  taddy carried it on his lap on a flight  so there is a treatment  transfusions  and we try to get the fluids and the electrolytes balanced  carnellhes had much more exposure  the equivalent of about 70000 chest xrays  his ability to create white blood cells has been completely destroyed  thats why he cant fight off this infection  hes gonna need a bone marrow transplant    and we did we did another pet scan  theres a cavernous angioma within his spinal cord its a tumor  thats whats been causing the shocks and cns symptoms  he has a tumor inside of his spinal cord  the cord isis made of strands put together sort of like a kite string  the surgeon should be able to pull the strands apart and excise the tumor but  surgery on someone whos as hemopoetically compromised as your son isextremely risky  and uh  if you dont do the surgery i mean  the tumor could cause his breathing to stop  possibly his heart as well    theres no way you could have known    youre gonna have to come with us  you need to start treatment yourself  no no no no no no  i can start my treatment later  but he cant  he needs to be in a sterile isolation room to prevent further infections   mom  were early   its great to see you  oh greg dont lie  we came at a bad time didnt we  actually yeah i  i have to take a rain check  aw plans have been made  wilson made em  i asked him to cancel  im dealing with kind of a complicated case right now so  well well just come back when things arent so out of control  my team is busy  you dont wanna see us  mom dont make me feel guilty  no no of course not sorry  ive got a patient whos probably gonna die of radiation poisoning  so that means you cant eat  come on lets grab a bite in the cafeteria  ill buy you a reuben  i guess i got time for a sandwich  good  yeah  i just wanted to let you know carnells prepped for surgery  thank you  hi im allison cameron  i work with your son  gregs told us all about you  really   new huh  nope just gullible  im sorry i was just making fun of my son  not of you  we were just about to go to get something to eat would you care to join us  you dont have a lot of time with your son  cameron maybe another time  dr fedler do you like the beatles  theyre all right  my 12yearold just turned me back onto them  dr fedler mccartneys gotta have more money than god  dr fedler i think thats all of it reverse him  hows he doing  looks pretty good down here  do i rock or what   nurse his pressures dropping   give him another two units  i did already  his heart rates falling  chase hes hemorrhaging  theyre talking about moms last trip to the dentist  grown children talking to their parents nothing gets talked about  trust me youre not missing anything  so besides work what you been up to  not much  john you always say that not much  its always the answer  any new babes you might wanna tell me about  leave him alone john  i got a new motorcycle  you might have seen it out front its orange with a gigantic scrape  is it the one in the handicapped parking  yeah  looks like crap but it drives great  well youll be careful right  last i checked you still have two legs  actually three  you know what your problem is greg  shifting gears  you just dont know how lucky you are  wheres the head  good thing we got that cleared up  he was just trying to help  i dont need help  i know  youre absolutely perfect just the way you are  thank you  so how much longer do you think hell be in surgery  its hard to say  hmmhmm    you know he just started school when ann died  i was a mess hmm  still adjusting to being a parent much less a single parent  you know i used to put cold pancakes in his lunch box   i mean that was the only thing i could make that he would eat  you did okay hes a good kid  mr hall yah  hey so how is he  well the surgeon has removed the tumor without damaging the spinal cord  but the infection has caused another intestinal perforation  we stopped the bleeding but his white count keeps falling  okay um  so what now another drug antibiotics what  im sorry  the reality is no matter what we give him its  unlikely hes gonna be able to fight off the infections  okay okay  the father and the friend are responding well to treatment  things arent looking so good for carnell  thank you for not eating  it was none of my business  they seem perfectly pleasant dont they  they are  he was a marine pilot  she was a housewife  married 47 years  they had one child  my mom is just like everyone else  shes nice enough  great sense of humor hates confrontation  my dads just like you  not the caringtill youreyes popout part  just the insane moral compass that wont let you lie to anybody about anything  its a great quality for boy scouts and police witnesses  crappy quality for a dad  hey  how you doing  im hanging in there  im sorry i lied to you about mom  im sorry i lied to you too  there was nothing good that came out of her dying  im not mad  i know why you did it  it worked  i never drink and drive  im scared dad  come on  theres nothing to be scared of  youre gonna be just fine  dont play me  i wanna know the truth  im telling you the truth  youre gonna be fine  i swear  i love you dad  i love you too  why does he hate seeing his parents  so his dad tells the truth he cant handle that  he hates being a disappointment  hes a doctor world famous  how disappointed can they be  you know what i figure is worse than watching your son become crippled  watching him be miserable
