think i know that just send the damn ambulance  come on wake up come on sweetie   dr bender call extension 2870  you ever seen an infected pierced scrotum  um no but i know a few people on whom id like to see it happen we need to talk  well if pains what youre after the penis is really the way to go   id recommend the apadravya  were not talking  oh it sounded like we were  no youre attempting to avoid talking because you know what i wanna talk about  nipples you need to get rid of one of your people  absolutely as soon as i do performance reviews  and then review the reviews of course  a decision like this cant be made without proper you know review  shouldnt take longer than a month maybe two  four at the most unless it gets complicated  theres no way outta this  you might as well get it over with as fast as you can like ripping off a bandaid  only instead of a twocent piece of tape and gauze its a human being   like you care  like you dont  you have a week get it done  we have a referral from dr lenkiewicz   dont know him  he knows you   whats the problem  heart attack   definitely dont know him  the patients 10  tenyearolds do not have heart attacks its gotta be a mistake  right simplest explanation is shes a 40yearold lying about her age  maybe an actress trying to hang on i meant maybe the tests were wrong  thats what the er thought three ck mb s were positive  the ekg shows classic signs of s t elevation its a heart attack  shes morbidly obese the morbid part of that raises alarms  come on it takes decades to eat your way into a heart attack  doesnt take decades to kill yourself if i was that fat id be pretty tempted to knock back a bottle of pills  its not a drug overdose the fatigue muscle pain and difficulty concentrating have been bothering her for over a year  thats because of her weight her depression  thats what five pediatricians two nutritionists and a psychologist said  the heart attack would seem to indicate that they missed something   its gotta be something genetic  what about metabolic syndrome x   insulin resistance  syndrome x could cause a stroke i dont know about a heart attack   it could if her blood pressure was high enough  which is likely considering her weight  fits the symptoms me likee do a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp  oh and one more thing  ive been told that i gotta get rid of one of you guys by the end of the week  new sheriff belt tightening you know how it goes  okay carry on  some kind of game houses own version of punkd  its not house its vogler  we cant let it get to us weve gotta stick together why  are you suggesting we start slashing each others throats  im suggesting its a zerosum game your loss is my win thats not conducive to team play  which is what house seems to want look im with cameron  it may be a bad strategy but i dont wanna give house that satisfaction   come on sick kid remember     shes diabetic   no but its similar  msx patients dont respond normally to insulin which causes their body to create too much  and that leads to metabolic abnormalities  were going to do a test to be sure but there are certain dangers  is this thing treatable  its controllable through proper diet and exercise  wait jessica already eats right and she exercises every day  i know youve already seen several nutritionists   and weve done everything theyve recommended  i understand but  why cant any of you doctors see past her weight  if diet and exercise are the treatment then the diagnosis is wrong  it might be but the only way well know is if you let us do this test  its really bad especially at night its like my heart is on fire like its um  oh i dont know like uh   burning exactly  hmm sounds almost like heartburn  so can you give me somethin like a thesaurus  what i take it you never mentioned this during any of your prenatal visits  prenatal   im not pregnant  sorry you dont get to make that call unless you have a stethoscope union rules  i know when im pregnant all right i have six kids  thats why my husband had a vasectomy and we use condoms  vasectomies can reverse themselves condoms break  okay this is what a woman is supposed to look like  okay were not just skin and bones  we have flesh we have curves  you have little people inside you  okay okay  im sorry i guess i must have just been brainwashed by the media  and all those years of medical training   damn right  ill see if i can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood  blood why  the heartburn gotta make sure its not spreading  i dont want to  the test involves some pretty precise measurements  if we dont know exactly how much you weigh we wont get the right answers  let me tell you a secret when i was your age i was heavy too  were you over a hundred   way over kids in my neighborhood used to call me rerun  rerun he was a heavy guy from tv l i used to pretend i liked it but i didnt  how come youre not heavy anymore  ninth grade grew five inches everything kind of evened out  you think thatll happen to me well yeah  your moms tall and you are a little short for your age probably spring right up   obesity isnt something you just grow out of  i take it youve never seen a baby shes not a baby shes 10  and you figure making her feel like crap would do her a world of good   yeah if it gets her off the couch  im sure shes already under enough pressure  not from mummy everything in society tells us we have to be thin to be successful  no society tells you you have to be thin to be attractive and guess what  thats what attractive means that society likes looking at you  i think we should be telling our kids its fine as long as theyre healthy right  you weigh 90 pounds because it makes you healthier  forget it hes just cranky because he knows hes the one whos gonna get the ax  so any thoughts  on what sharons plan for gaza  who you gonna let go  im thinking i can convince vogler it would be more costefficient to keep all of them yeah you should be able to pull that off  most billionaires arent very good with numbers  it will be more costefficient once i grab camerons ass call foreman a spade and chase  well ill grab his ass too  you are uniquely talented in many areas but office politics is not one of them  dont take vogler on   separate or together  together    increasing glucose to 69 milligrams per minute    are you okay  im thirsty   just a little bit longer and youll be done  like dr chase  wanna put some money on it  i said im thirsty just five more minutes  okay sweetheart im not your sweetheart dont call me that   jessica thats not nice  theyre the ones who arent nice  jessica youre not either i dont wanna do this anymore  jessica jessica you have to calm down no no   let me go  check her blood sugar shes gotta be getting hypoglycemic  ive never seen her like this before somethings wrong  let go of me get it out of me  let go of me you son of a bitch you bastard   oh no    shes sedated mrs simms dont worry  hypoglycemia can cause temporary psychosis and is a common complication during an hec procedure  i never wanted it done in the first place  we understand youre upset you were supposed to be monitoring her condition  but instead you were bickering and placing bets  i apologize if it looked like we werent devoting our full attention to your daughter but i assure you  oh please save your pathetic insincerity for your boyfriend  youre wrong she is in fact pathetically sincere and they didnt screw it up   who are you  im from the lab  the blood tests show your daughter was not hypoglycemic which means her psychosis wasnt caused by anything these doctors did   so then what was it caused by  ive no idea  huh but youll be happy to hear it cannot be cured by diet or exercise  what else could cause uncontrollable rage in a 10yearold  nothing that could also cause a heart attack  i assume i dont have to point out that now would be an extremely good time  for one of you to distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea  a hypercoagulable state can cause a blood clot   blood clots can cause a heart attack  more likely to cause a stroke not the psychosis  no youre wrong if a clot made it to the amygdala area of the brain it might cause uncontrollable rage  right because anythings possible but nothings gonna cause multiple clots in a kid this age   shes fat  obesity doesnt cause blood clots   extremely obese patients can get a fat embolus  right after theyve had liposuction which shes clearly never had   how do you know  because we have her medical records  and because no plastic surgeon in his right mind is gonna give a 10yearold liposuction  have you ever met a plastic surgeon who was in their right mind   she hasnt had liposuction  thank you  but what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment  like what diet pills can cause heart attacks and blood clots   her tox screen was negative  wouldnt show overthecounter weight loss drugs  her mother wouldnt give her diet pills she thinks her daughters perfect just the way she is  shes lying  okay you two heparin and warfarin to prevent further clotting  and you find those pills         not diet pills  you might wanna broaden the search just a little  and dontjust ask the mom  if she hasnt mentioned it yet shes not if youre gonna fire someone go ahead and do it  but dont treat us like lab rats testing how long it takes to get us at one anothers throats   so what should i do  i dont give a damn what you do  yes i had noticed your complete indifference  you dont even offer a medical opinion anymore   who would you fire  not my call  i want your opinion  fine its you  either way youre making a choice  chase   because he screwed up an angio a month ago  anyone can make a mistake  right so its the money you resent it but youre gonna tell me that he doesnt need the job  he doesnt appreciate the job  he was ready to go three rounds with cameron for it  he wants the job he just doesnt appreciate it  theres nothing wrong with just wanting to hang out but this is not the place to do it   im surprised  you thought id pick cameron  i didnt think youd pick at all    guess hes not the rise above the fray guy hed like us to think he is  you practically forced it out of him  hes scared of losing his job just like everybody else  ive been thinking youve made it quite clear that youre miserable here  i am not miserable youre not happy  and you are with my job yes  i am exactly where i wanna be doing exactly what i wanna do  think i sense a hint of sarcasm there  why dont you pick yourself quit hmm i was wrong  about vogler or foreman mrs hernandezs pregnancy test  whos mrs hernandez either a woman carrying an alien baby or your newest patient  so you never saw her with any pills she never mentioned anything  no of course not  would it be all right if i uh talk to a couple of her friends  her friends im not gonna interrogate them  i just wanna ask ifjessica ever mentioned anything  its its pretty important shes very sick  i understand its just well  jessica really doesnt have any friends  not one ive tried to help  make the kids include her more but kids can be   kids  i was gonna say jerks    all the fifthgraders are assigned an eighthgrade buddy  maybe you could talk to hers  whats the status on house  he asked for time to complete performance reviews for everyone in his department  and you told him no and gave him how long  a week hell do it  guys never done what hes told i dont see why hes gonna start now  hi edward vogler  is dr house claiming that im forcing him to get rid of one of you  i assume his goal is to stir up antagonism toward me   and your goal is  i am forcing him  ill do whatever i can to ease the transition for whoever he chooses   if youre feeling guilty about your decision there is an easy solution  i dont feel guilty  then why approach me and tell me all this  i dont feel guilty that doesnt mean i dont feel bad  im rich but im still human  i just wanted you to know  that if theres anything i can do for you my doors open  thank you  youre lookin for info thought you already had house all figured out  i do dont know his team though   the ultrasound and biopsy confirmed our worry  the tumor is extremely large at least 30 pounds  oh god its actually a personal record for this clinic  but its completely benign theres no sign of cancer at all    ive already spoken with dr bergin and hes available first thing in the morning  for what  for the surgery  but if its not cancer it cant kill me right  mmm no ill have a huge scar  i wont be able to wear a bikini   you wear a bikini now  yeah you got a problem with that  nope but ive never gone swimming with you  i knew it thats what this is all about  you are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery  yeah thats exactly why i planted a 30pound tumor on your ovary  its not gonna kill me the only thing surgery is gonna do is change the way i look  that is the definition of cosmetic surgery  uh it would also relieve your heartburn and discomfort  yeah right why give an antacid if you can cut someone up  and make them a little easier on your eyes  my husband loves my body he cant get enough of it  you think hes gonna wanna touch me if i look like ive been gutted like a fish   that was unexpected  yeah it was  all she does during recess is run laps around the playground  she says shes exercising but everyone knows its just because no one wants to play with her  i mean im only her buddy because ms ayers assigned her to me  that does not mean i am her friend  ill make sure her doctors are all clear on that  thanks  so has she ever said anything to you about diet pills   ha she told you that too  what do you mean  i totally busted her for taking drugs one day  she totally lied said that they were diet pills her mom had given her  come on get real no way a girl like that is taking diet pills  i didnt give her diet pills i would never do that  right so it was her imaginary mom  she didnt take any pills the girls lying  why would she lie because shes another mean littlejerk   mom  im sorry honey  clemmie didnt lie  i did i took the pills  i told her you gave them to me because i didnt wanna get in trouble   where did you get them i took them from the store  why why would you do that  because i didnt wanna be ugly anymore   oh baby youre not ugly  yes i am  i know you dont think so but i am im disgusting  jessica please dont say that  i just i just wanted to fit in  you know have friends  or at least have one person my age be nice to me   oh  listen the uh  the pills cause blood clots heart attacks and insomnia  it explains everything well keep her overnight to make sure  but uh shell be fine  thank you    i cant believe she was that desperate   yeah im sure that if everyone i knew hated me  couldnt bear to look at me i wouldnt go so far as to shoplift  im not talking about the shoplifting im sure she didnt even know they were dangerous  she probably saw them advertised on tv or over the internet  right so i guess its the media and pharmaceutical companies fault now  not the fact that she cant stop shoveling food down her throat  no one forced her to get fat   no one forced a cancer patient to get cancer  give me a break its not a disease  have you seen the latest research yes i have  what i havent seen lately is a kid eating an apple or riding a bike  you americans cant even compete with the rest of the world in basketball anymore  unless of course its the type you play with a remote control on a bigscreen tv   right  wait wait wait  are you gonna let him say that he insulted our basketball teams         oh my god  it hurts so bad please what happened   shes bleeding  from where   oh my gosh  just please stop it please  diet pills brought her to us we gave her the sores  you think she got a staph infection from something here  im not saying the hospital gave her the sores im saying we did by treating her  warfarininduced skin necrosis   highly unlikely we started her on heparin before the warfarin  who gave her the heparin   i did warfarin she did heparin  sure you didnt both give her warfarin  yes i did not screw up  did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin     nuff said  you were standing right there i was preparing my own dose   yeah right theres gotta be some other cause  none that i can think of  lets fix the mistake  give her unfractionated i v heparin and low molecular weight heparin by subcutaneous injection stat  making me look bad is not gonna save your job  you think youre incapable of making a mistake  you think that im just gonna roll over and take this  house isnt gonna protect you just because you kiss his ass  vogler wants to know what he can do for me  hey stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the patients  she sleeping  as a result of the sedatives yeah cant let her wake up too much pain  warfarininduced skin necrosis  i have no idea what that means  but it says here we gave her the warfarin  and i do know what induced means we did this  at this point its not exactly clear  you should probably talk to dr house  oh you two need time to get your stories straight  he doesnt tell me what to do  so you dont just blindly follow his commands youre your own man  and yet here you are working for a guy you cant stand  i respect him what exactly is it you respect  his attitude toward humanity he thinks were all idiots and liars  how about his attitude toward you plays with you like a cat with a ball of string  what do you want i wanna know if you wanna keep your job  if he chooses to let me go i can live with that   thats not an answer  are you offering to protect me   still not an answer  i want my job  dr chase boss  what was that about he wanted to know what warfarin is i dont know  brr icy  ill definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again  correct all you want course its a bit more productive if theres an actual mistake  right i always forget that part  i gave her the heparin which means the necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin  which is probably why shes not responding to your treatment yet  if you didnt screw up then what is it  you dont have an answer yet  when you come up with something let me know  ill be in the clinic warming up  im the only one whos always stood behind you when youve screwed up  why why would you support someone who screws up  because im not insanely insecure and because i can actually trust in another human being  and i am not an angry misanthropic son of a bitch  im sorry you said you werent angry  who would you fire   no one  not an option  if everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours we could all stay for the same amount of money  figures youd try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt  the problem is the world doesnt work that way just cause you want it to  figures youd stall and refuse to deal with the issue  problem is the world doesnt go away just because you want it to    excuse me dr house  my wife saw you yesterday lucille hernandez  uh hes not in today  my wife said he walked with a cane  hes also got a bit of a drug problem sometimes doesnt show up for weeks   the mri s are rented but um  did you make a decision hes not gonna fire anybody  yes im gonna cut the pay of all four of us  seventeen percent across the board will allow you to keep us all for the same amount of money  i believe its what you suits call a winwin  all right uh iif you can no  lfhe can work it so we keep the current staff for the same amount of money  what difference does it make  its not about the money  this is not a negotiation it never was  i need to know that whatever i ask you to do  however distasteful you find it youll do it  and just as importantly you need to know that      whats going on with my wife   even if i was dr house  physicianpatient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations  she told me about the tumor yeah she also tell you why shes refusing to have it removed  i dont care about a scar and she can always gain the weight back   you want her to regain the weight  yeah i mean only if she wants to  why ive always thought she looked sexiest when she was pregnant  something about knowing shes a mother just makes me want to tell her that and leave me alone  i did you gotta talk to her i couldnt bear it if something happened to her  the tumor is benign nothings gonna happen except maybe some more heartburn  what if it gets even bigger or it changes  you know where to find us buildings not going anywhere  tell her its cancer you obviously dont have a problem with lying oh way to win me over  we got six kids she cant afford to take a chance  you have kids how novel that changes everything  so if mommy gets heartburn one of them might catch on fire  please i dont know what wed do  they are cute  have her come back in what  your plight has moved me tell your wife to come back   the necrosis is getting worse  maybe because were treating her for the wrong thing   have you found the right thing  no  then we continue the treatment hope its just taking longer than it should  at this point it doesnt matter what caused the necrosis   or who   if we dont stop it from spreading itll kill her before the end of the day  what else can we do get rid of it remove the dying flesh before it penetrates the abdominal wall  do it  theres still a chance the heparin treatment could start to take effect  were gonna wait as long as we can but if theres no change in the next few hours  were gonna have to treat the symptoms directly  so you can get rid of the sores through surgery  technically its an amputation  amputation but the sores are  warfarininduced necrosis attacks fatty tissue mainly in the breasts  wait are you talking about cutting off my daughters breasts   shes 10 years old  a radical mastectomy may be her only chance for survival  im sorry but im gonna have to ask you to sign this     could we talk  what no roses no chocolates  if youre here to apologize im not here to apologize  uhoh  that means youre here for something more complicated  do you want to fire me  yes just waiting for an excuse thank god vogler came along whew  its the only reason i can think of why youre insisting that i made a mistake  really because there is another explanation  perhaps not as much fun as your freudian analysis  but maybe you actually made a mistake  youre doing this because you cant deal with your feelings for me  i believe that you are the only one to express feelings  and if were gonna look at this from a firstyear psych point of view maybe you want me to fire you  maybe thats why youre acting weird youre the one being different  youre always pushing things pushing the rules pushing us but not this time  you jumped on this idea like a life raft not one question about what else it could be  no riding us for other answers i have the answer  then why arent you watching tv or playing your damn game boy  or whatever else you have so much fun doing by yourself  maybe i should just quit  make it easy for everyone  maybe you should     men are pigs  you called me in to tell me  i shouldve realized the vasectomy and condoms was overkill but this was too obvious to miss  cute kids  love her green eyes and his baby blues   of course since both you and your husband have brown eyes  whered you get that  from the father of three maximum four of your six children  so im thinking maybe the reason you dont want surgery  is that while your husband will find you attractive no matter what  all the other men youre sleeping with might not be so openminded  which brings me back to my original thesis men are pigs  you got nothing to worry about theyll pretty much have sex with anyone  fat skinny married single complete strangers relatives  you are sick so are you  and im sure there are web sites full of men  iooking for married women with surgical scars  so have the surgery please  okay    thanks  why have you been talking to cameron   if house picks you ill be needing a new source in that room  if he picks me  sure foremans smarter house has got a thing for cameron  ive been feeding you information so youll protect me  and i will protect you as long as i need you  and you will feed me information as long as you need me  i spoke with cameron because if i have alternatives  i dont need you  shes not gonna rat on house  foreman never said anything about talkin to me  interesting huh    its been almost three hours still no change in her condition  i think we should get her into surgery  so what do you wanna do  assume that cameron didnt screw up  what if its not the warfarin it has to be the sores presented right after we administered it  right right right but lets just say its not come on come on what do you got  can i have a second to think no theres no time to think just say the first thing that comes into your head  shes fat enough already okay we got it you hate fat people  thats not what i meant we already considered obesity as a cause  so did all her other doctors no i mean what if its not a cause what if its a symptom  okay so what could cause obesity and skin necrosis  i dont care if it makes sense just give me something   ulcers secondary to vasculitis  no thats just sores not obesity   pyoderma gangrenosum  more sores  lets look at it from the other side what has obesity as a symptom  hypothyroidism genetics are more likely her moms heavy too  shes not just heavy shes tall  we have any history on the dad yeah   kids short  we got stunted growth high blood pressure blood clots obesity   its cushings  no necrosis doesnt present  in rare cases cushings can cause hypercalcemia  which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin  its perfect it explains everything  except its not cushings shes had multiple blood tests and none show abnormal cortisol levels  the hypercortisolism could be cyclical we didnt catch it in the right phase   well have to do another ufc   theres no time weve got less than an hour to make a call  if we treat for cushings and were wrong shes dead  if we assume its not cushings shell lose her breast and may still be sick   do an mri  you want us to look for hypercortisolism with an mri  no i want you to look for what could cause hypercortisolism with an mri     nothing on the adrenals  heard cameron went home is she sick  go back to the pituitary views   she seemed okay  think shes got another reason for leaving  i hope so wait stop  there whats that  huh a tumor  its cushings  the tumor causes cushings cushings messes with hormone production  hormones control everything growth weight  can you fix it shell need surgery to remove the tumor  once its gone everything will get normal very fast   no mastectomy  no  thank god the surgery is dangerous  the pituitarys located between the cavernous sinuses  basically right between the eyes  the area contains the nerves that control eye movement and the major arteries that feed the brain  oh my god  the surgeon will approach the gland transsphenoidally  an incision will be made under the lip  through which hell insert a fiberoptic microscope  once the tumors found hell cut it into small pieces and remove it through the same hole under the lip  the whole procedure should take about three hours and your daughter should be able to go home in a few days  the sores will go away as well as her fatigue and the muscle pain  shell even start losing weight     jessica hi   is that really you  yep its me  you look fantastic   she always looked fantastic  yeah   its been a week  actually its over a week  how have you guys been  who is it  chase  no chase stays pick someone else  the deal was the deals changed   pick someone else  no  mmm  pick someone else or itll be the whole department    thats some bad hat harry
