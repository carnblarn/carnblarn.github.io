                previously on house  you high popo  caught with a sense of humor you can check the cop car  also check his personal car work home  foreman get out  am i the only one who finds this funny   you stole my article  i wouldnt do that  were not friends were colleagues  ow son of a bitch  now were both exposed   im gonna die  you die i die  its not gonna happen  time of death  i need a bone saw   im sorry  you said you  i wish i could  i just want a little tiny slice of this guys brain thats all i need  just enough to tell me whats killing foreman  a thin slice of joes brain could also causea public health crisis  its not a good idea to scream fire every time somebody lights a match  dont downplay this house  you put both of them in isolation for a reason  joes death elevates this situation to a biosafety level 3  ooh level 3   you should call jack bauer  i called the cdc  well tell them ill be really really careful  we dont have the proper equipment for you to be really really careful  you can do whatever you want to foreman but the cdc will do this autopsy  whatever the point is well be lucky to get results in 3 days  i told them how urgent this is  and they told you  well have the results in 3 days  aw thats a shame  because foreman will never get to know what it was hell be dead in 36 hours  maybe this is a toxin maybe its notcontagious at all  and youre killing foreman because of a maybe  well you have 36 hours to figure out which one it is  foreman come here fast  whats going on  when are they doing the autopsy  youre doing it now  you ever study how they used to do ice pick lobotomies  i read about it in med school why would i  shove an ice pick into the eye socket just above the tear duct  bang it a couple of times with a hammer get a sample  whats going on man  foreman you cant do it youll be in violation of  cant do the time if youre not alive  you i need you to suit up get that equipment away from dr foreman  house take your time guys  why dont you just tell him to go slow   wont be your fault  foreman  we dont even know what kind of contagion were dealing with  which is why we need to chop into the guys head   its dangerous  not to you foreman  there are other ways to diagnose you  yeah you have the answer   foreman do it now  i am warning you do not  what are you doing  that didnt feel right  hes blind  he thinks he can see  same as the cop  i need something to bag the sample  forget it you just biopsied a mattress  no no no im fine  house theres the sample get it test it  you gotta test that sample  apparently i was optimistic about the 36 hours  intractable unbearable pain is up next  sure you dont want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing   original airdate fox 3 may2006  physically his eyes are fine  problems isolated to his brain  damage to the occipital lobe extends from the primary visual cortex  should we test him for bacterial meningitis  if it was meningitis wed all be sick   his csf could show signs  that would be pointless  we already did a brain biopsy it was negative   toxic mold  if it was toxic mold id be sick  how do we know youre not sick  do i seem happy to you  never    it was funny  well lets assume its not bloodborne  if you start cracking jokes we can reassess  in the meantime stay away from people and animals that you care about  guillainbarr  neither of them had any sort of paralysis  joe could have died before the paralysis had a chance to present  what about arbovirus  start treatment  for arbovirus  you think our jersey beat cop has been spending a lot of time exploring deep dark africa  treatment  for everything  likely or unlikely if you can think of it treat for it  mixing that many meds will create all sorts of toxic interactions  well box his liver trash his kidneys theres got to be a better way  of course theres a better way  its that body sitting in the room with him that cuddy wont let us touch  bacterials virals toxins fungals parasites its got to be one of them  where are you going  to see if i can find another brain to biopsy  were going to lock joe up downstairs until the cdc gets here  foreman you cant see  right  house wants to start you on some meds  theyre in the airlock  for what  leading candidate is toxic mold  is cameron sick  im fine thanks for asking  youre  casting your net a little wider than toxic mold arent you  guillainbarr is also on the table  this is an oval shape has either an l or a 7 im guessing an l  levofloxacin because you cant rule out bacteria  thats the dosage for the acyclovir in case its viral  square no more like a rhombus thats fluconazole for fungus  theres about 8 others here you  youre treating me for everything  you have no idea what ive got  house thinks this is the best course of action  house is desperate house is never desperate  something we give you will work  yeah we should start treating all patients this way  when they get sick they just take everything  its better than doing nothing    hello  im at the cops place  i need to retrace your steps  you dont think the treat him for everything approach is enough  where did you start your search  the kitchen  you will tell me everything you did everything you touched  if you went to the john i want to know when and why  i started with samples from the mold in his sink   what next  thats it then i left  foreman what do we do now  wait for steve mcqueen to get giddy    hey dad its eric  im not doing too good  hows foreman  youre accessing a webcam  cuddys shower  are you a fan of the brazilian ii  is that your kitchen  well obviously i couldnt bring him here  hes been exposed to whatever foremans got  you infected steve  why didnt you just get a rat from the pet store  because i needed one with a clean medical history  who knowswhat kind of antibiotics they give those rats  so this is your plan just sit here and watch your rat all day  well it shouldnt take long  got the ac blasting i soaped the floor of his cage  as soon as he gets sick i do an autopsy  as soon as hes dead  right after he gets sick theres a good chance hell get hit in the head with a  caneshaped object  normally you just use your patients as lab rats  its a nice change  first symptom is euphoria  how do you know if a rats euphoric  he doesnt usually climb on his water bottle like that does he  the seizures only seem to happen when shes in her car seat   she starts to rock and grunt  she responsive  no no its like shes in a zone  and her abdominal muscles become dystonic  big word  someones been on the interweb  i looked up a few articles on epilepsy  you  know theres actually some really great youth soccer leagues  that would cater specifically to her special needs and  i think it might explain why shes been having a hard time in preschool  lets confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back  strobing lights and highpitched sounds can provoke a seizure   whoo whoo whoo  youre a goof  takes one to know one loser  wait that means im a loser scratch that  these episodes she get sweaty afterwards  soaking wet  and does she seem upset by them or just tired  no she kind of thinks its funny  you mix rocking grunting sweating and dystonia with concerned parents  and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy  in actuality all your little girl is doing is saying yoo hoo to the hoo hoo   shes what  marching the penguin  yayaing the sisterhood  finding nemo   that was funny  its called gratification disorder  sort of a misnomer if one was unable to gratify oneself that would be a disorder  are you saying shes masturbating  i was trying to be discreet theres a child in the room   oh this is horrifying  epilepsy is horrifying  teach your girl about privacy and hell be fine here you go  thank you  one afternoon and youre on pace to set the record for most patients seen in a month  youre upset that im doing clinic hours wow that is so like rain on your wedding day  for the past 3 hours i have been on the phone with the cdc while you are  yeah hows that going by the way  they promised to expedite  tough to do an autopsy when they havent even picked up the body  its tough to treat your patient when youre not even on the same floor  go clinic is covered  i go watch the meds drip into his iv you think thatll make the treatment work faster  go to your office play with your ball  write on your whiteboard insult your team  do whatever it is that you do to figure things out  feeling guilty  its not too late to change your mind  go call the cdc tell em you were just joshing  keep avoiding foremans case until he dies  then ill drown in guilt  feeling any better  how are you doing  im not the patient  is your sed rate elevated  no  so far it looks like i lucked out  c ameron  looks like you left a tourniquet on the bed  you can see again  the treatments working  the question is which treatment  well start weaning him off one at a time  which one do we start with  i dont care if you do it alphabetically just stay on top of his vision  first sign of regression means weve taken him off the wrong one  the latest blood work  foremans  amylase and lipase levels are 3 times normal  pancreas is failing  a toxic side effect of his meds    house philosophical question  how do you want to die  old age  your choice is currently between 4 hours from now and 14 hours from now  so im assuming that means you want the latter  the cocktails working  my visions almost completely restored  the meds are curing whats in your head but theyre trashing your pancreas  thats why youre puking and you cant stand up without screaming  so lower the dosages  less stress on my pancreas still battle the infection  lower dosages will still be toxic  i dont care  i can handle the pain of the pancreatitis  i dont think you can handle life without a pancreas  we keep you on these meds youll spend the last 4 hours of your life being able to see  take you off youll go blind again  but itll give us time to figure out whats eating your brain  fine  what do we do next  man eric  dad  yeah you two can get caught up later sir i need you to come with me  house uhwhat is this  he isnt a what hes a who  they even have the right to vote now  rodney foreman cuddy cuddy rodney foreman   nice to meet you maam  this is foremans dad  yeah i got that  and dr cuddy here is the dean of medicine  remember that cool autopsy i was telling you about the one that would save your sons life  shes the one can give us the green light to do it  i understand you dont want them to do it  dr house didnt seem to know why  mr foreman i am doing everything i can to get the cdc  wont be soon enough  and my decision to follow public health safety protocols  oh dont blame the rules dont want to hang this on policy and protocol  im well aware that it may cost your son his life  just as i am well aware that my decision has a devastating effect on family and friends without having them paraded in front of me  your son has an unknown contagious deadly infection  if we dont contain it here even more people could be at risk  and i am capable of empathizing with those people too without having them paraded in front of me  i understand  whats wrong with your hand  itsits called a muscle contraction  i thought this thing was in your brain  it is  it just means the infections moved to the primary motor cortex which controls the muscles  arent you glad you sent me to med school  does it hurt  no  is it gonna  the the other guy  he didnt seem to suffer too much hejust went in his sleep  steve still acting normal no sign of contractures  they got the cops body in a locked airtight bag  and a guard on the door these feds are seriously paranoid  he hasnt gotten up to peein hours hes due  you havent sprinkled senokot granules on his doughnut  his bowels would open up like the red sea  he wouldnt eat the doughnut  have you seriously been down here for hours  no  i had to pee a couple times  youve got to stop blaming cuddy for this  given that it is her fault that seems appropriate  that part is her fault  the part where somebody wasted his time in the basement  plotting the overthrow of a government agency that ones on you  the only think i can do is think i can pretty much do that anywhere  as long as no ones bugging me  rodney did you call your brother  no  did you  no  its not a big deal  i sure would have liked to see mom though  you know she cant travel anymore  you tell her  why  just upset her for a while  then she wouldnt remember for a while  think she should know  shes lost a lot of who she was  she cant deal with something like this  and you can  i still know youre going to a better place  its easy for you isnt it  as long as you believe im going to a better place dying aint so bad  i dont want you to be afraid  if im not afraid of dying what the hell should i be afraid of dad  i thought you believed  i did  im not so sure anymore  im going to pray for you son  i suggest you do the same  one safe place by marc cohn   how many roads youve traveled    how many dreams youve chased    across sand and sky and gravel    looking for one safe place    yeah    hey yeah    one safe place    yeah    hey yeah    one safe place    yeah    hey yeah     chase field of vision is regressing  and hes reached an 8 on the pain scale  the disease pattern is following the exact course as joes  only its moving much faster in foreman  good its an anomaly  anomalies tell us things  why is this moving faster in foreman whats different  could be a different strain of the same disease  right we were wasting all this time looking for an unknown disease  we should have been looking for a different strain of an unknown disease  joes a cop hes into physical fitness he could have had a  more powerful immune system stronger metabolism  foremans black  what  how long have you been sitting on this information  lupus  gout glaucoma osteoarthritis hypertension diabetes stop me any time  they all affect black people more than whites  check everything  bacterials fungals toxins parasites  look for anything with a documented racial disparity  wait  the rats showing symptoms  no  hes completely healthy  maybe thats the difference between foreman and the cop  how are you feeling  why are you here  because youre a friend and i should be here  im sorry house used my dad to try and manipulate you  youve got integrity you arent going to change your mind just because youre confronted by my father  thank you  just like im not going to forgive you just because you come by here and ask how im feeling  you know ive had no choice  of course you had a choice  regulations are clear  and the punishment for violating those regulations  is it death hmm  because frankly im okay if you get a fine a suspension  hell you can spend a couple of years in jail  if it saves my life   youre dying too fast  couldnt agree more  hey cuddy having a nice visit  whats that   legionel  legionella pneumophila  and why are you carrying a vial of it around with you  foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection  our cop wasnt he had legionnaires disease  our cop didnt turn into brain food until we cured the legionella  legionella slowed down the disease   why would that happen  no idea i just know that it did   so you want to infect foreman  gonna tattle to the cdc  meds cant help me but a disease can  forget it just take the pain away and put me under  if i put you under i cant monitor your pain  if i cant monitor your pain i wont know if the legionellas working  im not consenting to you giving me    foreman what was that  house hmm  i wish there could have been a puff of smoke or something  wouldve been much more dramatic  keep your slippers on  wouldnt want you to cut your foot  are you feeling any better  i cant breathe im dizzy  and i can barely hear anything over the sounds of my lungs crackling   thats the legionella  wow  you figure that out from the symptoms or from the vial of stuff tossed in my room  im trying to be professional here theres no reason to be nasty  im in pain   so is house  and hes a delight  he doesnt try to kill his colleagues   you can remove the thermometer now  its down almost a whole degree  hows the pain  great  this is the good kind  how bad is it compared to an hour ago  no worse  wilson the legionella helping  yeah   good  not great  didnt fix anything it just slowed it down  the point was to give steve a little more time to get sick  what are you going to do if he never gets sick  brilliant  cameron what type of illnesses affect humans but not rats  why are you asking me that  because im sure that you spent the first 12 years of your life dreaming of being a vet  the rat is not getting sick  cameron is not getting sick  sorry  its okay its not your fault  presumably youre still healthy because whatever it is is not bloodborne  steve has no excuse he did everything that foreman did  some bacterial infections dont infect rats  foreman tested negative for every bacterial infection that would affect his brain  and what infections could he be positive for but test negative for  when we test for infections we look for antibodies  but what if the patient is infected but has no antibodies  what if the body is not fighting the infection   why would  eeeeh i asked first  lets start with what well deal with the why later  if the body doesnt recognize the infection our tests come back negative  and the disease rampages through the body unstopped  exactly like the cop and exactly like foreman  and what if the patient was then exposed to a second infection  like legionella  the body would recognize that infection increase the white count send in the troops to start fighting  and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire  so the question becomes what type of bacteria infecition affects humans but not rats  and the human body would be unlikely to recognize  the answer is listeria  im starting you on ampengent amp and gent  so youre basing this theory on the test being negative and your rat being healthy  and in fact that legionella is helping you  but the medicine you want to give me put an end to that  yeah  and if its not listeria the gent will do is cure the legionnaires disease  and put whatever is killing me back into overdrive  stop asking me questions based on the premise that im wrong  the antibiotics are in the airlock  i think the first biopsy didnt give us the answer because you didnt go deep enough  i want you to do a white matter brain biopsy  absolutely dont blame you  the world is such a complicated place if youve got higher reasoning skills  im often jealous of small animals and retarded children  take the antibiotics  there can be minimal damage if its done right  if the surgeons drill where i tell them to drill  one slip you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth  id rather be disabled than dead  sure i make it look oh so sexy  its actually not as glamorous as you might think  the biopsy will tell us for sure whats wrong  the antibiotics could do the same thing   could not will  we try it we see  the antibiotics will bring back the pain  pain makes us bad decisions  fear of pain is almost as big a motivator  look we still have time  i will do that biopsy if i have to  but not a moment before  start foreman on iv antibiotics  wheres his dad  where you supposed to be when your son is dying  hes not with him  hes in the chapel  i started your son on a new course of treatment  if it works hell get better  if it doesnt he wont  while hes not getting better  hes going to experience so much pain  that will have to put him on a chemicallyinduded coma  while we figure out what to do next  my son says youre a manipulative bastard  its a pet name  i call him dr bling  i assume youre here for a reason what do you want from me  when your son is in a coma  youre the one whos gonna have to make the medical decisions for him  oh whatever you decide is fine   you dont care what i do  im not a doctor what do i know  except what eric tells me  he says youre the best doctor hes ever worked with  i need your help  theres nothing i can give you for the pain  i want to be put out  i can have a nurse in here in 5 minutes  no  want some help  i might not come back  ive never done a will  ill call a lawyer for you  i want you to be my medical proxy  all the things that piss me off about you in houses office  youre too emotional too caring too cautious  theyre all good things on this floor   your dad is  no   he cares about you  so do you  i cant do this  we expect family members to make decisions about their loved ones  after a 10minute briefing that were agonizing over even with years of medical experience  thats from my article  im sorry allison  i shouldnt have stolen your article i shouldnt have exposed you  you were a friend i need to know that were okay  no  ill be your proxy but were not okay  youre scared youre dying and thats the only reason you want to set things right  were going to get you better first  and then  if you still want to apologize ill be around  ill call that lawyer  any improvement  well as far as we can tell the only thing the antibiotics are treating is the legionella  i think we need to consider alternate theories  like what   we do the biopsy we  give the antibiotics more time  there is no more time the pain is almost unbearable already  so hes almost in unbearable pain hes not almost dead  which means we have more time  mr foreman  we need to put your son in a coma  you should be there  its a medical procedure right  yeah  but once we put him out ifif we dont solve this  he wont wake up  what should i say  should i talk to him like its going to be okay  or should i be saying goodbye  i need to know what people say when  just tell him you love him  hey son  hey dad  its going to be okay  you dont know that  i know  you dont  i dont want to miss you  i love you too dad    hey  its going to be okay   can we do this now  yeah of course  i accept your apology    why werent you with foreman  i hang out in the basement you rag on me i stay in my office you rag on me   honkey just cant buy a break  do the biopsy  based on the cops progression i figure hes got about another 4 hours before  you figure  youre playing russian roulette but the guns pointed at him  no cutting open his head is whats dangerous  oh its dangerous well what would people think  the reason you dont see patients is because if you know them youll give a crap about them  i know you  if you give a crap you stop making outrageous calls  if this was any other patient youd have damned the risk and cut their head open a long time ago  hes out the eeg shows hes still in pain  the antibiotics have had more than enough time were doing the brain biopsy  not unless you people cant come up with something clever in the next 3 hours  now were doing it now  who died and made you boss  foreman  its legal  house hes out of his mind  yesterday he was giggling about a hole in a guys head  then hire a lawyer and challenge it  in the meantime camerons in charge  why would he sign that  its nothing personal mr foreman  my son doesnt trust me how exactly is that not personal  im sorry  youre sorry  youre talking about this mans son  youre denying him the right to be a part of  oh shut up house  if you want to do the biopsy do the biopsy  if house tries to interfere let me know and i will take care of it  yeah youre a hero if it wasnt for you wed be cutting into a dead guys head instead of foremans  sorry  thanks   that was great  it was rude and unnecessary   yeah  go away  give me time   were out of time  an hour  what does out of time mean  his o2 stats are  his lungs are about 90 the danger of fatal arrhythmia doesnt increase  so what theres no point in waiting  you were right we should be cutting into a corpses head  yeah we should be except the cdcs got the cops body and  theres got to be other bodies  you think this thing has killed other people  no  that apartment was a dump  just because steve mcqueen didnt get sick doesnt mean some other vermin didnt  you give me an hour i go back there i find a dead animal i cut its head open instead of foremans  foremans already on 100 oxygen  once his o2 seds hit 90 i cant wait any longer  wheres your suit  either youll find the answer or ill find the answer  doesnt matter  chase prep the drill  weve got to be ready to go forget the signal    i found a blind bird  cameron great  how fast can you get it in here  ill know in about 30 seconds     you better have the bird the surgical teams in place  i screwed up  how can you not capture a blind bird  thats not what i meant  i screwed up the first time through this place  foreman told you everywhere he went  its not where its when  he came here early afternoon  me and steve came through you were 6 hours early  its the water the irrigation system only pumps  house i tested the water the waters clean   house  we tested the wrong water  he stole cable he stole fertilizer and he stole water  its riddled with naegleria  i know  you already did the biopsy  i thought i had no choice  hows my son  he has primary amebic meningoencephalitis  its a parasitethat goes through the nose and migrates into the brain where it feeds on brain cells  the legionella attacked the parasite thats why the disease slowed down  is it treatable  we started him on an antiparasitic and the amoebas will clear out of his system  and hell be okay  thenthen well wean him out of the coma  will he be okay  therell be no lasting damage from the parasite  but the surgery  we dont know   how many roads weve traveled    how many dreams weve chased    across sand and sky and gravel    but looking for one safe place    yeah    hey yeah    one safe place    yeah    hey yeah    up and at em  how are you feeling  can you talk  i dont feel anything  are you numb  no i  i mean i dont feel any pain  keep your head still follow my finger  im okay  your breath stinks and youre peeing into a bag  what are our names  you did the biopsy  thank you  names  cameron  my dad  and the manipulative bastard  you remembered    how you doing dad  great  relieved great  what did i have  naegleria  biopsy showed the amoeba  cdc autopsy eventually found the amoeba  and house found it in the water on the cops roof  wiggle your left toes  foreman wait wait  you went back and she did the biopsy  your left toes foreman  i just did  no you didnt  he cant move his toes  he can move them  raise your right arm  what
