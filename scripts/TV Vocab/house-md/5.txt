                    we are condemned to useless labor  fourth circle ofhell  charting goes a lot faster when you eliminate all classic poetry  writing down what we already know to be read by nobody  im pretty sure dante would agree that qualifies as useless  youre over two weeks behind in your charting  oops i missed   what are you eight  could an eightyearold do this  youd better stop or itll stick that way   you have a patient in exam one  yeah but see im off at 1200 and its already five of  shes been waiting for you since 1100  melancholy without hope which circle is that  hi im dr house  what seems to be the problem show him your hands augustine   itit looks like stigmata  shh pius  you must be all the talk around the holy watercooler  been washing a lot of dishes recently i help out in the kitchen   anything new in the kitchen  we just got a donation of saucepans and pots this week   i unpacked and washed them  should have spent your time saving souls its easier on the hands  this is contact dermatitis youre allergic to dish soap  nonsense weve always used that soap why is there a problem now  ive been a doctor for years why do i have to keep assuring people that i know what im doing  aperson can become allergic to substances  that theyve had repeated and prolonged exposure to  the good news is free samples  diphenhydramine its an antihistamine  itll stop the allergic reaction  take one every eight hours it might make you feel a little sleepy  and get some of that overthecounter cortisone cream thank you doctor  you want some water i have some tea  well you just relax for a few minutes that stuff works pretty fast    still out by 1200  how do you solve a problem like dermatitis what  doctor i want to thank you for your patience  she talkin to you i dont know shes certainly looking at me  ah its good to get a secular diagnosis  the sisters tend to interpret their illnesses as divine intervention  and you dont then youre wearing an awfully funny hat  ooh boy excuse me  if i break my leg i believe it happened for a reason  i believe god wanted me to break my leg  i also believe he wants me to put a cast on it  doctor somethings wrong    lift up your chin  sister youre having an asthma attack i need you to relax  roll up her sleeve please im gonna give you epinephrine     itll open your lungs and help you breathe    what happened did she take the pill   yes  its probably an allergic reaction  shes allergic to an antiallergy medicine  you figure somebodys out to get her   how are you feeling   better  ill put you on some steroids instead   is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny  its called adrenaline   it makes your heart beat fast     but not this fast    get a nurse please hold on  help somebody help us  somebody get in here  call a code and charge up a defibrillator shes got no pulse     you diagnosed the patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine  she went into respiratory distress  and you injected her with epinephrine  presumably 1 cc  1 cc that is the standard dose that is what i gave her  people dont go into cardiac arrest from1 cc epinephrine  she must have a preexisting heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine  its too bad you didnt make a notation in the chart  i can make it up right now  the drawer has syringes with both dosages you could have reached for the wrong   but i didnt  everyone makes mistakes  this is why doctors pay through the nose for malpractice insurance  relax theyre not gonna sue  the worst theyd do is whack my hand with a ruler   and the discipline board are they gonna whack your hand too  youre gonna report me   what choice do i have  uh how about not report me  i can justify keeping her here for a 24hour observation  if you havent found an underlying cause for the cardiac arrest by then  i will have to notify our attorneys   her hands were red and swollen  maybe she has a skin infection cellulitis that could manifest with tachycardia  theres no history of fever results from the cbc didnt indicate an infection  the eosinophils are mildly elevated sed rates up a bit could we be looking at a systemic allergic response  its not allergic allergies dont cause cardiac arrest like this   could be inflammation of the blood vessels  vasculitis that wouldnt give you an elevated eosinophil count  churgstrauss vasculitis would  the blood vessels of the heart lungs and skin become inflamed  causing the asthma rash and heart problems covers all her symptoms  you need a biopsy to diagnose chest ct would be quicker  the lady just came in with a rash  what the hell are those  candy canes  candy canes are you mocking me  no itits christmas and l  i thought relax its a joke   isnt the prognosis for churgstrauss a bit grim  yeah untreated only 33 of patients survive past a year  treated five years then i definitely suggest treatment  if it was any other attending doctor id say that he made a mistake  and gave her too much epinephrine  saying you wouldnt say it was my mistake  is saying it was my mistake  everyone screws up your rule  i think you fit within the subset ofeveryone  i didnt screw up   order a chest ct and start the sister on prednisone 40 milligrams tid  the sister  oh didnt i mention the patients a nun sister augustine   i hate nuns  who doesnt       sister augustine  we werent watching   we were trying to see if this is the bed control  oh uh this ones the bed control  and thats the tv control  im dr cameron this is dr chase and dr foreman  i havent seen television in over 20 years  do you consider it the work of the devil  or do you just not get cable where you live   um  how are you feeling sister  i seem to be a little better they gave me some medication  prednisone its a steroid to help with the inflammation  has dr house figured out what i have  will i be okay were not sure whats wrong yet  youll have a chest ct scan this afternoon thatll help with the diagnosis  dr house is giving her medication and he doesnt know what she has yet  trust sister pius it all happens for a reason   he doesnt know what hes doing  the only problem that woman has is that house grabbed the wrong syringe  you dont trust him i dont trust a man who wont admit he might be wrong  i notice you werent so quick to tell her shes got churgstrauss and only has a couple years left  i dont tell patients bad news unless its conclusive  because you know he might be wrong  about churgstrauss not about what happened in the clinic   what about you chase you think hes infallible too  all i know is if house didnt make a mistake and sister augustine has churgstrauss  hell be selfsatisfied and our lives will be good for a few weeks  if house did make a mistake hell be upset and our lives will be miserable for months   there is that  if cuddy thinks i made a mistake the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty  she doesnt confuse making a mistake with being incompetent  oh here we go lesson time  i recognize that confidence is not my short suit  i also recognize that i am human and capable of error  so you might have screwed this up no  so its merely a theoretical capacity for error good point  maybe there isnt one maybe thats my error  most people who think as much of themselves as you do like to talk about themselves  most people dont like to listen so whats wrong with you    let me guess inflammatory bowel   wow yeah is it that bad yes  its also written on your chart  bloody diarrhea gas pain  took sulfasalazine but it didnt work   no thenthen l   next tried steroid enemas  oral corticosteroids5asa   im impressed  by my medical history  by how well your last doctor charted  its one thing to have to go to the bathroom every hour  but when the kids sit on my lap its  the store sent me home theyre gonna fire me  cant you put me back on 5asa maybe itll work this time not likely  im giving you a prescription its cheap which is good  because your insurance company wont pay for it   cogaritis  cigarettes  one twice a day no more no less  studies have shown that cigarette smoking  is one of the most effective ways to control inflammatory bowel  plus its been well established that you look 30 cooler   are you kidding me  about the looking cooler yeah   the rest is true  isnt it addictive and dangerous  pretty much all the drugs i prescribe are addictive and dangerous  the only difference with this one is its completely legal  merry christmas   i was talking to the nursearsenio do you know him  not really he can take pictures with his phone  cool that woman from the lab was interesting too  she studied astrophysics before becoming a nurse  you know the staff better than i do i love to hear all about people   yet you live in a monastery  its where i serve our lord and the world best  our lord maybe the rest of the world on the other hand   would probably get more out of feeding the homeless or  healing the sick  as an example yeah did you always want to be a doctor  always you always want to be a nun my parents died when i was six  i was raised in a foster home run by the church  when i was 18 i went to the monastery where they let me take my vows  ive known no other life and i havent wanted to   okay sister we need you to lie as still as possible  if you get scared just let us know  as jonah said from inside the whale  when i had lost all hope i turned my thoughts to the lord    well shes got god on her side   i dont believe in god  youre not even a little agnostic  is it supposed to smell funny  someone ralphed in there this morning we cleaned it up but   its normal sister its just a few more minutes  mm  i believe in a higher order thats in control of what happens  but not one anthropomorphic entity called god  thats concerned with the everyday workings of you and me  what else is there to control but the everyday workings of you and me  its always about you foreman  what are you talking about the trees the fish  should they be the ones that think its all about them  what about you chase do you believe in god  i believe sister augustine has no vascular pathology which means no churgstrauss  which means house made a mistake no not necessarily  it could be something else thyrotoxicosis or a carcinoid i dont get you  you dont believe in god but youre willing to put complete faith in one man   please the smell lets get her out of there   im coming sister i gotcha   please the smell im comin  im gonna be sick theres no smell  no god oh its jesus its jesus   hes coming for me  hes burning me with his touch  lets get her on some ativan  the smells religious visions its symptomatic of temporal lobe swelling   we dont want her to  shes seizing   jaw block  help me get her on her side   religious visions  yeah and next comes  patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis   whats that tell us  her immune system is severely compromised  oh i know prednisone compromises the immune system   isnt that the medicine that you gave her for that thing she doesnt have  yeah that hey   im thinking thats a trick question  her immune system is severely compromised   two doses of prednisone wouldnt do that  are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb   in 10 seconds im going to announce that i gave her the wrong dose in the clinic  youre gonna admit negligence  unless you leave the room if you stay youll have to testify  five four  three two  so there i was in the clinic drunk   i opened the drawer closed my eyes  take the first syringe i can find  so what are the options for a compromised immune system  mixed connective tissue disease itd explain why she was feeling better on the prednisone  sure she was feeling better right up to the moment it almost killed her  on the other hand it explains the symptoms  swollen hands pulmonary problems cardiac problems  it all fits except her ana was normal   so redraw the blood  but the treatment is corticosteroids  prednisone and we cant go there because of the encephalitis  then well treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesnt suppress it  hyperbaric oxygen chamber  theres no protocol for putting a patient in a highpressure oxygen room to treat autoimmune problems  oh you people always with the protocols  prep the nun and discontinue the prednisone  i am both amused and annoyed  that you think i should be less stubborn than you are  you are aware of the hippocratic oath right  the one that starts first do no harm then goes on to tell us no abortions no seductions  and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone  yeah i took a read once wasnt impressed  hyperbaric treatments could cause oxygen toxicity lung and eye damage  every treatment has its dangers which is why we only treat  if were convinced the patient actually needs the treatment  im convinced youre not  question is what are you gonna do about it hmm  i have an opening thursday at 300 do you have a fourth  is he any good   can i call you right back okay  whats up   the pressure will force the oxygen into your system saturate your blood  it will enhance white cell activity reduce the inflammation  and that will help with this mixed connective tissue disease  well be doing about 10 treatments and then well reevaluate   the last treatment with prednisone caused the seizures right  how confident is dr house about this   that you reacted so strongly to the prednisone let us know  that you had an underlying problem with your immune system  i guess it was a blessing of sorts   so whos your favorite reindeer nurse arnold  rudolph i wouldve thought it was vixen  what are you implying nothing  but i saw you at the christmas party with dr riles  and dr jorkins and nurse crandall   i was just doing some christmas dancing   this is a chapel a house of prayer    house of prayer huh  that explains the good reception  also why nobodys ever here  i need to talk with you dr house  sister augustine believes in things that arent real  i thought that was a job requirement for you people  shes been known to lie to get sympathy  shes a hypochondriac  so youre warning me that i may be treating a nonexistent ailment  sore throats joint pains  theres always something wrong and theres never a reason for it  mother superior plays right into it  lets augustine off work duties  treating her as fragile special  that must make you angry  it bothers me  its not really in augustines best interests  you want some  i shouldnt  i guess you gotta be good at reading people to be a good infirmarian huh  mm mmhmm  so weve got pride anger envy gluttony  thats four out of seven deadly sins in under two minutes  do you people keep records of these things is there a cathlympics  they say you have a gift they like to talk   you hide behind your intelligence  yeah thats pretty stupid  and you make jokes because youre afraid to take anything seriously  because if you take things seriously they matter  and if they matter when things go wrong i get hurt   im not tough im vulnerable  i barely know you  and i dont know if im right i just hope i am  because the alternative is  you really are as miserable as you seem to be  you know from the way youre looking at me right now  id say you just hit number five  lust   dr brown i love you too      how are you feeling a little weak   thats from the oxygen  my mouth is dry  okay well uh ill get you some of your tea  mixed connective tissue disease her ana is barely elevated  thanks for checking up on her good to know you got my back  o2 sats down to 83 pulmonary problems breathing problems  irritation from the oxygen is typical  she comes in with a rash and you put her into cardiac arrest   that well just never runs dry does it  if there was no underlying problem why is she still having the rapid heart rate  maybe from the herpetic encephalitis caused by you giving her prednisone  her reaction is a symptom not an error  theres always an explanation isnt there yes there is  and if this one doesnt work well find another but never one involving you screwing up  one that fits all the facts  look we obviously have a difference of opinion and thats fine  but unfortunately ive used up all the time i budgeted today for banging my head against a wall  im gonna do you the biggest favor one doctor can do for another  i am gonna stop you from killing your patient  youre off the case  were gonna treat the symptoms not the underlying condition  there is no underlying condition whats her status  the sisters breathing is labored  pneumonitis from the hyperbaric chamber  put her on 40 oxygen until her o2 sats increase bun and creatinines rising  alt and ast twice the normal range  could be from the hypotensive episode lets follow them with labs  she still has the rash and joint pain she came in with  order a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory when we were looking at the differential diagnosis with dr house  we were considering i dont need to hear what dr house was considering  all of this womans symptoms can be traced to dr houses considerations  okay  lets just get this patient healthy  i want her going out the front door and not the back  hey its not like i betrayed him  cuddy would have found out about the hyperbaric treatments eventually  you did what you thought you had to   cant get enough of this place huh  came for my stethoscope  so i shouldnt read too much into the fact that you were looking for it  in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it  okay yeah id like to clear my reputation  oh right i forgot how much you care about what people think  prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel  thats uhthey cause lung cancer you know  you know why they have ribbons for breast cancer  colorectal cancer prostate cancer and not for lung cancer  they ran out of colors  its because people blame lung cancer patients  they smoke they screwed up they deserve to die  the reason people die from lung cancer is guilt  huh well guilt does a lot of damage  you said that with great significance  youre not here to find your stethoscope youre not here to clear your reputation  youre here because youre having doubts you might have screwed up  im here because if im right cuddy is killing that patient  okay but if youre wrong  then shes saving her fine  youre gonna have to go through every record of every patient  whos been through this clinic in the last two days  and youre gonna have to hope that those records can be trusted  which by the way yours cant  these pills will help your kidneys function a little better sister  get your wrist  whats that   is that good its fine  youre a lousy liar dr chase   i have to get this excuse me    my mothers been dead for 10 years  but shes always with you in spirit  what do you know about the nun which one  the cute one i think she likes me   the sick one obviously  her parents died when she was a child  shes been with the church ever since whats she lying about   why do you say that  i always say that  and the old nun thinks the sick nun is a big fat nun liar  you know nuns what do you think i dont know nuns  you hate nuns you cant hate someone if you dont know them  know any nazis maybe i hate them on principle  i have a theory about what makes good boys good  its not because of some moral imperative  good boys have the fear of god put into them  catholic church specializes in that kind of training  to make good boys afraid of divine retribution  so theyll do what their daddies tell them  like for example going into medical school when its the last thing they wanna do  what do you think  i think if she did have a secret her boss would know    did you paint or put in new carpets recently no  any way she could have got access to drugs  we lock all our medications in the infirmary and we dont keep prescription drugs here  why havent you asked sister augustine about these things directly  ive found that when you want to know the truth about someone  that someone is probably the last person you should ask  ah and have you been speaking to sister eucharist  she ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly oh  if i were you id have her repeat a year of nun school   well becoming a nun doesnt make you a saint  becoming a doctor doesnt make you a healer  and just because we live in a monastery and we spend most of our time in prayer  doesnt mean we dont find time for drama  so what is the sick ones drama  sister augustine lived in catholic foster care until she came to us     tea  sure  do all of you lie  its a good strategy  its simpler when you all tell the same lie  she has not spent her entire life as a good catholic  when she had a cardiac arrest i had to open her blouse to do cpr  and i learned two things nuns can have nice breasts  and she has a tattoo on her shoulder of a skunk  now maybe its the sacred skunk ofjoseph  but as far as i know catholic foster care and monasteries  do not keep tattoo parlors in their refectories  we consider that our life begins  when we put on our habits and take our vows   what happens before then  is irrelevant to you but its relevant to me  sister augustine went into foster care when she was six years old  but she left when she was 12  she lived on the streets she got into drugs  when she was 15 she became pregnant  tried to selfabort  she lost the child she became ill  we took her in when she came back  if we had thought it was medically relevant we would have told you  its not  this tea is delicious local herbs  any change with the medication yes shes getting worse  lung functions deteriorating bun and creatinine continuing to rise  shes starting to run a fever and the rash is spreading  at this rate shes not gonna make christmas maybe house is right  maybe there is an underlying condition that explains the symptoms  something we havent considered like what  it could be a metabolic disorder specifically  might be genetic specifically  im just saying youre just saying you think house is right  might be right of course he might be right  it might be the hand of god at work dont say its something else  unless youve got something concrete to offer  whats this hemlock  im gonna do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another  im gonna stop you from killing your patient  its figwort tea great for that little pickmeup were all looking for in the morning  opens the lungs increases the blood pressure stimulates the heart  unfortunately if you then get injected with even1 cc of epinephrine  instant cardiac arrest   still what the hell it tastes great  sister augustine  has been drinking it religiously so to speak  and if you take the cardiac arrest out of the equation  all the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a severe longterm allergic reaction  well thats what cameron said in the beginning  yes she did well done  but your unwillingness to stick by your diagnosis almost killed this woman  take a lesson from foreman stand up for what you believe  okay lets go figure out how to save a nun  damned if you do damned if you dont   because its been untreated for so long  its gone from a simple  watery eyes scratchy throat allergy  to a whopping im gonna kick your ass allergy  compromising her immune system diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organ systems  so whats the source  the dish soap  no the symptoms persisted days after the dishwashing episode  its gotta be something shes been exposed to here in the hospital as well as the monastery   what about the tea it caused her arrhythmia  could be but its not definitive   well skintest for allergens  not yet shes too reactive  she tests positive to everything we need to stabilize her  isolate her from all possible allergens give her system a rest   get her in a clean room  okay  then gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds  when she reacts to something well know thats whats killing her  there you go no television no books   not even my bible  im afraid not  this room has filtered air filtered water  you even have silk sheets very decadent and hypoallergenic  you should be feeling better here    well be back to check on you in a little while  can the other sisters come in and pray with me  itd be better if you dont have any visitors  once we isolate whats causing your allergy  then we can be a little more lax       li can pray with you  i dont wanna die   why has he left me  i was in seminary school  they asked us once what our favorite passage was  i chose first peter chapter one verse seven  these trials only test your faith to see whether or not it is strong and pure  your faith is being tested as fire tests gold and purifies it  and your faith is far more precious to the lord than mere gold  so if your faith remains strong after being tested  it will bring you much praise and glory and honor  on the day of his return  he hasnt left you    the only thing in the way of you knowing hes there is your fear  you have a choice faith or fear thats the test  choosing faith doesnt mean i wont die  but it will affect how you experience your death  and therefore your life  its up to you  why did you leave seminary school  that test  you passed i didnt  well call you if anything changes will she be all right  as long as shes not exposed to anything that can aggravate her allergy shell be fine   i need some help in here    screw the procedure shes in anaphylactic shock  no way shes in a damn clean room you kidding me  get in here   1 cc of epi  weve got to intubate   i got it get the ambu bag   im in      breathings stabilized  its a clean room   how do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room  maybe it was the preservatives in the iv checked that  latex tubing checked that checked everything  well it could be mast cell leukemia it can cause anaphylaxis  i checked the blood levels and its not eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylaxis  maybe its just divine will  its not my will  you do realize if youre wrong about the big picture that is  youre going to burn right  what do you want me to do just accept it pack it in  yeah i want you to accept that sometimes patients die against all reason  and sometimes they get better against all reason  no they dont we just dont know the reason  i think the nuns would agree with you on that    i just wanted to say that i know that you did everything you could  i dont need verification from you to know that im doing my job well  thats your problem not mine i was just being nice  yeah well you dont need to always do that  merry christmas  sister augustines been extubated  good shes requested to check out against medical advice  she wants to go back to the monastery  well talk her out of it  i think i may have talked her into it    rooms paid up for the rest of the week  might as well stick around  this illness is a test of my faith  if its his will to take me it doesnt matter where i am  i can accept that  does anybody believe anything you say  youre not accepting  youre running away  just like you always do  you ran away from the monastery to get laid  you ran away from the real world when getting laid didnt work out so good  now things arent working out again so off you go  why is it so difficult for you to believe in god  what i have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief  faith isnt based on logic and experience  i experience god on a daily basis  and the miracle of life all around  the miracle of birth the miracle of love  he is always with me  where is the miracle in delivering a crackaddicted baby  hmm  then watching her mother abandon her cause she needs another score  miracle oflove  youre over twice as likely to be killed  by the person you love than by a stranger  are you trying to talk me out of my faith  you can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife  and heaven and hell  but when it comes to this world dont be an idiot  cause you can tell me that you put your faith in god to get you through the day  but when it comes time to cross the road i know you look both ways  i dont believe he is inside me and is going to save me  i believe he is inside me whether i live or die  then you might as well live  you got a better shot betting on me than on him  when i was 15  i was on every kind of birth control known to man   and i still got pregnant  i blamed god i hated him for ruining my life  but then i realized something  you cant be angry with god and not believe in him at the same time  no one can not even you dr house  howd it go she has god inside her  it would have been easier to deal with a tumor  maybe shes allergic to god  weve looked everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction  except one place inside her  on her medical history she didnt mention any surgery she had one  can we get her records what hospital was it at she didnt have it at a hospital  order a full body scan what if she refuses  tell her im looking for a miracle   no piercings no fillings  no surgical pins in the arm no implants  its clean as a whistle whats house looking for   what is that  dont know  lock on it get a 3d representation    oh my god  the copper cross a form of birth control pulled off the market in the 80s   so shes allergic to copper  rare but it happens  wouldnt she know she had an iud  she had an abortion iud must have been left in  embedded in the endometrial tissue where it couldnt be detected  so all we have to do is remove the iud  then the symptoms should subside  i got this iud when i was 15 itits been more than 20 years  prolonged exposure to an allergen with minimal symptoms  but at some point all it takes is one last contact to cause a fullblown reaction  just like a balloon filled with air one last breath it explodes  the first time i got the rash was when i was washing the copper cookware  and all your subsequent symptoms came from ingesting food prepared in it  dr house found his miracle  i doubt hell interpret it that way    you told me your favorite passage  would you like to hear mine  celebrate and be glad  because your brother was dead and is alive again  the prodigal son  hell be waiting for you when youre ready  well schedule your surgery for tomorrow  the sixth circle of hell  confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose and all the tissues are soggy  i think thats the seventh no the seventh is  god you must be fun at parties i think we both know the flaw in that theory  hows the sister heart rate is normal kidneys functioning  you know how it is with nuns you take out their iuds they just bounce right back  great told you i didnt screw up  you screwed up i gave her1 cc of epinephrine  yeah and if cuddy hadnt taken you off the case you would have killed her  you wanna come over for christmas dinner  yourejewish yeah hanukkah dinner  what do you care its food its people no thanks  maybe ill come to your place your wife doesnt mind being alone at christmas  im a doctor shes used to being alone  i dont wanna talk about it neither do i  you did good with the nun   congratulations  thank you  merry christmas dr house dr wilson  good night  that was sweet                thats some bad hat harry
