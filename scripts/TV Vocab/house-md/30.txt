for two weeks  tomorrow scheduling disaster you dont want to hear it  you gotta get the boys okay to move the hearing up  and you gotta do that whole legal advice thing   will you ask someone else  im asking you  let me work with chase house should have separate counsel  stop looking for whatever youre looking for  for the last month house has been crowing that you cant work with him because youre just swooning in love  there is nothing approaching love in what i feel about him right now  well if you cant work with him it amounts to the same thing   we had a fight its awkward why not use another lawyer  because 40 of our lawsuits last year were about house  you cant work with him you cant work here  house shes overreacting  wilson you snuck into her shrinks office and read her private file  when nixon did that he got impeached  so youre saying im not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either   yes  and yes  the file got me on the floor of her attic with her pouring out her soul  the only thing i did wrong was get caught  stacy wheres chase  hes too busy to service you until after work  house i got a couple of minutes though  feel free to say something like  whatll we do with the time left over  or you could just stew that works as well  she stews before she gets violent  this one says youre okay with moving the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow  this one says ive advised you of your legal rights  uh huh any legal rights i should know about  nope   great  and you thought this was going to be awkward  you shouldnt sign it  postponing is almost always the smart thing to do tempers cool memories fade   they rule on me its done right  yeah but  then lets get it over with   have you ever done a peer review before  no  good  heres a misnomer these are your bosses  this will cost you some money some privileges  or it could cost you your career  all i can tell them is what happened  theres an objective reality to what happened and that committee is never going to know it  all theyre going to know is what they picture happened  which depends a little on what you tell them and a whole lot  on how you tell them  may 11th   patient presented to the clinic  whats her name   its in the file  do you know it  then use it  kayla presented to the clinic with multiple joint and stomach pain  chase dr foreman was called in for a neurological consult  sam whats the point of this man  checking your sisters cerebral coordination  the thing is in her leg and her stomach  wait in the clinic for six hours so she can play patty cake  she could have gone to the er last night  oh yeah you wanna come over and babysit her kids  stacy ok patient comes from a family of jerks i get it  can you stick to the medicine  something wrong  chase there was some uveitis  stacy meaning  her iris the colour part of her eye was inflamed  meaning  worst case blindness  but there was an upside  it was weird enough to get house interested  young woman joint pain gonorrhea is a possibility  its probably articular maybe rheumatoid  its typically small joints its her knee  takayasus arthritis  get a sed rate and serologies  child proof  how many kids are hopped up on vicodin  gimme  right  like id ever get it back  chase  stacy dont care about the vicodin    might not just be her arteries could be all her blood vessels  vasculitis with stomach pain so bichettes  no shed have oral sores  or genital  go find them  i thought she was foremans patient why did you do the exam  foreman shed have oral sores  house or genital go find them  woah woah foreman chase can handle the pelvic  any pain  is it bad  this will go a little easier if you talk to me  im sorry  i umm i just really hate hospitals  when i was 12 had my tonsils out  got to skip school lots of ice cream made me want to be a doctor  my mom died when i was 8 so  i spent months at princeton general  she died of tts your mom  bottles stashed around the house mood swings that whole deal  youve been there  my mom dad left mom crawled inside a bottle  made for a great year 12 of high school  you ok with your dad now  no  does your dad have anything to do with this story  no its just  okay i get it the two of you bonded which is why you probably havent been sued  patients never sue doctors they like but keep it brief ok  the panel doesnt like to think theyre being manipulated when theyre being manipulated  she had some ulceration  confirming bichettes  i gave her some prednisone an antacid  and i ran a pathogy test on her arm takes 24 hours to confirm  told her any doctor could check it out  you didnt make an appointment  nope she just showed up   uh huh  dr chase  hi  all right lets take a look  okay those little pustules means its positive  talk to nurse previn get an appointment with dr broston in rheumatology  bichettes is very treatable youre going to be fine  okay thanks  and you were just chatting on the phone to someone and she just happened to run into you  thats what happened  no appointment no real examination  just gave her the test results  so lower standard of care you really couldnt be expected to notice there was anything else wrong  we didnt even go into an exam room  as your lawyer  i cant stop you from lying i cant even be in the room  but i would be remiss if i didnt prep you until im better  you wrote her a prescription which means there was an examination  what really happened  i was on the phone  dr chase  hi  hi  kayla im here for the test my arm  oh oh yeah umm okay  its positive talk to nurse previn get an appointment with dr broston in rheumatology  i took that medicine you gave me  but my stomach still hurts  bichettes can be stronger than we thought or it could be reflux from the prednisone  this is a stronger antacid  doctor  yes  nothing  you didnt ask her anything about the stomach pain  i made one little mistake  as little mistakes go that was a biggie  shes only advising chase not you  well whats the committee going to do to me  i havent even met this patient  your disdain for human interaction doesnt exculpate you it inculpates you  besides the charts youre responsible for everything chase does  which is why this doesnt matter  she protects chase she protects me  unless her advice to chase is to make a deal and give you up   im so sorry if only dr house had paid attention  hed never even met her he never does  chase loves me and isnt turkish  cameron loves you chase loves his job  you really think stacy hates me that much  i think right now she hates you more than enough  you think emotion only affects doctors judgments  everything stems from that one interaction theyre going to slam you on it  were you distracted your problem  overworked thats their problem  forgetful yours lazy  i just figured the stomach pain was the bichettes  any doctor would have thought the same  then why did you call her an hour after she left the clinic  nurse previn said you asked her to have kayla come back in  the way she hesitated i thought she might have had a doorknob question  patient comes in says hes got a sniffly nose you examine him for 10 minutes right  then youre leaving hand on the doorknob and he says oh yeah and my penis has turned green  embarrassing question only important when patient saves it for last  so you knew she was about to ask the most important question  and you left  no i didnt i figured it out later  what changed  nothing  bad answer  i wasnt thinking clearly at first  worst answer  what was her doorknob question  i figured it might be blood in her stool  which could indicate a bleeding ulcer  talk to me  35yrold female vomiting massive amounts of blood  loc at work bp 80 over 20 heart rate 140  push flows  3 litres in the field and were boosting another one right now  its gotta be a bleeding ulcer doc  coworker says that shes been eating ibuprofens like candy  i thought she had bichettes  1 2 3  chase im in her stomach theres too much blood i cant see  she burst an artery  no there bubbling just a bad ulcer cauterizing   cant see use more saline  hold on  okay   looks good  bleeding ulcer we got it she was fine 2 hours ago   systolic bps 70  house wheres the ulcer  its brown i cauterized it it must be something else  chase there foreman second ulcer  not anymore it perforated  get her to an or  the surgeons were able to suture the perforation  but the contents of the patients   kaylas stomach had spilled into her body  she got septic  then the infection lowers her blood pressure   it damaged her liver and kidneys  listen i know this looks bad i obviously got the diagnosis wrong but i did everything by the book  i couldnt have known what was going to happen  if i skip my coffee i get cranky do you want anything  why did chase screw up  he forgot to ask her a question does there need to be a reason  it might help him  as far as im concerned he made a little mistake it happens  how far are you concerned  you think im biased  youre colleagues youve worked together for over a year  and everyone says you slept together   who says  the correct answer is were not involved and im not biased  were not involved and i dont know why he messed up  house has worked with him longer than i have  you should talk to house  yeah why did chase screw up  because he doesnt give a crap about patients  well he always gets positive patient reviews  yeah he smiles all 84 of his teeth tells them his tonsil story  its a nice story  he still has his tonsils  as soon as hes out of the room  which is as soon as he can be out of the room he starts in on the trash talk  thinks not giving a crap makes him like house like something to aspire to  am i going to have to testify  i wont be encouraging them to call you  whatd house say    two months like this  let me guess no insurance just heard about the free clinic  its a good move  you dont want to skimp on the essentials like wristwatches mp3 players  i need to talk to you  from the doorway   its confidential  cool i love gossip  hear that crackling sound like crumpling up paper  keep listening let me know if it changes  two questions why did chase screw up and how bad was it  wow talk about efficient  i only need one answer chase didnt screw up  he said he did  well im not a lawyer but that seems like a sucky legal strategy  look i dont wanna know what you think a reasonable doctor would have done in chases position  if i thought he was a reasonable doctor i wouldnt have hired him  god you two are a couple of geniuses  deny everything completely fool the lawyer whos trying to help you  too bad the review committee members are actually doctors  stacy    im in her stomach theres too much blood i cant see  she burst an artery  no there bubbling just a bad ulcer  okay cauterizing looks good  bleeding ulcer weve got it she was fine 2 hours ago  if by fine you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of every orifice then yeah i believe you    im guessing those are salvatory bells  systolic bps 70  show me the ulcer  its brown i cauterized it  sweep back show me the whole stomach  stop  foreman second ulcer  not anymore it perforated  get her to an or  lets go  she was not fine  she mentioned stomach pain  yeah so i gave her a stronger  you didnt do an exam  she just came in for a followup the results of the pathogen test  did you listen to her stomach check her vitals  maybe if shed said something about taking ibuprofen mentioned the rectal bleeding  yeah why didnt she go to med school like you did  diarrhoea blood in the stool these are routine questions  doctors skip all the time  it was a minor mistake i couldnt have known it was going to happen  mistakes are as serious as the results they cause  this woman could die because you were too lazy to ask one simple question  no she might die because i had the bad luck to spill your damn vicodin pills  and i responded with a number of  trenchant remarks which made chase cry none of which im going to testify about  unless you convince chase to row on me  excuse me testify about what  uhh  chuck  im going to break from the parable of the wicked doctor and tell a little story about a patient  lets call him  buck who has low o2 stats and crackling lung sounds  like i have  buck has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  his lung tissues turning to rock  theres no known cause no treatment he is slowly suffocating  youre talking about me  lung transplants about a half a million dollars  but this poor suckers got no insurance  if he tried to sign up now hed be excluded preexisting condition  but let me confirm with my lawyer  she confirms  if only buck hadnt been diagnosed with fibrosis before he got insurance  so back to the exam  thats how you tell this guy hes dying  oh relax hes got a cold and soon health insurance  such a hero always righting wrongs  who cares who you have to manipulate  im sorry i didnt realise you and buck were so close  stacy its a point of principle  right its got nothing to do with what i did to you  theres nothing for us to talk about  thats why youre following me i read some notes  if chase screwed up  i was wrong terribly terribly sorry  if chase screwed up so badly why didnt you fire him  he has great hair  what are you hiding  im gay  oh thats not what you meant  it does explain a lot though  no girlfriend always with wilson obsession with sneakers  diarrhoea blood in the stool  two simple questions you could have asked her six months ago and averted this whole thing  you didnt ask either why  judging from your question and your demeanour  i assume you were visiting with house  been over this i dont know   good doctors dont make mistakes  good doctors never forget to ask questions  then youve got your answer apparently im not a good doctor  fyi selfpity generally is not a good strategy in these hearings  what happened after the operation  the kidney damage isnt so bad  the liver damage is more worrisome  theres no dialysis for livers  i know but if she loses her liver she can get a transplant right  we can put her on a list  i could do it  i could give her part of my liver  surgeons wont operate unless the donors had a long time to weigh the decision  theres black markets  those organs thats just  ooh ohhh my stomach    are they constant  ohh oh yeah   sharp or dull  oh i dont know  its bad  its a little cold   appendicitis  no its a clot  nurse call the or weve got to prep her for an embolectomy  oh ohhh  a cvc pt and a liver panel  sepsis had lowered her bp so much she got clots in her liver  they blocked the hepatic artery cut off the blood flow her liver was shocked  did cuddy list her though with all the other problems  forget it we cant give a liver to a woman this sick  do you listen to what youre saying  there is no point in giving a new liver to somebody who also has vasculitis  treatable  and kidney damage  its healing  you know whats really killing her  chase forgot to ask a standard question about stomach pain  so he missed the diagnosis so she perforated so she got sepsis  so her bp tanks so she got blood clots so she lost her liver  livers are important cuddy cant live without them hence the name  and heres the big issue chase is a hospital employee  and kayla is the sympathetic mother of those 2 juryfriendly moppets kayleb and cody  dory and nicky  your point beyond just trying to make chase wet himself seems to be that the hospital faces liability here  well thanks for clearing that up i still need a medical reason to list her  that is a medical reason  the family wins this hospital in a lawsuit theyll turn it into condos  and people will die waiting outside a condo for medical care    start praying for a 12car pileup on the turnpike cause were not exactly swimming in livers over here  when youre testifying skip the details on how house convinced cuddy  i dont think the people who got bumped down the transplant list need to know why  it didnt matter anyway  sam she next on the list  yes  but shes ab negative  very rare  how long can she go on like this  probably another day or two  im donating my liver  sam weve talked about this  im a perfect match  howd you get checked out so fast  i know a guy in medical testing and i paid him to rush it  sam bribed someone to rush his test  wouldnt you  someones going to get the blame for what happened so the more we spread it around  might as well you said no surgeon would do a live donor transplant on such short notice  house took care of that too  your patients hardly clotting  subq vitamin k and fresh frozen plasma preop  pretty risky  well thats why i came to the best transplant surgeon in the hospital  shes dead without you  get her in this afternoon   thank you very much  my pleasure  and this was right before you ran the marathon i suppose  was it the part where he warmly clasped my hands in thanks was that too much  whatd you do to him  the hospital lawyer asks me if i did something unethical  if i did the last person i tell is the hospital lawyer  especially since shes gone all old testament on me  youll tell me  oh ok then  one caveat ive moved past threesomes  im now into foursomes  if someone backs out then youve still got a threesome  if two people back out youre still having sex  youd be amazed even if three people  anything you say is attorneyclient  so you can get advice about the bad bad thing you did  knowing ill be tortured because i cant tell a soul  actually it is kinda cool  are you completely out of your mind  shes dying on her own why would i volunteer to be her executioner  id just be inviting a lawsuit from the brother no matter what  5 grand  and thats just ante money  after the surgery you get another 15  though i warn you that includes the tip    i make 600 grand a year you think im going to risk tanking my percentages for 20 thousand  its tax free  for the record i hope the department takes you and chase  and dropkicks both your asses out the back door  great  that means i dont have to bother welshing on the 15 grand i would have owed you  if you dont do the surgery im going to tell your wife  that youve been sleeping with a series of nurses  currently nurse cuttler in radiology  now whats 600 grand divided by two  last christmas party nurse cuttler handed you one of those little hotdogs  and you didnt thank her  well that only happens when youre very very intimate  that and the fact that youve been practically dancing around with your zipper open  used condom stuck in your shoe  your wife is apparently the only one who doesnt know  there is no way youll tell her  of course i wont im much too cowardly  no id just send an anonymous letter  now ive uh  ive got an or booked for 4 this afternoon  are you free  hmm oh and for the record  you are the worst transplant surgeon in this hospital  but unfortunately youre the only one whos currently cheating on his wife  you bribed him and then you blackmailed him  shed have been dead in 2 days if i hadnt made ayersman do the surgery  leave the blackmail out of the story you tell the committee  tried to leave it out of the story i told you  and then there was that incident in the parking lot  dont do that wait what are you nuts  please i didnt do it i didnt do anything   no  please  apparently someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife  you blackmailed ayersman before he performed the surgery and then you ratted him out anyway  doesnt seem fair does it  you just cant control yourself can you  no matter how stupid how selfdestructive  to make this conversation easier  can we discard the fiction that were talking about anything other than what i did to you  youre not mad because i broke into your psychiatrists office  yeah i was thrilled about that  okay it was a lousy thing to do  but if what id found was that everything was all kittens and moonbeams in markville   youd be over it  no i wouldnt  youre mad at me for letting you know what i did  because you liked where things were going  and for that i actually am sorry  it was stupid  let me tell you a story about a patient  the patient well call fusan  chase because sam had rushed his tests  we were able to get them into surgery that afternoon  dr ayersman performed the live donor transplant  he ressected the right lobe hepatic vein and hepatic artery of sams liver  and transplanted it into kayla the operation was a success  kayla and sam continued to receive routine care  two months later she came by for an exam  july 24th be precise you did the exam   honestly i just wanted to  honestly  so youve been lying up until now  lets make a deal i wont use the word honestly and  youll quit stopping by to see house so you dont take it out on me afterwards  how about that  i wanted to be as far away from kayla as possible  but house was rubbing my nose in it  how are the girls  theyre great  dory had her first crush which was cute  oh yeah  and then her first sort of break up which was not so cute   youre hot 993   you been coughing  no   pain in urinating  no  99s not that high is it  immunosuppressants block fevers you shouldnt have one at all  im sending a nurse in here to draw cultures  and im ordering a chest xray  i wasnt making any more mistakes  another phrase to avoid in front of the committee  she spikes a fever an hour later  her ast and alt are up shes rejecting the liver  no its just an infection one of our cultures is growing a strep  just one probably a contaminant  shes dehydrated her haematocrits way up its strep  transaminases are up too  its just stress from the strep  geez chase you and this strep get a room already  shes not rejecting the liver  its just an infection shell be fine  worst case we could relist her  you house  ummwell that depends are you going to hit  dr house  you havent even seen my sister and youre being cute with me  sam were talking about her right now her fever might  could be hep b hep c right its treatable you give her interferon shes ok  right  you know a lot about hepatitis  he just donated his liver  youre flushed you sick  im tired  youre hiding the fact that youre sick   now why would you do that  hey wait what are you  now either you specifically asked for a tattoo of a heart thats been left out in the sun too long  or that is a really bad home job  its a very common way of getting hep c which you have  youve had it a long time  it was going to keep me from giving my liver  you paid off that lab tech to say you were clean  it hasnt been active in years she was going to die if i  you paid someone off that is totally unethical  get an mri for him and his sister right now  she got hep from me didnt she  no no no no god no  i think she got cancer from you  house was right  brother had an undiagnosed hepatoma that was transplanted with his liver  grew a lot faster in kayla because she was immunosuppressed  how could house have known  hepatitis can cause liver cancer  plus her haematocrit red blood cell count was high  usually means dehydration rare cases  cancer  we probably saved sams life  we were able to operate on him early enough before it metastasized  kayla had already started rejecting the liver  and you couldnt relist her because of the cancer  nothing we could do  this is good  the brother lying about his hep its an intervening act  the proximate cause of her cancer and not your mistake  she would have died six months ago if he hadnt given up his liver  maybe cant prove it   you need to come with me  just been served with papers actually paper one page  defendant princetonplainsborough hospital and dr robert chase  blah blah blah medical malpractice negligence blah blah  youre surprised theyre suing  you think people love chase so much theyre gonna just forgo  punitive damages in the amount of  punitives that means theyre alleging gross negligence  well hes obviously out of his mind  larry wusekus hes not crazy  ooh ive been sued by him  you have been hiding things and lying to me all day  i havent lied about anything  except for the parts that i admitted i was lying about  and im not the one being sued i feel funny   well what havent you told us   before she checked out sam found her a second liver   she had cancer how could she  black market  there was a doctor in mexico city who was going to do the surgery  chase shes leaving from jfk at 5  to meet some mexican guy in the back of a van with a pigs liver and a hacksaw this is nuts  you want to rat me out to house  hell say if theres a chance in a billion then go for it  this is not what she wants  shes being manipulated by a morally guilty brother and a legally guiltier doctor  you think she wants to die  shes dying either way  chase  how many people you know walking around with a black market organ from a third world surgeon huh  foreman this isnt going to be your salvation  its just one more thing theyll pin on you  go in there be the good guy   we need to talk  no theres no time  two minutes  kayla i made a mistake  i wasnt as blunt as i should have been about you all the time  probably didnt want to face it myself  dr chase please dont do this  stress of the travel the operation even then the cancer  kayla we are going  my dad died  lung cancer  i saw him a couple of months before it happened we never talked about it  im sorry your father died but it has nothing  he never even told me he was sick  i wish he had  it wou   youre gonna die alone  thousand of miles from your children you dont want to do that to them  kayla   im sorry sam  kayla you cant give up  if you do this  if you go home  i killed you  no  you gave me 3 months  you gave dory and nicky  and when they found my cancer  they found yours  and i got to save my baby brother    chase a week later kayla died at home  sam was furious  gotta be why thered be a lawsuit  cuddy are you buying this  of course not there was no illegal transplant theres no causation  he was ready to kill me maybe hes lying to his lawyers  or youre lying to us last thursday he saw you for postop care  if you hate your doctor you find another doctor before you find a lawyer  this guy didnt sue cameron or foreman he didnt even sue house  something personal here something you dont want us to know before your hearing  the guy didnt hate you before that meeting he hated you after  so hows everything else the girls  ah you know a lot of crying some nightmares  well be ok though  good  girls are not going to be happy about leaving town though  they love that house the yard their friends  youre moving  ever since the operation ive been on disability  and theres the mortgage so  moving out to stay somewhere cheaper  anyways thanks  i killed your sister  i misdiagnosed her ulcer  killed her  shut up man  she liked you just  i was hungover when she came back to see me  id been up half the night drinking  had a headache and i just wanted to get the hell out of there  couldnt care less what your sister was saying about her stomach pain    may i speak to my future former employee  house great story  you think im lying its exactly what i told him  im sure it is but you lied to him you want him to sue you  i killed his sister  i ordered black coffee this morning and got cream  everybody screws up  they didnt put poison in your coffee  ive seen you hungover  you werent the day you blew his sisters diagnosis  what does it matter why is she less dead if i have a good excuse  if i thought youd screwed up because you were drunk i would have fired you  you knew  you were depressed and distracted  i assumed youd gotten a phone call from your step mom   this is robert  umm  what did he die of  thats impossible  i saw him two months ago if he had lung cancer he would have  dr chase  good news is both your parents are dead now so  no reason to screw up this bad again  howd you know  theres this interconnected network of computers or interweb where you can  how did you know to look   when he visited he told me he only had two months left  when you screwed up i did the math  why didnt you tell me he was dying  he asked me not to  so you just hung me out there to be blindsided  yeah chase it was all my fault  look you got a choice you can either tell the truth  hospital settles family gets some money they get to keep their house  or you can keep up this lie  family gets punitive damages they buy a jet they move to park avenue  and you have to find another career  youre not going to say anything  im going to keep my mouth shut  legally its better for me if you go down in flames  is chase telling the committee about his dad  i dont know  i thought you were going to get him to sell me out   i wouldnt do that  why not  youre my client too  yeah  and thats not going to change unless you leave this job  or i do  so how do you deal with a coworker that you have feelings for positive or negative  i dont want to end up like chase  i dont want to get emotionally caught up and kill you  its not all negative  maybe you were right maybe  maybe that is the problem  so what do we do  i dont know  dr house  after considering the testimonial and documentary evidence  this committee in the matter of kayla mcginley has reached a decision  dr chase  your error resulted in a patients death  you also lied both to your superiors and the patients brother  but taking into account the mitigating factor of your fathers death  weve decided not to revoke your privileges  youll receive one weeks suspension and a letter in your permanent file  now as for dr house  there is no evidence of a failure to supervise that would lead to disciplinary action  and yet there is enough in the record to be very troubled by your conduct  including certain allegations of black mail from members of the transplant team  and by your general refusal to meet with your patients  it should be noted that your patients cancer was diagnosed as the result of a direct physical examination of  not of the patient i met the brother never met her  you want me to go to a family reunion every time i take on a patient  the committee has determined that for no less than one month  dr house will have his practice supervised by another doctor to be designated by dr cuddy  this proceeding is adjourned  did you know this was coming  they contacted me about an hour ago  whats happening to chase  now youre fired  no hes not  dr house meet your new boss
