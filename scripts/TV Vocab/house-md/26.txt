warehouses in your factories   we provide over 10000 doses a year  which is not enough  you know wed love to do more but our hands are tied  new car jerry  i saw it on the way in looks beautiful  dont

airdate fox 1nov2005  selling subscriptions i heard 20 and you get a new bike  dr sebastian charles collapsed during a presentation at stoia tucker  really crushed under the weight of his own ego  wow is there nobody you admire  well there was this gal i met in nam who could blow out a candle without using her  he thinks its tb  good thing hes not the syphilis expert   he wants a second opinion  second to his own  okay its not tb  what is it  oh you want specifics  lemma big knicks fan  youve never had an episode like this before  no he died last month  stupidly tried to share his meds with his cousin  and they only had enough for one  dr house im sebastian charles  patients arent usually part of the diagnostic process  well im a doctor  listen i know you guys dont make a lot of money but  i wrote your people a check last month  oh well write us another one  talk to chase hes rich  my dad not me  every minute 4 people die of tb  wow how can you sleep at night  theres people dying in africa of a disease that we cured over  yeah i know i saw the concert  seriously lets say you sleep six hours that means every night you kill   i guess you gotta get some sleep but come on  if youd stayed up another 10 minutes you could have saved 40 lives  do you send notes to the families in the morning  thats gonna take at least 10 minutes so thats another 40 dead another 40 notes  why dont you go wrack yourself with guilt in your own room  no thanks ill stay id like to hear the differential  dr cameron tell the doctor why its not a good idea for the patient to be here  hes an immunologist and a tb expert  thatll be very useful if we need somebody to say the words   i think its tb     what is that  oh that im sorry thats my body powder  its the only thing ive found that works in the sahara  i im kinda used to it i dont even notice it  who thinks it smells like an elephant dung smoothie   it smells okay to me    that is exactly why the patient shouldnt be in the room  if you cant tell a man that his cologne makes you want to puke  how are you going to tell him that hes an idiot  hes not an idiot  sure you say that now while hes in the room  sebastian look i dont have time for this   its tb  nope  the symptoms are too varied  well if you havent seen 10000 cases id agree thats what youd think  told you hes an idiot  you said you wanted a second opinion  no actually my backers wanted a second opinion  yeah doesnt look good if you drop dead while wearing your shoes sponsors logo  its tb and im not dying im gonna want you to plan a ppd and induce a sputum to confirm the tb  imaging studiesll determine the progress and  i think we should probably take a ct scan of my lungs just so that nobody secondguesses us  wouldnt want that     hello no im feeling much better  well what you can do is you can get your board to approve the increased med shipments that  aha no no no no dont try no no dont do your best  just get it done okay  thats stoia tucker and theyre the nice pharmaceutical company  im sorry but its against hospital regs  oh i need the phone   why dont we focus on getting you better right now   what are you gonna do throw me out  no just the phone  sorry weve got an emergency   theres a phone in your room  yeah i figured that there would be  right i just thought  its not like the hospitals that you might used to in africa  i dont know what the facilities were like  thank you  youre welcome  and thanks for that check   i should go  the nameless poor have a face and its a pompous white man  yeah what a jerk saving all those lives like that  whats the emergency  i cant remember how to do walk the dog  the guys sick he may be dying  weve forgotten all about doing a differential diagnosis  you just sent us off to test him for  i had to get him out of there  now we can all sit around and call him an idiot  who wants to go first  hes right tuberculosis could present in hundreds of different ways  well by that logic everyone in the hospital should be treated  not everyone in the hospitals been exposed to it for the last 20 years  tb takes years to kill you  now hes got a white board full of symptoms  what about something metabolic  welcome aboard the good ship asskisser  nice day for a sail pucker up me hearties  its not metabolic kidney liver and thyroid are all normal no diabetes  what about his heart  obviously big as all outdoors  abnormal heart rhythm white form showed pr variability  its subtle but its there  you think its his heart sick sinus syndrome  loose throttle sometimes beats too fast sometimes too slow  causing him to pass out  it would account for the episode  ill put him on telemetry do a stress test and an echocardiogram  treat him like every other hospital patient  i want to see that pious body powered toosh hanging out of his gown  could you give me a hand with this thing  i dont recall asking for a stress test or an echocardiogram  what are you gonna do walk out  corporate sponsors arent going to like that  i need your forearm  whats house thinking  sick sinus syndrome  well thats a lot more serious than tb  is that a ppd  if it changes color in the next 48 hours  yeah uh if house doesnt think its tb why would he have you test for that  just covering all his bases i guess  uh huh he doesnt seem like a guy who who does that  we have you scheduled for a 1030 echo  good for you   every minute that we refuse to love one another  another puppy cries another tear  youre just mad that hes closer to a nobel prize than you are  and yet ive nailed more swedish babes crazy crazy world  its not just a trip to stockholm you know  it comes with a cash prize  seriously  no wonder everyones going after that peace thing   he cures thousands of people every year you cure what 30  mcdonalds makes a better hamburger than your mother because they make more  oh i see so you hate him because the lives he saves arent as good as the lives you save  yup thats the reason nobel invented dynamite  i wont accept his blood money  the top of my heads killing me  hmmm we spent a week doing top of head in anatomy  i know just where it is  ow that is not the top of my head  eh close enough for clinic your sinuses are clogged  judging by the scratches on your hands im guessing a new cat  it was my mothers shes dead  you keep a dead cat  no my mothers dead  oh poor cat youre allergic  we can control it with antihistamine one pill a day  pills  you dont like to swallow  not surprised forget the pills ill give you a nasal spray  steroids is there something else you can give me  well if you lived by the river ive got a bag  hey stress test was normal  but his ekg was not normal  echos normal  two for you one for me we need a tiebreaker  echo and stress test are more reliable  tilttable test  never works  bet you a weeks clinic duty it does  hah hah youre on  you like this guy  you always tell us our opinion of the patient is irrelevant  medically its irrelevant  that says something about you  you figure that anybody that gives a crap about people in africa must be full of it  yes theres an evolutionary imperative why we give a crap about our family and friends  and theres an evolutionary imperative why we dont give a crap about anybody else  if we loved all people indiscriminately we couldnt function  hmmm so the great humanitarians as selfish as the rest of us  just not as honest about it  you also always tell us motives are irrelevant  dr charles your hearts handling the changes in orientation just fine  no pauses on your ekg  and house drives up for the layup and oh rejected  what does this knobby thing do  im within protocol range youre not going to get a different result  the way i figure it is if this could show you problems at 6  imagine what could happen if you crank it to 10  house is that you  does it go to 11  would you stop you lost im scheduled for clinic duty thursday and friday  all right im beginning to feel nauseous  would you turn the damn thing off before you break it  okay im getting dizzy i cant see im gonna pass out  i win  at those speeds astronauts throw up  im not talking about the nausea  foreman the test revealed a problem  yeah house is insane what he just did  abusive and unprofessional  if he hadnt done it we wouldnt have seen the problem  youve got an abnormal pr interval  it could be dangerous  possibly fatal particularly if youre in africa away from advanced medicine  im gonna need a pacemaker  youre scheduled for surgery this afternoon  youll be able to maintain your pacemaker from anywhere  you just need to get yourself to a phone line every few months  better yet you could join me at one of my clinics  im kind of spoiled  well well get you a hut with a view you like sand  i meant medically   no pet scans no mris  this is ridiculous   dr charles wait  i know i know hospital regulations darling  have a seat come on  youre smart youll adapt we going up or down   basement  all right  you might even find that without the technological crutches you become a better diagnostician  my heart can handle this right  so far just carnival rides have set you off  when you meet these people it changes you  we should talk about it over dinner  are you asking me to africa or on a date  oh i can ask you halfway around the world  i cant ask you to a restaurant a block away  well ones a job and the others  yeah hospital regs you cant date patients right  i wouldnt want to risk your precious objectivity  you havent answered either question by the way  you dont think objectivitys important  i think doctors like house cling to objectivity like a threeyearold to a blanket  dont get too worked up stay calm stay cool and maintain that correct perspective  the only flaw in their argument is when you have millions of people dying  the correct perspective is to be yelling at the top of your lungs   sorry my head is killing me  here sit on the step  so you gonna go out with me or not  your heart rates normal  yeah of course it is its one flight of stairs  im gonna be fine  my hands a little  call a code second floor stairwell  you were wrong  hey i have feelings im trying my best isnt that enough for you   the abnormal ekg was real  its not sick sinus syndrome  well thank god we found out before we put the pacemaker in  and thank god you dragged him into a stairwell to get his heart racing  we were taking the stairs they keep them in the stairwell  the guys a selfish jerk why would you  why would you say hes selfish  because hes been talking to foreman  no i havent im just giving my opinion  this kind of altruism doesnt just naturally   excellent briefing  hey the guys still sick can we talk about that  the headaches point to a neurological problem acoustic neuroma  brian tumor causes dizziness loss of consciousness  messes with breathing patterns heart rhythms  get an mri  hello oh im sorry ill be right down  no problem ill do an extra hour to make up  im late for my clinic duty here go be me for a couple hours  explosive diarrhea fever its probably the flu  wow youre good you a harvard boy  youre not hale oliver  no carter cecelia  they put you in the wrong room cecelia  mrs carter  sorry ill just be a few minutes dont take these in order and everything falls apart  i have cancer  i felt a lump   ill go get a nurse  yeah see you in an hour or two  lie flat  lift your left arm up and under your head  right there  yeah i felt it this morning  oh my cousin had the same thing  its nothing we should check it again on your next cycle but  you really dont have anything to worry about  thats what they told donna she was dead in six months  listen the edges are smooth it has mobility it has all the earmarks of a benign  why should i believe you  because youre trying to rush me out of here  the risks of a false positive on a biopsy outweigh  either you do the biopsy or i talk to your superior  which is itdr house  ill arrange the biopsy  thanks  he asked me out  im shocked  im shocked when patients dont ask you out  he also asked me to come to africa  boy he moves fast  i think the two questions had two different objectives  well do you like him  good looking single guy genius doctor cares about the world  i take it you said no  you think im that hung up on rules and  hes not house theres nothing there  yeah there is   did i ask you to plant a ppd  it was positive hes got tb  well of course hes got tb the guys been in the jungle for 20 years  if he tested positive for pinkeye would you think that was his big problem  i did a test it was positive why is that a problem  because now hes got the big red target on his arm the stubborn jerk thinks hes right  he wont let us do any more tests  well maybe hes not the only stubborn jerk  i did an lp2 low glucose and he has an increased sed rate   everything screams tuberculosis  not everything  if any of the symptoms are caused by the tb it would throw off our diagnosis  youre right gotta treat the tb  who knows maybe hell just get better  youd like that wouldnt you  so its tb but not tb  im complicated  the guy does know tuberculosis if he says it can manifest itself  hes not even a real doctor hes a human telethon  is that your problem with him  you see hypocrites every day why is this guy so special  you think i have a hypocritical attitude to hypocrisy  the problem is there are 26 letters in the alphabet and he only uses two of them  he treats thousands of patients with one diagnosis  he knows the answer going in its cheating  so its all because hes one of them useless specialists  oh did i hurt the big time oncologists itty bitty feelings  youre a big help to patients who actually have cancer  other times youre just annoying  youve outdone yourself  ill say my salads covering a free tbone steak  cecelia carter remember her  last week they said it was mystery stew they owe me  she was just in my office crying because of the way you treated her  that doesnt sound like you  then it probably wasnt  i get that you like to shock people  stun them out of complacency out of stupidity  but this woman thought she had cancer she had a lump in her breast  what were you trying to accomplish  let me ask you something if this were another doctor  if this patient were complaining about lets say  i dont know foreman  youd just dismiss this as the paranoid bitching of another paranoid bitch and file it under p for  paranoid  am not   youre right  good  apologize to her before the end of business today   what did you do to ceci  i have no idea  just a salad today big breakfast  hey  levofloxacin  you have a resistant strain of tb  wow you just walk right in with these  thats what we doctors do  we write down the name of some medicine and someone gives it to us  you know theres parts of the world where you get knifed walking around with this  i mean regular stuffs bad enough but  treatment for the resistant strain   i could get 6 a tablet for that one  and id take it for two years  streptomycin now thats two grand  ten grand cure one person  i had a patient in jani once  it was a mother had had three little boys  she had resistant tb  she couldnt afford these she couldnt afford bread  we gave her the regular stuff but  no surprise she died  im sorry  im not taking these pills  because she couldnt get them youre not going to take them  thats insane  why because im better than her  because letting her die was wrong but letting you die is just as wrong  well maybe i wont die  maybe somebodyll pay a little more attention to my story  he figures the pharmaceuticals need something big to force them into action   thisll get a lot more media play than a thousand african villagers dying  so he wont take the pills  newsweeks calling you  and he wont agree to any more tests  he has his diagnosis  see what happens when you dont listen to me   maybe millions of lives get saved  yeah thats my point  increased heart rate night sweats loss of consciousness besides rough sex  what do they all have in common   t  its not tb   his autonomic nervous system  we know that its not a brain tumor  so what else could be eating his nerves  fabrys autonomic disregulation syndrome shydrager syndrome it doesnt matter  he wont let us test him     in my opinion dr sebastian charles is an idiot  yeah you can quote me  cuddy    sebastian is refusing lifesaving treatment  hes refusing tb treatment you dont think he has tb ergo you should care less  he wont let me test him  and what do you want me to do about it  hold him down  have you apologized to cecelia carter yet  trust me she doesnt want to hear it from me  look the guy is killing himself  am i the only one who realizes this is a bad thing  if he was a christian scientist refusing meds wed have 18 attorneys  youre putting on makeup  thats not a good sign for my side is it  sebastian has called a press conference for 3  hes asked me to be there to confirm the diagnosis on the prognosis  you are as big a media whore as he is  of course i am it couldnt possibly be that i think hes right  and id like to be a small part of what hes doing  oh whores can like the sex doesnt mean theyre not whores  and with that eyeshadow  i am totally screwed arent i  totally  howre you feeling  a little weak  youre having a good day  the symptoms will quickly focus more and more on your lungs  youll find it difficult to talk and eventually breathe at all  i think i know what i have to look forward to  i know  i just came to ask if youd be willing to accept any treatment  naw if youre trying to scare me into any  no palliative treatment  narcotics fentanyl patch morphine drip whatever it takes  we can make your last days fairly comfortable  and if you have another good day maybe dinner  hmm  thank you  you want thirdworld treatment  you got it  boy is it hot here in jani   what are you doing  what am i doing  putting everything on the floor of the hut  uh oh wicked magic box with the moving pictures  you think hes a hypocrite  hypocrite no everyone in africas got cell phones or running water  hah this thing just will not flush  do you really think that if you come in here and make it a little hot  make it smell a little that im just going to fold and abandon everything that matters to me  lousy sanitation over there too  you are not the same as them your life is not the same  and you are cheapening everything theyre going through by pretending you are  i am the same im not special  you cant demand to be treated like any thirdworld sick person and call a press conference  they treat me special that doesnt mean i am  now what kind of selfish jerk wouldnt take advantage of that fact  its all preventable  stoia tucker makes medications right here  in new jersey they have warehouses full of the stuff  theres more than enough to go around  so if i can get them why cant lemma  why cant quesmo  and why cant sarni    another person just died  where is your outrage     no i have no intention of martyring myself im just putting myself   sure theyre dying but its got a great beat  must be hot as hell under those lights  yup  hey why the page he okay  hes in a coma  i need you to apologize to ceci cecily  mrs carter for what   for whatever i did  you didnt do anything  that has been my position all along   xrays are negative so hes not contagious at this point his conditions currently stable  dyou notice how all the selfsacrificing women in history  joan of arc mother theresa cant think of any others  they all die alone the men on the other hand get so much fuzz its crazy  its an unfair world  house she was scared and unreasonable  insulting a woman with breast cancer thats a move best left to the pros  frankly you dont have the chops  i didnt insult her  i did the unnecessary biopsy like she wanted  it was negative like i knew it would be  what did you do call em perky  you are years away from mad skills like that  i need you to apologize  you know cuddys only doing this because she thinks its you  welcome to the world  everyones different everyone gets treated different  you try fighting that you end up dying of tb  what are you doing  testing the patients autonomic nervous system  of course  his internal heating and ventilation should be off  shouldnt be able to sweat  thats why hes got that awful body powder  take it away crank up the heat stick him under the lights  cant cool himself he should be turning bright red  the pictures fine  im asking stoia tucker to save these lives millions of lives  including my own  dr house i would appreciate it if you left us alone  get that out of my face  cuddy what are you trying to prove house  dr house i would appreciate it if you left the room  hes sweating like a pig  its a hundred degrees in here house because you turned up the thermostat  did they hear me the media did they listen  hes disoriented  they they have to hear me  his arteries are clamping down   i want everybody out of here now  get the crash cart hes having a cardiac arrest    cuddy get them out  everyone i want everyone out of here now  clear  come on sebastian clear  ive got sinus rhythm  that is not tv  compelling television  do whatever tests you want  i want to treat you for tb  dr cameron found low sugar in your cerebrospinal fluid  its a classic finding of tb  and now you think tbs the problem  nah tb caused cardiac arrest on a hot day  your work in africa would be even more futile than it already is  can you get to your point please  that white board in my office  were up to about a dozen symptoms now  cardiac arrest clearly not tb csf sugar clearly is tb  the rest of them could go either way  unless we know which ones are which i cant diagnose you  ill take any other tests or treatments you might want to prescribe  so youre not special but tb is  people die of tb because we let them its our choice  people die of malaria because we let them they die of dysentery  nah tbs my disease  you own a disease  well im sorry i missed the ipo on dengue fever  look i know i have a way about me  i know i piss a lot of people off and a whole lot more i just annoy  but youre the first person that ive ever met who i think is actually annoyed by what i do  do you think im not saving any lives or is that a bad thing  right now im just trying to save your life  or do you just have a problem with hope  you know the difference between our jobs is not numbers or styles  its that i know im gonna fail  even if i save a million people theres gonna be another million  you couldnt handle that  i think you resent anyone who can  cant we just agree that youre incredibly annoying  take the pills or i let you die do an autopsy call my own press conference  and make sure the world knows that you didnt die of tb  corporate sponsors will be disappointed but theyll find another disease  why would you do that  because im just a mean son of a bitch  so we still have to explain pr variability syncope headaches  andlow sugar   that was classic tb  apparently not  cameron youve rerun the test chase yeah  this is good  good this is bizarre  bizarre is good  common has hundreds of explanations bizarre has hardly any  what else could cause low csf sugar  uhuh i get to ask the questions  ive found you look a lot smarter asking the questions than dumbly not answering   high insulin levels in his blood  theyd have to be very high  chase okay very high insulin levels in his blood  how could he get high insulin levels  weve checked daily blood sugars all normal  see how smart she looks cause she asked the question  and its not glucagonoma because he has no rash  its not selfinduced because hes not an idiot  and its not a tumor because the ct and the mri were both negative  which just leaves tumor  why do you do this  why do you ignore what i say like im not even  small tumor really really tiny  so small we cant see it nesidioblastoma  an abnormal growth of the insulinsecreting glands of his pancreas  it only intermittently secretes insulin  it responds to stress like if oh i dont know  if someone accidentally puts the mechanical bull on 11  easily removed by surgery  except if its so small we cant see it  howre we even going to prove its there  she asked looking clever  we just start hacking away at his pancreas until he gets better  how do you prove something exists when you cant see it  does god exist does the wind blow  we know because the leaves move   look for effects  uh we should look the other way its cuddy with your patient  cuddy dr house  dr house has an emergency   we cant avoid her forever  eventually shell die  you sure she doesnt have breast cancer  house we think you have a tumor easily removed surgically  were going to poke it with a stick  and if theres no tumor  nothing happens  splenic artery its a hard left off the celiac  if there is a tumor  what usually happens when you poke something with a stick it pokes back  hes stuck in the superior mesenteric  i knew we should have stopped for directions men  im there  were going to inject calcium into your pancreas  the beta cells will release insulin  if there are too many beta cells because of a tumor  your blood sugar will drop precipitously  how do we know it wont go too low  fingers and toes crossed  go ahead  glucose is holding steady at 75  no leaves rustling blow harder  i already gave him 1 amp  well i guess now would be the time to give him more than 1 amp  cameron   i think my arms shaking  im gonna start him on a glucose drip hes gonna seize  not yet  foreman hes continuing to drop  house not fast enough   hes seizing  weve got to reverse this  cameron hes at 40 38 35    push an amp of d50 you want to kill the guy  were back to 40  congratulations you have a tumor    are you gonna go out with him  is that any of your business  nope  i dont think so  two days ago you were holding his hand whats changed  he practically lives in africa theres no future  on the other hand maybe theres too much of a future now  you werent attracted to him because he was prepared to die for a cause  you were attracted to him because he was actually doing it  right its that simple  that was simple  i put a label on them and go from there  everybody does it  we are who people think we are  people think hes a great doctor so they give him stuff  he is a great doctor  the reality is irrelevant  ill prove it  people who know me see me as an ass treat me as an ass  people who dont know me see a cripple treat me as a cripple  what kind of selfish jerk wouldnt take advantage of that fact  ow  oh my goodness are you okay  yeah  i am so sorry it was completely my fault  its nothing im fine  well im very relieved i feel terrible  dont worry about it im fine   you sure  mmm  okay  hows everything  im gonna go my foots killing me   oh what did you do  it was nothing it was all my fault   yeah listen fugawi relax im gonna be back on tuesday  tell sarni im gonna bring her a new brace all right  just in case  you get em  six month supply should fix you right up  i see you when you come back for a refill  yeah ill see you in two months  youre gonna give them away  well you know how these things happen you leave a bag in the airplane  drop some pills down the drain  i have an idea you could bring me the refill in africa  i dont think so  you actually like working for house you find this satisfying     how many days has it been since i was born    how many days until i die   why    do i know any way that i can make you laugh   thank you thank you i appreciate that i appreciate the support  its not about the kids dying every 8 seconds  its about the media stroking  adulation and pats on the head  thats your problem with him isnt it  look at him he loves it eats it up  yeah the man actually enjoys what he does  listen i saved his life  that means i get credit for every life he saves from here on out  ill make sure stockholm knows
