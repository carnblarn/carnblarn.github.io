                he is not sick  dr riley is throwing up he obviously cant lecture  you witnessed the spew or you just have his word for it  i think im coming down with a little bit of the clap i may have to go home for a few days  dr riley doesnt have a history of lying to me  you said this is the fifth time hes missed a class this year   either hes dying or hes lying  ill give you two hours off clinic duty  fine ill have cameron do it she loves inspiring the inspired   youll do it  why is it always me  because the world hates you or because its a class on diagnostics  pick whichever reason feeds your narcissism better  im not doing it  youre supposed to stop me renegotiate  and you were supposed to keep on walking  sorry guess we both screwed up go on do it again  ill do the lecture for four hours off clinic  two i know youd rather spend a couple of hours  listening to yourself than listening to patients     class starts in 20 minutes   dr house theres a patient  im outta here take it up with cuddy   greg  hi stacy  how ya doin  how am i doing  the last five years have been like  you ever see those girls gone wild videos  your lifes been like that or your lifes been spent watching them  i have missed you  is that why youre here    i need your help  who am i looking at my husband  who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells  no sign of tumors no vasculitis  could be indigestion  or maybe a kidney stone little one can pack a lot of wallop  did you think i wasnt going to get married   not to someone so poorly endowed  this guys pancreas is pathetic  there is no kidney stone no indigestion  three hospitals five doctors not one of them found anything  maybe theres nothing to be found  right you suddenly trust doctors love puppies and long walks in the rain  walks are out  i was around you long enough to know when somethings not right  marks had personality changes hes acting strange disconnected  interesting  means theres either a neurological component or hes having an affair  no affair no nothing hes sick  i know youre not too busy you avoid work like the plague  unless it actually is the plague  im asking you a favor im not too busy  but im not sure i want him to live  its good seeing you again  three guys walk into a clinic  their legs hurt whats wrong with them  im not gonna like you am i  the most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain  apply heat and rest affected areas  statistically youre right very good  my experience over half ofleg pain is musculoskeletal  generally from excessive exercise  twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy  and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents  i said three people thats six legs  so youve got three hurt jogging two in collisions and one of the legs is pregnant     what were they doing when pain presented   i have no idea  you didnt ask you didnt take a history  of course but all that told us is what they said happened  person a farmer says he was fixing a fence    tightness in the ankle loss of muscle control   person b volleyball practice       coach figured it was a pulled muscle  and c weve got carmen electra golfing   yes  whoa you treated the baywatch chick  the baywatch thespian and no  i gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients  and i got tired of using the middleaged man  carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative  also shes apparently quite the golfer  in less than two hours one of these three  will be tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics  and one will be very close to death  any guesses on which is which  okay i say we start with the farmer  did you hike to the fence and how far  yes its about a half a mile from my farmhouse  where is the pain localized  it started just above my ankle and its radiating up  so what should we do first  family history  indicative of leg pain thats a very short list  any history of bone cancer osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma  could be a blood issue  we should run a cbc and a ddimer and get an mri  mri or a pet scan if the problems vascular hes better off   sorry thanks for playin patients dead you killed him  we had no time to run any tests there was nothing we could do  you had time to look at the leg  i thought we were starting with the farmers case first  we are but if were gonna look at a leg  i need you to take off your pants  puncture   snakebite that would be my guess  farmer didnt know hed been bitten by a snake thats what he said  sudden shooting pain tall grass never saw a thing   what kind of snake  you want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg  how are we to know what kind of antivenom to use if we dont know what kind of snake it is  oh there are people to find those things out  shouldnt we wait for the humane society or something   guy might only have a couple of hours    and while we wait for the humane society to show up  what say we check in on the volleyball player  you have tendinitis   how old is this person  i mean its not really a 40yearold man on a girls volleyball team right  its a leg a leg is a leg is a leg   well i was just worried that  would you worry about her more if she was younger  obviously we should care about all our patients no matter what age  yeah right i saw the way you were looking at carmen  shes mine stay away   would you operate on your mother  of course not  id be too nervous couldnt be objective  then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like theyre family  the actual patient is 16  heres what happens when doctors care too much  i need to know everything about you   i went back three generations  no history of cancer parkinsons or any other degenerative condition  but theres this boy at school and hes on the boys volleyball team  they made out at a party and now he wont call her back  and this friend of hers at school said this boy didnt like her and never did  you got all this from an examination of the knee  i think shes depressed she doesnt have tendinitis  she has tendinitis shes depressed about having tendinitis  shes depressed for the same reason that she has tendinitis not the boy  no the boys a jerk she knows that and yet shes depressed  i found a nodule  ahh problems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state  can cause inflammation of the tendons  ill run the tests   so because she took such an extreme interest  she found out that the person had a thyroid condition  no because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule  which in reality signified nothing but gave us no choice  but to put a person with tendinitis through an expensive and painful test    heres how a welladjusted doctor handles a case  can i put my pants back on now id rather you didnt  which carmen electra is this  the first one the golfer  then why isnt she wearing pants  you have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon   anyone  slipped disc  could be how bad does it hurt   it hurts really really bad  yeah  it doesnt seem real is she the one faking  oh for gods sake shes here to play into my fantasy not cause shes meryl streep  fine  what the hell is wrong with me  do something   too much pain to be a slipped disc could be herniated and impinging the nerve root  or it could be referred pain from his groin  sir are you getting pain anywhere else    hes curling its not the back  sir where are you getting pain   help me  hes not gonna tell us anything if we dont get him out of pain   give him 50 milligrams of demerol  we have no history he could be allergic   what do i do  we cant diagnose him while he screams  better than killing him with painkillers that      apparently hes not allergic  thank you i feel a lot better now  we screwed up  no you did exactly what his attending did  and that was the proper way to handle the case yeah  the guy used him as a dealer  youre gonna see a lot of drugseeking behavior in your practice  theres a reason it works  meanwhile back on the farm    yeah timber rattlesnake  four vials of the crofab antivenom   hey how ya doin  all right  thank you this will start making you feel better really fast    hes having an allergic reaction bag   paddles and epi  his hearts fine its not gonna stay that way     paddles  what say we take five  get some coffee go pee  you didnt think she was gonna get married  she asked me the same question  and what youre not gonna treat him  theres probably nothing wrong with him  oh sure that makes sense shes just using the old sick husband routine  as an excuse to get back in touch with you  you think this is easy for her  the only reason shed be anywhere near you is if she was desperate  so i should help her because she hates me  she doesnt hate you she loves you  she just cant stand to be around you  uh dr house  its been almost six minutes     found him  the volleyball player  was responding to the antiinflammatories as youd expect in a case of tendinitis  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what about the snakebite guy  i dont really care about the volleyball player  what if i told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke   really  no  but that would make you interested right what if her t4 came back low  its not quite as interesting but it has the benefit ofbeing true  you said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test  no i didnt i said she put a person with tendinitis through an expensive and painful test  apparently the patient had tendinitis and a thyroid condition  were gonna start you on thyroxine itll make you feel better and level your moods  thank you   so thats it  you were right the first time  snakebite guys way more interesting gross actually   the patient responded to epinephrine and the allergic reaction was arrested  unfortunately the patient continues to deteriorate  maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type we caught  he faxed us the venom test confirmed its a timber rattlesnake  no its not notice the volume  i skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring jumped right to the name of the snake  two hundred milligrams our guy got bit less than four hours ago  theres no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly   were supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom  no  unless youve got a patient bit by one then it might be helpful so what do we do now  he must have been bitten by a different snake we go back and find it  or you go online and you find theres only three poisonous snakes common in new jersey  the copperhead timber rattler and the coral  copperhead and timber rattler both respond to the antivenoms we gave the guy   so we give him the antivenom for the other one  is that a question  we cant just blindly give him another antivenom especially after the first one almost killed him  you said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in new jersey   well what if this is an uncommon one  very good   we gotta find the right snake  no need  odds are by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was   but you said  so we do give him the antivenom for the other one  again was that a question i asked what you would do  it seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do  who gives the guy the other antivenom  and who goes looking for the snake  i assume that one choice kills him the other one saves him  thats usually the way it works at the legturningblack stage  so half of us killed him and half of us saved his life   yeah  we cant be blamed for  im sure this goes against everything youve been taught but right and wrong do exist  just because you dont know what the right answer is  maybe theres even no way you could know what the right answer is  doesnt make your answer right or even okay  its much simpler than that its just plain wrong   we gave the guy the antivenom what if im allergic again  thats why these people are here  if you have a reaction were ready to do whatevers necessary  to ensure your airways stay open and your heart keeps beating  my wifes on her way in cant this wait  im sorry it cant  it hurts again  he came back  on average drug addicts are stupid   id call the cops  good for you  a lot of doctors wouldnt risk their careers on a hunch  its not a hunch i mean i know he wants drugs  well even drug addicts get sick  actually for some reason they tend to get sick more often than nondrug addicts  luckily you dont have to play your hunch  theres a faster way actually there are several  my preference is urine testing   but you already know he has drugs in his system  thats not what im testing for  were gonna put this hard rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder   it may be a little uncomfortable  shouldnt i be getting some sort of anesthetic   were concerned about allergic reactions today    if the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour hes really sick  or hes really jonesing  theres easier ways to get ahold of drugs  other hospitals for example   the volleyball player is not responding to treatment  at least we think its not working  on account of the fact that shes getting worse    can you still hear me  no  a little not really   well if you cant hear me how do you know what i asked   ow  im sorry what did i do  i dont know it really hurts i promise to be very careful   susan  not her real name   susan i barely touched you    it hurts so much im sorry i have to get this blood just hold on  hypersensitivity to touch    her calcium up  lab over 16   question is why likely suspects  parathyroid adenoma   kidney problems  vit d intoxication  hyperthyroid   caused by our treatment  whoa whoa  can you please slow down    the adenoma is most likely  check her p th phosphorus  and ionized calcium  and do a technetium sestamibi  okay thats enough about the volleyball player   whats up with the farmer  what farmer  snakebite guy  oh right you guys dont know about him  he doesnt get bitten until three months after we treat the volleyball player  luckily its been well established that time is not a fixed construct  his condition is not improving double the dosage   already did  theres another antivenom   its not as effective but  already tried it   the first stuff the stuff he was allergic to  gave it to him with highdose steroids   nothings working  what does it all mean   wrong snake  we tried every other antivenom we had   were too late  yep hes dying his wifes here  finally found a babysitter who wants to let em know   actually im kidding  hes not dying  oh yeah hes dying but theres no wife and kid  which is great  makes the breakingthenews thing way easier  oh yeah one more piece of news    the drug addict is peeing blood  how do they teach you how to tell someone that theyre dying  its kind of like teaching architects how to explain why their building fell down  do you roleplay and stuff  yeah one of us gives the bad news and one of us gets the bad news  what do you have to do to get an a in youre dying 101  they grade you on gentleness and supportiveness  is there a scale for measuring compassion  this buddy of mine  i gotta give him 10 bucks every time someone says thank you  imagine that this guys so good  people thank him for telling em that theyre dying  needs brown  i dont get thanked that often  youre dying  in a few hours  theres nothing we can do except deal with the pain  well i need to go home  youre not going home  but my dog what will happen to my dog  her neck looks clean no adenoma  wait wait wait the guys dying and all he cares about is his dog   any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions  its a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies  the only variable is about what  the great thing about telling someone theyre dying  is that it tends to focus their priorities  you find out what matters to them  what theyre willing to die for  what theyre willing to lie for  you must have a neighbor who neighbors dont like him  so the humane society will take him in and find him a home no they wont   yeah but maybe my aunt  it wasnt a snakebite was it  i said i dont remember bein bit  sure you do just not by a snake  i assume that cujo bit one of your neighbors a while back  you tell me that he bit you and i gotta report it  cujos got a record he gets the chair  the good news is you might just live the bad news is your dogs gonna die     guy risked his life to save this thing    ill hold him you swab the mouth  i think ive got a better grip here you go for the mouth   all right im odds  you serious one two three  damn  i dont care if hes scratching your nads off you dont let go  just do it  i say we let the guy die   i got his head just do it  got it  what would you call that  its teacolored right  the guy we thought was just after the drugs  whats the differential diagnosis for urine thats teacolored   kidney stone  kidney stones would cause what   blood in urine  what color is your pee   yellow  what color is your blood   red  what colors did i use  red yellow and brown   and brown what causes brown  waste   which means the kidneys are shutting down why  trauma   none that his history would indicate  could be damage done by the selfinjection of the demerol   treatment  heat and rest   other possible causes  infection  start him on antibiotics what else  come on come on li dont know  youre useless but at least you know it  blood tests show elevated creatine kinase   what does that tell you  the trauma diagnosis was right   he takes it easy for a few days hell be fine  you sure   the elevated ck rules out infection  you know whats worse than useless  useless and oblivious  what are they missing  its kind of hard to think when youre in our face like  yeah you think its gonna be easier when you got a real patient really dying  what are you missing   muscle death   not your case  nothing wrong with a consult  dying muscle leaks myoglobin its toxic to the kidneys  brilliant   mri his leg see whats killing it   why is the girl getting the mri  because the neck scan revealed nothing  and her doctors way more obsessive than she thinks she is   but you said the guy needed the mri  because dr cameron back there said muscle death  not one of you said it not one of this guys doctors said it  they gave him bed rest and antibiotics just like you guys would have   did he get better  no   how long  three days  it is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up  you are gonna kill someone  if you cant handle that reality pick another profession  or finish medical school and teach  three days before they thought it might have been muscle death  no three days before the patient suggested it might have been muscle death  the mri revealed an osteosarcoma  a cancerous tumor on your femur it needs to be removed surgically  with chemo she has an excellent chance of survival  but i have to warn you depending on how large the tumor is and how ingrained it is  the surgeon may need to amputate your leg  im sorry   its okay  dogs mouths are pretty filthy  but they have natural antibodies to fight off most of the stuff  we dont thats why dog bites can be so nasty  lab tests of your dogs saliva revealed a type of strep bacteria  its commonly known as the flesheating disease  we need to operate immediately to remove the damaged tissue  we may need to remove the leg  the mri revealed a problem no kidding  im sorry none of your doctors found it earlier  i am personally gonna oversee your treatment from now on youre gonna cut me open arent you  we may need to remove the leg  his mri showed that the leg pain wasnt caused by the selfinjection  it wasnt caused by an infection  it was an aneurysm that clotted  leading to an infarction  my god you were right its house   we have to do the surgery  the necrotic tissue has to be removed if theres too much  i dont care what you find  it may become necessary in order to save your life  i like my leg  ive had it for as long as i can remember  greg i love your leg as much as you do theyre not cutting it off  the patient made the right choice  tell a surgeon that its okay to cut a leg off  and hes gonna spend the night polishing his good hacksaw  right surgeons could care less about saving limbs  of course they care about their patients they just care about themselves more  which is not an unreasonable position  trying to maximize the tissue you save  also maximizes the chances of something going wrong  which means youve gotta be extra careful which is such a pain in the ass  amazing advances have been made kids with prosthetic legs  are running the hundredmeter dash in 12 seconds  yeah theyre just not as pretty  do a bypass restore the circulation   amputation is safer  for you or me   the blockage of blood flow  fourday blockage  yes it caused muscle cell death  when those cells die they release cytokines and potassium  and if you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off  then all that crap gets washed back into my system  the cytokines could cause organ failure the potassium could cause cardiac arrest  on the other hand i may just get the use of my leg back  the postoperative pain alone will ill get through it  i understand the risks youre in the clear go schedule an or   god youre an idiot  i think im more of a jerk  im not being glib and im not being cute  i dont want you to kill yourself  im not gonna die  oh i feel completely reassured  more suction        inserting now     they gotta up the morphine   doctors say they cant  doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics   they screwed up it doesnt mean theyre wrong this time  sure doesnt mean theyre right   morphine will kill you  i can handle it   youre in pain youre not thinking right  thats why i need the damn morphine   ill talk to them    oh my god how much longer is the pain gonna last  it depends on how much muscle cell death there was  he could be right he could come out of this with almost full use of his leg  or  he could be in pain for the rest of his life  theres a third option surgically  a middle ground between what we did and amputation  hes not big on middle ground  yeah    nurse nurse   i need more calcium gluconate  you just had five mis  the q rs is getting wider my potassium is rising   ill talk to your doctor  well you better make it fast  cause im about to go into cardiac arrest  you give me the dose or i go into wide complex tachycardia   i could get in trouble  listen its not a narcotic  im not looking for a buzz you got about 20 seconds         i was wrong    what do you got wide complex tachycardia  you diagnosed he did  defibrillator paddles  charge clear    the patient was technically dead for over a minute         hes back   do you think he was dead  do you think those experiences were real  define real they were real experiences  what they meant  personally i choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see  the visions this patient saw  theyre all just chemical reactions that take place while the brain shuts down   you choose to believe that  theres no conclusive science  my choice has no practical relevance to my life  i choose the outcome i find more comforting  you find it more comforting to believe that this is it  lfind it more comforting to believe that this isnt simply a test     how bad is the pain right now   its bad  its not getting any better if you were right the pain would be subsiding  youd be getting better its just taking longer  no its not  weve gotta let em cut the leg off  its my leg its my life  would you give up your leg to save my life  of course i would  why do you think your life is worth less than mine  if this were any other patient what would you tell them to do  i would say its their choice  not a chance  youd browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right  youd shove it in their face that its just a damn leg  you dont think you deserve to live  you dont think you deserve to be happy  now let them cut off your leg   i cant i cant  im sorry  the pain alone is gonna kill you  i know i know  i need you to talk to the doctor  he change his mind  no  hes asked to be put in a chemically induced coma  so that he can sleep through the worst part of the pain  we can do that  what happens after hes in the coma  well obviously monitor his condition closely  and if he can get through the next 48 hours without another cardiac incident  i meant im his health care proxy i get to make medical decisions for him if hes not able to  you should talk to him about what he wants to do  i know what he wants but if hes out its my call right    youll be out in less than a minute  thank you   hey  hey  ill see you when i wake up   well go golfing    i love you  i love you too  im sorry  youve got nothing to be sorry about    the middle ground you were talking about  we go in take out the dead muscle  theres still some risk of reperfusion injury but  give me the forms you need signed  youre saving his life  he wont see it that way      because of the extent of the muscle removed  the utility of the patients leg was severely compromised  because of the time delay in making the diagnosis  the patient continues to experience chronic pain   she had no right to do that   she had the proxy  she knew he didnt want the surgery   she saved his life  we dont know that maybe he wouldve been fine   it doesnt matter its the patients call  the patients an idiot  they usually are  do you have a buzzer or something what time does this class end  twenty minutes ago  im not doing this again  and this guy is not the worlds greatest dad not even ranked  who the hell lets their kids play with leadbased paint thats why hes always sick  find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again    stacy its greg  ive got an opening in my calendar for 1000 tomorrow morning  make sure your husband isnt late    thats some bad hat harry
