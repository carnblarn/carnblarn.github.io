                clancy mom  im thirsty  i just gave you water  i want juice  its bedtime  close your eyes and go to sleep  mom  door opens  what do you want clance  oh hi dad  sighs go to bed  can i turn the tv on  tvs only for the daytime that was the deal  ill keep the volume down i just like the light  go to bed  dad what if  what if they come to get me again  nobody is coming to get you okay go to bed now  door closes  static crackling  gasps  screaming  come on clancy its time to get up  woman on tv if you plan to be out at the shore today you are in for a treat  were looking at mostly sunny skies up and down the jersey coast  i guess hes already up  thats a first  well ill see if he needs breakfast  todd hey clance you hungry  hon hes not down here  you sure  clancy  clancy  clancy where are you  sweetie are you hiding clancy  where is he  clancy  clancy  todd youre gonna be in big trouble when i find you  honey come out right now wherever you are this is not funny  todd clance  stephanie clancy  people chattering  exclaims  wheres the sweat and the bo  youve taken such pride in bathing us all in your musk  i showered at home  and yet youre earlier than usual  is this an intervention  its a little late since im not using drugs anymore  i am however still hooked on phonics  if you did your morning run and showered at home  youd be later than usual  thought of you in the shower  hows your leg you seem to be favoring your left side  i was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday  makes all the difference in the world  youve taken the stairs every day  do i need a restraining order  you slack on your rehab  the muscle will weaken and your leg will hurt again  looks like the ketamine treatment might not stick  or maybe weve made him depressed because were lying to him  telling him he got that case wrong  we didnt hurt him the pain isnt  he gets depressed he stops exercising  he stops exercising the muscle atrophies  the muscle atrophies the pain returns  maybe he stopped exercising because the giant hole in his leg actually hurts  the ketamine could work perfectly  and he would still be back on his cane popping vicodin again  you cant tell him he got lucky there was no medical  he was right  we tell him he was right and were feeding his addiction  without vicodin hes only got one to focus on  well hes not gonna od on puzzles  no its not gonna hurt him  but he could just as easily have killed that patient  we have a tiny window of time here where house may be healthy enough to change  and based on that limp the windows closing fast  kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy  had all his vaccinations fractured his right ulna at age three  chicken pox at age five  he ever get his feelings hurt  ill need to know that too  you are 0 for one since you came back we just wanna make sure that  rectal bleeding plus alienabduction fantasies  most likely sexual abuse  penetration causes the bleed trauma causes the fantasy  er ran a rape kit found no evidence of tearing semen or pubic hairs  i think we should talk to the kid  why in case hes telling the truth  youre a believer arent you  well im just not arrogant enough to think  that of the 50 billion galaxies 100 billion stars per galaxy  and 10 million billion planets in the universe  that were the only ones with life  no but im guessing were the only ones who like shoving things  through our back doors there is new research indicating a link  between neurological problems and bleeding disorders  perfect especially if there were neurological problems  what part of hallucinating an alien abduction isnt neurological  it wasnt a hallucination  what you think the kid  hes having nightmares  nightmares arent a symptom of anything other than wanting to sleep with mommy  which just leaves us with one symptom the bloody tuchus  which can easily explained by a gi problem or bleeding disorder  check his coags with a pt ptt and bleeding time  and prep him for endoscopies from above and below  im gonna make a tiny nick in your forearm okay  then im gonna time how long it takes for you to stop bleeding  now this is gonna sting a little so you might wanna look the other way  are those windows locked  those windows dont even open theyre just here to let sunshine in  good cause they know im here  clancy dont bother the doctor with this stuff  no its okay how do they know youre here  they put a chip in my neck so they can keep track of me  i can feel it back there  clancy you know there is nothing back there  there is  let me see lean forwards  and they have this other thing and they put it in between these two ribs  always on this side and then they move it around my insides  it hurts  you know what clancy  i think i might have found the chip back there  and i think i might be able to get it out really  mmmhmm  okay lean forwards  now hold very still okay  got it  exhales  im seven not three all you did was pinch my neck  sorry  his alienabduction story the level of detail is  well i dont know where he gets it from  the parents say he doesnt watch scifi he doesnt read comic books  great you do any of that medical stuff we talked about  upper and lower endoscopies were clean  so its a simple bleeding disorder  no blood tests are all normal and he clotted in six minutes  so its a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test  i didnt screw up the test  so its a ufo unidentified flowing orifice  either you screwed up the test or i screwed up my analysis of this case  if you screwed up i dont have to cry myself to sleep  its a simple bleeding disorder foreman redo the test  how could i screw up a simple bleedingtime test  maybe you were abducted lost time  kids got a bleeding disorder  sure  i had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes  so youre saying chase did screw up  or foreman screwed up  big hand points to minutes maybe you got it mixed up  oh snap foremans playing the dozens  youre at a huge cultural disadvantage here chase  take a couple of minutes to think of a witty retort  so we have contradicting bleedingtime tests  if we run labs to check his clotting factors we can confirm which ones right  yeah testing nice idea  way better than trying to guess which doctors incompetent  looks better in the paperwork too  hey foreman your mamas so fat when her beeper goes off  people think shes backing up  wheres clancy  hes asleep hes  house clancys gone missing  oh no you take alpha centauri foreman can look on tatooine  and cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint  lets pray he hasnt gone into hyperdrive well never catch him  grunting  clancy  i had to go where there are no windows so i could get the chip out like you said  god  i can feel it i just cant grab it  clancy stop there is no chip  were gonna clean you up and were gonna go back to your room  you cant do things like this your parents  sighs  results came back the lab cannot identify the metal  said it might not even be terrestrial  really  no you idiot its titanium like from a surgical pin  like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago  nice medical history  that pin was removed six months  so a little piece broke off during removal  titanium is used to build nuclear subs pieces dont just break off  tell that to the guys on the kursk  and how exactly did it get from his arm to the back of his neck  body attacks any foreign object  inflammatory reaction could erode it into a vein fragment gets a free ride  to his lungs maybe not his neck  yeah an alien chip makes more sense  the real mystery is that you didnt actually screw up  you okay  fine tripped  kid carved a hole in the back of his neck  apparently didnt bleed to death now thats weird  he clotted on his own  sure did  so first there was no bleeding disorder then there was now theres not again  which is impossible  or foreman screwed up  two out of three tests agree with my findings  lucky for us the fourth test will be the charm  so youre just gonna keep cutting him until what  this test is different  well draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing  but why havent the other tests weve got three results  they havent been consistent one of them must be wrong  or two of them  is it possible the problem isnt his blood its just psychological  i mean he almost killed himself  he wasnt trying to hurt himself  no he was just looking for an alien tracking device  i have time for one more  cant blame you for spending extra time down here  i heard the artist formerly known as gimp is back upstairs  oh dr cuddy wants that one  shes busy ill take it  oh my god youre  youre okay  have we met  i was one of your doctors  you were in a vegetative state when you left here last week  addisons disease  all i needed was cortisol and my brain turned on like a switch  this is amazing  surprised you didnt know  how would i know  not quite my old self yet  baby steps the doctors tell me now  with rehab youll do great what hospital did you go to  how would i i wanna have sex with my wife  and i was hoping that maybe you could  viagra youre here for viagra  a bucketful would be nice  dr cuddy  hi  its completely unethical  he was reckless with a patient  he was right but he didnt know that  he needs at least some glimmer of humility  why does he need that  because other people have that why does he need to be like other people  he needs to be less reckless  well you did it  hes dismissing symptoms looking for easy solutions hes in pain  how much pain why  you know this is affecting him dont you  telling him that he got his last case right wont do anything to help him  itll make him less depressed which might not help his leg  but you dont know  just let me run a pet scan  on his parietal thalamic area to see if its sensing pain  if it is the ketamine isnt working anymore and hes headed for a huge crash  if its not the leg pain is my fault and i will tell him the truth  too tight  my parents think im crazy  no they dont  theyre just worried about you thats all  im not weird  its just that weird things keep happening to me  slight pinch  if you make me better do you think the aliens will leave me alone  i dont think theyre gonna be bothering you for much longer  are you lying again  no  we figure this out everythings gonna be okay  panting  still with us  gasping  nurse lets go  chase pulmonary edema stagetwo hypertensive crisis  what is happening wait outside  get him oxygen and start him on an iv drip of sodium nitroprusside  get them outside  hes in icu systolic is hovering around 170  i left instructions to lower it slowly so we dont risk hypoperfusing his organs  tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke  mi and blindness  im open to suggestions  solve the case kidneys could explain kidneys are clean  tell me hes a mutanthuman hybrid  it is a bleeding disorder  clancy tested positive for von willebrands  i didnt screw up  how could he clot on his own two out of three times  maybe he cheated chase right  kids always cheat on their bleedingtime tests  she was being metaphorical shes trying to sound like me  i have no idea what you meant but i could smell what the rock was cooking  i meant hes clotting right now and hes in hypertensive crisis  maybe the two are related  what if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted  hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors  even someone low on von willebrands could theoretically clot  and the first time clancy clotted he was all worked up  recounting his alien abduction he couldve easily been hypertensive  i know i get worked up when i cut microchip tracking implants out of my neck  sounds like a cheat to me  yeah we get it  okay whats the differential for a sevenyearold boy  suffering multiple hypertensive crises  we think the problem is in your sons heart  we need to do a procedure called a transesophageal echo  okay and that will fix his heart  that will tell us where the problem is hopefully then we can fix him  listen this isnt really part of my job  but hes worried that you think hes crazy  well isnt he  there are still plenty of other explanations for whats going on  its important he knows you believe in him even if you dont  foreman its clean his heart isnt the problem  why dont i have a highdef in my office im a department head  there are no structural defects valves are intact  tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of legos  see this is what im talking about  foreman you gotta steal this thing for me  let me ring up one of the homies  the clearer the image the clearer it is that there are no masses no clots no tears  the problems gotta be somewhere else  were gonna need a bigger boat  heartbeat thumping  youre wrong house  think hell make us break into the imax before he admits it  there where  right there left side no movement  well dont freeze it somethings not moving  how do you see something not move if nothings moving  i need a laser pointer  we dont have a laser pointer well why not  whos gonna take us seriously if we dont have a laser pointer  right here  a few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest  so youve found an arrhythmia  thats not an arrhythmia thats a norhtyhmia  myocytes contract these arent moving at all  go get me those myocytes i wanna talk to them in my office  hows the kid doing  heart nearly exploded still beating though  most of it anyway  why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things  when all you have to do is click yes i am 18  even a 17yearold can figure that out  whats going on with the leg  first tell me whats going on with the boobs  if youre feeling pain theyre firmer  its called an underwire  i wanna get a pet scan of your brain  i think its hormones  as long as theres no increased activity in the thalamus  looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business  then the pain can be good it could be muscle regenerating  after you workout you get sore pain doesnt mean the ketamine failed  guess i should be saying mazel tov who gets to pass out the cigars  im not pregnant i need to get a pet scan of your brain  boy or girl you got a name picked out im not pregnant  my leg doesnt hurt youre in denial  no im not  oh you got me  sighs  if i thought that my leg was deteriorating  dont you think id want to take steps to prevent that  sighs  okay  pager beeping  gotta go  groans  exclaims  sighs  heres clancys dna  and heres the dna from that piece of his heart we just biopsied  that is impossible  run it again  we already did and once more after that  the genes from clancys myocytes dont match the genes  from the rest of his body  alien dna  anybody watch any x files that inspired an explanation  there are ways dna can become mutated extreme uv radiation  that much sun hed be dying with a healthy bronze glow  nitrous acid or ethidiumbromide exposure  first daddy was a rapist now hes a chemist  chase various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic  not unless the kids been eating barrels of celery or living in indonesia or both  is your leg hurting is that question helping  youre leaning youre sitting  youre evading my heads hurting  please someone give me a plausible terrestrial explanation  for this kids alien dna  we could search his home for toxins fungals and radiation  who cares what caused it a kid comes in with strep  we dont conduct a search to see which classmate he got it from we cure it  we know hes got the stuff inside him lets get a scalpel and cut it out  where do we cut chances are its not just in his heart  well we got lucky with the heart myocytes contract  we could see that these werent working  i dont know how the hell were gonna find it anywhere else  what if we take the heart cells with the bad dna and we tag them  can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor  its the same way we search for cancer  the bad dna creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells  we create an antibody that recognizes only that protein  we flush it throughout his system and the similar cells light up  like light bulbs  okay lets do that  you have to tell him  he said he wasnt in any pain  hes lying of course hes lying  we need another plan  dont talk about it that way  what way  plan  it sounds like were conspiring against him im gonna tell him  no youre not then come up with a cunning plan and fast  shes not nearly as delightful as she thinks she is  whats this machine do  makes a lot of noise  and its gonna help us figure out whats wrong with you  you think house has lost a step  hes fine  there clump of affected cells in the bone marrow of the femur  explains the intermittentbleeding disorder  cause i dont need to subject myself to houses torture if theres no upside  im telling you hes fine  we missed some affected cells in his heart  explains the continuing hypertensive issues  you said the last case really threw him and now suddenly  i was wrong  so you changed your mind why  his brilliant ideas on this case have all been yours  theres the reason for him needing glasses  apparently its a symptom it means the condition predates  you dont change your mind without a reason now what do you know  house didnt blow the last case  cuddy cured the guy using houses idea  cuddy and wilson are trying to teach him some humility  scan is complete three hot spots but nothing in his brain  houses original theory was right it is not neurological  todd is he going to be able to walk  chase his leg should be functional after some rehab  stephanie functional what does that mean  hell be able to walk but not run hell have a limp  if everything goes well hell walk hell run  hell probably be even stronger than he is now  when we close him up well move over to his other leg  snake a catheter up through the femoral artery and into his heart  once the affected areas are removed  his normal tissue will step back in do its job  he should have no more problems with his blood pressure  after confirming those areas are clear well start the final procedure  were gonna insert a needle through the pupil  and get rid of the abnormal cells in the retina  close your right eye can you see my face  yeah its clear  you can throw away your glasses we got it all  get some sleep youre going home tomorrow  thank you  do you wanna go for a run  what do you want  i want you to run  when did you become an enabler  im enabling you to exercise  vicodin blocks the pain you get through your rehab  muscle strength increases and pain decreases  id rather not become dependent on pain pills to get through my day  youre just like any other patient  running away from knowledge that wont make you happy  im as happy as a pig in poop  youre scared the ketamine treatments wearing off  that it was just a torturous window to the good life  what part of poop didnt you understand  how can you be so sure it isnt just a sore muscle  its my leg weve known each other a long time  youre not always right house youve proven that lately  stephanie whats happening to him  hes seizing i need clonazepam  i thought you got it all yeah yell at me thatll fix your kid  obviously we missed some foreign tissue theres something still in him  the hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe  sorry house it is neurological looks like youre wrong again  we didnt miss anything brain scan was completely clean  our tag must not have penetrated the bloodbrain barrier  dont use an iv this time get it right into the brain  no cells are lighting up his brain is clean it is not neurological  his symptoms are neurological his condition has to be neurological  his scan was clean twice its not there  what if it is there but didnt show up on the scan  what if the tag just doesnt work in his brain  brain cells are structurally different express a different protein  so how do we find it  where are we going  i am going to think  send the kid home  what do you mean  make sure his blood pressures stabilized and send him home  what like nothing ever happened  we cured his bleeding disorder  removed all the damaged cells we could find  we dont know that we fixed anything its only been a day  maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder  its more probable that his remaining symptoms are  just a nightmare  he had a convulsion  may be epilepsy may be psychological may be nothing  if the kid gets sick again itll give us another clue  we can start searching again if he doesnt doesnt matter  send him home  motorcycle engine starts  house  youre just giving up on this kid  you gotta know when to stop  you dont stop you never stop  you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane  that its usually right  except on my last case  dont be pathetic just forget the last case  this kid obviously has something wrong with him  when did you develop such strong opinions about my patients  last week you were convinced my patient wasnt sick  now youre convinced this one is  this one is a young boy his parents are desperate  just get together with your team spend a few extra hours  well i guess we could amputate his left leg thats where we found most of it  maybe we should just remove his affected eye completely  if you have reason to believe that that might help  im not gonna start lopping off body parts  but its interesting that you give me the green light  i just want you to do something  youve been overly supportive this entire week  either youre hormonal or youre guiltridden  and its too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal  im not pregnant then what did you do wrong  he had addisons your last patient you were right  i gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like rip van winkle  scoff  oh your mommy is in such trouble shes such a liar  thats why you dont have a daddy thats why she had to  how does one person end up with two different sets of dna  weve been through this  our assumptions are faulty  weve confirmed two different sets of dna we reran the sequence  i didnt say the lab work was faulty i said our assumptions were faulty  we assumed hes a person  of course the aliens didnt just visit him they replaced him  youre being silly what if hes not a person what if hes two persons  im not getting the metaphor no metaphor  chase you said the mom used in vitro fertilization right  yeah they had trouble conceiving  kid was right all along  he was implanted with something back when he was young  i mean really young like 12cells young  in vitro increases the likelihood of twinning  but he doesnt have a twin  not walking around  but in vitro fertilization costs around 25 grand a pop  so doctors implant two to six embryos to make sure you get your moneys worth  problem is theres not always enough bedrooms for all the kiddies  two brothers get stuck sharing theres no bunk beds  so they cuddle up to keep warm and they never untangle  hes two people in one  its called chimerism  unfortunately his brothers like a bad doubles partner  the guy just takes up space gets in the way  clancys body thinks that hes gonna put away the easy winners  his brother just keeps swatting balls into the net  we gotta get him off the court  so does that mean that you can find the bad cells in his brain or not  sure abandon the metaphor fine  clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks  if we induce an alien abduction  wait what the hell are you talking about  the foreign dna has got to be in a portion of your sons brain  that makes him believe that hes being abducted  if we stimulate those neurons with an electric probe  we can trick your sons brain into hallucinating  your sons neurons will light up and his brothers cells will remain dark  those are the ones we cut out  youre talking about brain surgery  im talking about really cool brain surgery one of your sons will die  but the taller one wont be so annoying anymore  so i have a twin  not really whats on the card  a light bulb  start us out at 10  im not doing that  that was all me kid sorry  youre in motor function try two centimeters back  he lives inside me  sort of  that tickles stop tickling my feet  youre in sensory youre getting closer  what do you see on this one  moon and stars  so i am kind of weird  were all kind of weird  no  clancy we got something  what do you see the light  here they come i think  brain waves indicate a mild hallucination neurons are lighting up  any dark spots areas too fuzzy  hallucination isnt strong enough  turn up the juice  his blood pressures already  riding the short bus is better than not breathing take us to 100  areas still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction  crank it up higher youve already exceeded  the preset maximum next steps brain damage  theyre gonna get you theyre coming through the walls  theyre gonna take you torture you youll never see your parents again  gasping  clancy can you hear me  clancy  you got them  yep  we got them all  close him up  everythings gonna be normal again  you believe what cuddy tried to pull  what now  she lied to me  she cured my patient with my diagnosis then lied to me about it  that doesnt sound like her  youre right  does sound like you though  what exactly did cuddy tell you  nothing that your body language isnt telling me right now  so what was the plan  id feel so humbled by missing a case that id reevaluate my entire life  question the nature of truth and goodness and become cameron  something like that more that if we told you the truth  that you solved a case based on absolutely no medical proof  youd think you were god  and i was worried your wings would melt  god doesnt limp  gravity playing
