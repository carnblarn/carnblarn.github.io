we need to talk  oh god are you pregnant  because i really want to finish high school  you have to renew your credential  theyre good for two more months  three weeks and the paperwork takes forever  your application  your malpractice insurance  criminal records check  and you know thats gonna take some explaining  you know our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together  why did we stop doing that did you get married  yeah otherwise id be on you like red on rice  rice isnt oh i get it  youre also behind on your dictations  i dont do dictations  cameron does them or somebody  you cant have your sole female employee doing your clerical work  which youd know if youd attended the required sexual harassment seminars  now im gonna pause so you can make a crack about harassment  joke killer  cuddy house  got a patient   sorry  cant play anymore my moms calling me   we just admitted a worldclass cyclist  youve gotta fire stacy  yeah ill get right on that  jeff forster  respiratory arrest at 30 miles per hour  shes loading me up with pointless paperwork  well youre way behind on your pointless paperwork   o2 stats are in the  shes hostile  you know me hostility makes me shrink up like a  i cant think of a nonsexual metaphor  shes gonna stand over my desk with a ruler checking my spelling  er checked for lung infiltrates nothing there  professional athletes cuddy  its like watching an old movie at 200 am reliving all the classic moments  the part where he denies its drugs  the part where the good guys ride in tests ablazing prove that it is drugs  oscar clip he cant imagine how they got into his body  its so familiar so comforting  she cant handle working with me   oh right yeah  shes still got a thing to you making it impossible for her to deal  makes perfect sense except for the pronouns  anyway thanks for getting me out of that meeting  hes not denying the drugs  im thinking hes actually sick   jeff forster this is  im a doctor  youre a sick person  and youare a loved one  actually manager weve been together for seven years  so whats the drug du jour on the bike circuit these days  still erythropoietin or you guys just chugging battery acid  theres no way id touch epo   too many guys stroking out  and dying  damn  ten bucks for the ticket six for the popcorn  i do straight blood doping  plot twist  thats a very daring confession  weve got confidentiality right  assuming im more ethical than your client  so injecting yourself with donor red blood cells for fun and profit  any other tricks up your sleeve  well nothing much recently   im in town for a charity ride so it didnt matter if i won   the kids just needed to see me  if you go slower they see you longer  lets say that our health could be affected by things we did before last friday   well  um i usually sleep in a hyperbaric chamber   ive been pumping up electrolytes with an iv drip  anabolic herbal supplements amphetamines  and diuretics  yeah yeah yeah  but why would you be sick  i know that doping has risks   i know that its outside the rules   but i do what i have to to kick ass  at my job   dont you  dr house is a firm believer in good oldfashioned hard work  ahhh  this guy doesnt even get sick like a regular person  instead of a list of symptoms and no cause we have a list of possible causes for one symptom  chase is the symptom death  respiratory distress  and insanity doesnt cause it i looked it up  its the doping  injecting extra red cells boosts your endurance level but it also thickens your blood  thick blood equals clots equals respiratory distress  not with a clean spiral chest ct  guys sleeping in an hyperbaric chamber  overoxygenation can cause cell damage and if the cells in the lungs are damaged  thatd cause pulmonary edema which he doesnt have  the supplements hes been taking contain yohimbe which can cause nerve paralysis  tox screen was normal  all the tests were normal  theres no clot no edema and yet he still cant breathe  so theres something in here that we cant see  oh air  come to papa  this guys been injecting himself how many times a day  all itd take is one slip of the needle to cause an air embolus  so air is keeping him from breathing air  lets go with that for the irony  get a vq scan and check his veins for bubbles  xenon 133  its just radioactive enough for us to track the air moving through your lungs  my accident on the news  yeah you made plays of the week  few more of those and cycling will be as popular as nascar  we inject similar stuff into your blood so we can watch it circulate  now if you accidentally injected a bubble well see good air flow but poor blood flow   unhuh im careful man    with all due respect man   i doubt theres anything wrong with you that you didnt do to yourself  theres this kid in oncology shes got a picture of jeff above her bed  mickey mantle was an alcoholic  cameron at least he hit his own home runs  he didnt physically alter himself  we take drugs to help us fall asleep to stay awake  we dont make careers out of who can stay awake the longest  really ever been to oh i dont know med school  uh guys he plays a game for a living who cares  you dont even like sports  hes making millions of dollars ripping off fans  anyone who thinks they should pay a guy money  because he can throw a ball really far or pedal really fast deserves to be ripped off  yeah stupid stupid kids  ive got an uncle he can spit a cherry pit 50 yards  hes working parttime at a lube shop life isnt fair    maybe it is  chase you were right  now there went three wasted words  there is a bubble in his lung  we should do a swanganz catheterization  i love when you do both sides of the conversation  its like white noise its very peaceful  is there a light somewhere that goes on when i have food  green for food orange for beverages red for impure thoughts  that bulb burns out every two weeks  hows your biker  pumped an air bubble into a vein in his lung  the things people do  doping vicodin  hey youre talking about me arent you  im just trying to function hes trying to win himself some little yellow jerseys   uhoh  what  trouble in paradise two oclock  your two oclock or my two oclock  there  she seems perfectly happy  obviously they huddled in the hall and worked up this circus act on the offchance youd be in here  she was unbelievably pissy three hours ago  hmm pissy with you happy with her husband  yes there could only be one possible explanation for that  when shes angry she gets sarcastic  whens she annoyed shes funny  but when shes frustrated she gets pissy  yes yes im with you so far  shes miserable with mark because hes not me  so shes gotta make me not me so she makes my professional life miserable if i cant do my job  you really really need to get some  oh i get some some all the time  thats why i always need to borrow some money  stacy hi james  greg gotten to that paperwork   ive been pissy  pardon me  ive been busy  when you save someones life they owe you forever  youre right take stacy  oh wait shed probably just leave you all over again  house hows your recovery going  gotten around to the small muscles yet  its not the size of the muscle  its where you get to put it  my goodness its like watching oscar wilde and noel coward in the third grade  excuse us  how awkward was that  whats he doing here anyway hes got physio tuesdays and fridays  uh mark is in group therapy for people coping with disability  he was thinking about developing a drug addiction but that would be stupid  hey youreyou again  not gonna make some joke about mark being in therapy  whats there to say  hes doing the responsible thing  im sure hes got a lot to deal with  youre making me nervous   every time an athlete goes down you guys assume its drugs  look the doctors say its probably acid reflux  yeah look call me tomorrow  theres a good chance hell be released okay byebye   so is this fixing him  if his acid reflux isnt worse than we thought yeah  ive gotta be in spain in  four days  shouldnt be a problem  great  if i can just find the little bugger i should be able to suck it out  hmm my legs feel weak  youre under mild sedation for the test  itll wear off   there it is  ah got it  oh fantastic ill pack his things  not yet i want to monitor him for a couple of hours make sure hes okay  give him time to sign a picture for me  maybe even a jersey  to dr chase i owe you everything  it doesnt have to be that personal  oh not too many ebay shoppers named dr chase huh   still trying to unload the barbara walters spit cup  here you go  seriously anythings fine  jeff  chase you all right  chase jeff can you swallow  hosue what makes a guy start drooling  chase were you wearing your short shorts  muscle fatigue in his neck and jaw  hes obviously got something worse than an air embolus  why  because you dont drool from your lungs  maybe the problems not the embolus itself  maybe its the treatment  maybe you hit a nerve literally  the embolectomy was clean  his legs were tired too  i thought it was from the sedation but if not  it means hes got something systemic  which means it would have nothing to do with the stunts hes been pulling  lupus or polymyositis  it explains the progressive muscle weakness   it could be als  hes too young for that   some type of muscular dystrophy  hes too old for that  so what would be just right goldilocks  house full blood workup including ana for lupus  and get a muscle biopsy  find out if were talking myopathy or neuropathy  im late for my session  session  its all a part of the process   you get angry and then you get  yeah im right on schedule  so when am i gonna be done  no i need to know because ive got plans to make i mean  when can i safely book a game of squash  mark when am i gonna stop being angry  not today  ive come for the healing  dr harper as you know i uhahem  i have a bum leg  what you dont know is im upset about it  i need to talk  you know house you know we have a history  youve been telling me for years that i should come by  here i am hi guys  dr harper got a thursday group  poker night  monday morning  book club  well look if its a problem ill just go deal with my rage privately  wait  if you two could resolve this tension you could really help each other  im tired of fighting    so either i say yes or im the jerk  oh god i know that feeling  i took the muscle specimen from jeffs thigh  i figured thats where wed have the best chance at finding something  and the most painful place to cut into  i assume thats caffeinefree  wouldnt want to be artificially boosting your performance  dont start her up again  caffeines legal  all about the rules eh  its a bike race  a completely arbitrary set of rules that everyone complies with for no other reason than that some committee says that they should   huh  but thats the point  thats what the game is  so if you break an arbitrary rule cameron damns you to hell  but if you break a rule that actually has a reason  thats designed to protect people cameron develops a crazy crush on you  house doesnt pretend to be some golden boy  he does it to help people not to glorify himself  so why dont you report jeff to the biking authorities  um ethics  well you wouldnt be doing it to glorify yourself  youd just be trying to make a better world  mark at least you can still get around on your own  yeah i know  but youre starting to walk  youre gonna get better  mark you have a job a way to be productive  you have a wife  which gives greater meaning   a wife could make things harder too i suppose  this isnt about stacy  when it happened to me stacy was great  she kept telling me not to rush it  but i never believed her  she means it  i know but  stacyshe didnt have to wait right  and you know she feels it too  means more time at work means more satisfaction from work  she didnt get married to be a nursemaid  she wants a man  oh   how the hell could she have loved a manipulative son of a bitch like you  thats an interesting question  maybe she was attracted to different things in the two of us  she left you  then why was she with me to begin with  she made a mistake  maybe its that simple  or maybe she saw something in me something she doesnt get from you   im not an ass  maybe she wanted an ass she obviously did once  either he goes or i go  you think thats the kind of thing you can just turn off  get him out of here  dr house cancel your book group  youre coming on mondays  heres my new theory  the droolings another competitive edge  nobody can drive behind him  road gets slick hes the only one not racing in the rain  he can barely move his arms or legs   paralysis  no just general weakness  muscle biopsy is negative for polymyositis  and als and muscular dystrophy  foreman ana for lupus also negative  cameron maybe his bike shorts were just on too tight  so by your rationale house shouldnt use a cane  he should just drag his bum leg around as god intended  house has a handicap all hes aiming for is normality  chase and who decides whats normal  what if we find a drug that makes people live 20 years longer  should we ban that because its not normal  jeff doesnt want normal he wants super powers  so why is he normal  oh god you too  hes shooting for extraordinary  so why is everything so ordinary  i mean this guys breathing drinking and injecting himself  with everything he can find to amp up his body chemistry and yet every test is normal  hes artificially raising his red blood count so why isnt it raised  maybe his count is raised maybe whats normal for us is out of whack for him  cant slip anything by you  well if thats true his white cells are up too  which would point to some kind of infection  muscle weakness exhaustion  he could have encephalitis  thats kind of a long shot  yeah but its been over an hour since we poked the patient with something sharp so  get a lumbar puncture and order broadspectrum antibiotics   no its not about judging  its just that on a dating service you should post a photo  i have to go   im so sorry to bother you  no not a problem i was just uh   accounting  im jeff forsters manager  hes been here a whole day and it doesnt seem like were any closer to a diagnosis  jeff forster a whole day huh  mmhmm i was just wondering if i could help speed things up  your clients had a muscle biopsy a full blood workup  and hes scheduled for a lumbar puncture at 1000 am tomorrow  jeff is in the lucas wing  if mr lucas showed up needing a lumbar puncture  would he have to wait until tomorrow  mr lucas is dead  good then theres an opening  jeff is used to doing whatever he has to to be first isnt he  its been very lucrative for him  he feels its important that he give something back  i hear youve been raising funds for your nuclear medicine department  or whatever  thank you guys for working so late   glad to be here  the lumbar puncture will tell us what kind of infection youve got  in the meantime were administering antibiotics  do you like being a hero   its a living  you dont feel a sense of responsibility  theres kids out there that worship you  when i was a rookie  on the tour   i got a letter from a guy in wisconsin   who wanted me to send a note to his son   said he worshipped me   you know what worship means  i looked it up  it means to love unquestioningly and uncritically   so the kid doesnt even know me   but he loves me  unquestioningly  and uncritically  so you decided to take advantage of that  what should i have done   dear sir  im just a guy  who rides a bike  pretty good   you and your kid are  out of your minds    my arms feel funny     foreman his sats are dropping hes in respiratory arrest  he cant be we fixed that  apparently not  house so glad we cured his respiratory arrest  freed him up to develop respiratory arrest  foreman lp was negative for encephalitis  the white counts still the same but the red counts fallen to 29  what was my theory yesterday  that i screwed up the embolectomy  well get a chest xray to check  i didnt screw up why would you  how can you be so petty chase hes down a quart  either hes losing blood because you nicked something  or hes just not producing blood in which place were talking  acute anemia combined with a muscular disorder  paraneoplastic syndrome  either you screwed up or hes got cancer  i think i should start smoking again  you want a medical opinion supporting that decision  the symptoms started as soon as i quit  symptoms meaning  diarrhea  a lot of diarrhea  ten or twelve times a day its really embarrassing  im a flight attendant and    on the upside my hiccups are gone  you went to his group  you were the one who was all greg you need to confront your feelings   that was five years ago  well ive been pissy  fine you dont want help does that mean nobody should get it  marks looking for help because what hes resentful  overwhelmed im asking because i care  not about him  you still want to jump me so you dont care whose marriage  listen i can get my rocks off any time i want  what i dont seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder    how many packs  a bit over one a day but they were lights and i quit  you used to go out with her  yeah what was i thinking  im talking about the gum youre chewing to replace smoking as an oral fixation  how many packs  six maybe seven  stacy im trying to protect you  cuddy and i may be the only people stopping you from jumping off a cliff   youre pissy  no i am angry  pissy you get pissy when youre frustrated  shut up  okay im wrong  this is unbelievably difficult for mark which you should know  which you should be able to summon up some level of empathy for  right the crippled boys  we should start a band  i have a good thing with mark  we are handling this the best way we know how  and none of this has anything to do with me  no nothing except that you cant or wont just let it go  let it go    youre being poisoned  by gum  sugarless gum uses sorbitol as a sweetener  we use sorbitol as a laxative  moira thisll tell you if hes got cancer in his blood  if he does well see abnormal cells in the marrow  how long will the test take  ill get them in as soon as i can  and if doesnt have cancer what else could it be  its possible some damage was done during one of the tests we gave him  so either one of your doctors screwed up a simple procedure or hes got cancer  we cant know anything for sure until the biopsy comes back  it stings i know  no he wants the tube out  cant do that jeff  wilson if you want to say something youve got to write it down  okay  here    if its cancer its possible  theres no way to know for sure  phone not working  one of the morgue attendants asked me to bring this to you  i wonder why theyre calling me  yeah me too actually i was wondering why the times was returning your call  you a doctor or the bicycle police  hes cheating  he shouldnt get away with it   have you actually told them anything yet  you worried about the precedent  im worried about you  you gonna turn me in  no  hes made a mistake  revealing the truth doesnt undo it  kids love him and hes not who they think he is  its not right  who cares if hes what he says he is who the hell is  if loves based on lies does that mean its not a real feeling  doesnt bring the same pleasure  are we still talking about the patient  have you ever cheated  well i have you want to punish him good for you  but you cant do it without punishing the people who love him  is that you justified lying to you wives  i always told them  foreman well hes negative for bleeds  congratulations chase its cancer  clean him up and let oncology have him  hosue its their party now  he doesnt have cancer  biopsy shows hes got pure red cell aplasia  theres no way prca could manifest so suddenly  unless its druginduced hes lying about not being on epo  why would he lie  what does it matter  people lie for thousands of reasons but theres always a reason  philosophically interesting medically irrelevant  unless hes not lying   youve got a leak  the press is all over the jeff forster story  on the offchance that one of you was stupid enough to call from your own office  im pulling your phone records including your cell phones  i assume if i point out the fact that you have no right to do that youll interpret that as a sign of guilt  wilsons chatty  house plus hes got two exwives to support you want me to tell him hes fired  until we figure out whos behind this im sitting in with you guys  you have the ethics of a fouryearold im gonna treat you like one  how am i supposed to practice medicine with a lawyer sitting on my shoulder  responsibly  you know i cant do that  cameron  im not the leak  somebody once told me that everybody lies  and since youre the only people who know he has cancer  he doesnt have cancer  cuddy the point is youre his medical team  hes threatening to sue  why would cameron leak cancer  how does cancer make the guy look bad  hes on epo  your anemia is caused by pure red blood cell aplasia  this is gonna hurt but weve gotta talk  what the hell are you doing  hell be fine sort of   i just dont have time to watch him write out answers  prca comes in two varieties  chronic and acute  since it came on fast you have the acute version  he doesnt have cancer  is the good news the bad new is  pants are on fire  acute prca is caused by drugs  most commonly epo  ready andaction  but i havent used epo   okay  but this time with more anger  remember this guys accusing you of cheating  i havent used that stuff   oh mwah i believed it  it was simple it was pure did you believe it  i guess its silly to cast someone after the first audition  why dont you do a reading  give me that he doesnt do epo  hmm what did you think  i mean its a different way to go but i dont know i just didnt buy it  does she handle any of your injections  you think im giving it to him  test him  gee thats a great idea  i sure hope that epos not one of those drugs thats undetectable after six hours  hey you know what we can test for  phone calls  take her cell phone push the redial button  even money says youll be connected to the newspaper that leaked your cancer story  okay  okay i shouldve told you  its not just about the races jeff  its about your image okay  if you come back from cancer those sponsors will be all over you  okay so i messed up okay but i did not give you epo  that stuff could kill me  meh meh meh meh  house come on give her a break  shes only doing what she has to do to advance her career  dont you have that tattooed on your tushie  i would never do anything to hurt you  house who are you gonna believe  the manager youve trusted for years  pff ive been to college  youre fired  okay  youre basing this whole diagnosis everything  on the idea that i was slipping him illegal drugs  huh  youre gonna kill him  if dr house is so sure why do you need to stay  hes a very cautious man  youre breathings better  let the prednisone do its job get some sleep    jeff    his red blood cell count plummeted to 16  he passed out had to be resuscitated and he still cant move his legs  thats not possible the drugs should be flushing out of his system  cant leave if they dont exist  the epo use explains every one of his symptoms  hes been lying and cheating and now its coming back to bite him  the only problem with that theory is its based on the assumption that the universe is a just place  if it were then his poor manager wouldnt have been fired for no reason   lamberteaton  his chest was clear  chase so we run an electromyography test  cameron youre still not explaining the prca  whats his red count now  i had to give him a blood transfusion hes back around 30  he needed a transfusion  well he was losing blood so i thought maybe he needed blood    go forth and scan his neck  his neck  or repeat everything i say in question form  she came into the clinic and yelled at me  then she left then she came back and yelled some more  hmm yelling  that might be a clue  well i know what the yelling means  its the coming and going i find interesting   its not rational  angers not rational  some anger is  she couldve pulled me aside screamed at my privately  her beef is simple and wellfounded  but she was out of control  youre having fun arent you  shes in my face i need to know why   professional reasons  oh why else  do you really think this is going to end well  for anyone  after this lets scan some other total random body parts  we find something  find what  dont have a clue we on  no way  no well find something  chase we found a thymoma  foreman howd you know to look in his neck  thymomas usually present in the chest  i knew it wasnt in his chest  all weve done since he checked in is look at his chest   well all the more reason not to think  there are two types of prca  acute comes on suddenly chronic takes its time  we all thought jeffs was acute because it happened right in front of us  but what if it had been there for months maybe years  theres no way it wouldve kept him from racing  with that kind of anemia he wouldve needed constant  blood transfusions  which he was getting in convenient blood doping form    he was treating himself without even knowing it  up to half of patients with chronic prca have a thymoma  and up to half the patients with a thymoma  ive always wanted to do this  im not getting any better   does that mean im  ow  you are healed  rise and walk  are you insane  in the bible they just say yes lord and then start right in on the praising  first you tell me ive got cancer   and then you tell me that my manager  huh  huh huh  what did you do  no what do you do lord  thymoma is a tumor on the thymus gland  hes a bit a wimp but he hangs with the tough guys  prca and an autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis  mg causes muscle fatigue including respiratory problems and difficulty swallowing  oh and it can hit you that fast  the treatment for prca is blood transfusions  the treatment for mg is hyperbaria  you were doing both as part of your regular freak show  when you took a break everything went to hell  which is not an uncommon reaction to jersey  so  the whole thing with my manager  oops no  no epo  this has nothing to do with anything you did  you can let her know shes in the clear  i could or  ten perfect of a nike contract is a hell of a lot of cash  god  you dont need your thymus  we take it out everything else is manageable  manageable i thought you just cured me  unuh this is just diagnostic  tensilon erases the symptoms of mg for five or six minutes    sometimes less  this is exactly why i created nurses  clean up on aisle three  if youve come to search my office you should wait ten minutes ill be out of your hair  here start with my purse just save me some mints  what do you want to know my sex life with mark  my guilt over crippling your damn leg  or are you just here to gloat because you werent the leak  i want to apologize  maybe ive  been punishing you for a little too long  and maybe youve been punishing me  if were gonna work together i need to know  do you hate me or do you love me  either way i think weve got a problem  i hate you  and i love you  and i love mark  and you dont hate him  no  so what do we do  we deal with each other  hmph right  that plans been working great so far  itll get better itll get easier  why  i dont know thats what my therapist tells me   in the professional cycling world we are subject to what seems like constant witch hunts and finger pointing  but i want to thank dr house and the excellent medical team here at princeton plainsboro  my hope is that this diagnosis will put to rest any rumors that i would ever use  he needs blood transfusions every two weeks which means he can dope all he wants  hes a got a doctors pass  its medicinal  he got away with it  mmhmm  he cheated and won a game  lifes more complicated than who gets to the finish line first  i fell in love with my husbands best friend  near the end i was at the hospital every day  and joe would come by after work  wed go for walks and try to talk each other through it  we kind of clung on to each other  my wife  wasnt dying she wasnt even sick  everything was fine  i met someone whoahem  made me feelfunny  good  and i didnt want to let that feeling go  what happened to you  how can anyone go through that alone  you cant control your emotions  no  just your actions  you didnt do it did you you didnt sleep with him  i couldnt have lived with myself  youd be surprised what you can live with  hey  i need you to open a door  not allowed  yeah i was having therapy in here today and i left my cane  sorry  dude  im crippled     well youd better listen my sisters and brothers    cause if you do you can hear    there are voices still calling    across the years    and theyre all crying across the ocean    and theyre crying across the land    and they will until we all come to understand    that none of us are free    none of us are free    none of us are free if one of us is chained    none of us are free    and there are people still in darkness    and they just cant see the light    if we dont say its wrong then that says its right    none of us are free    none of us are free    none of us are free if one of us is chained    none of us are free    none of us are free    none of us are free    none of us are free if one of us is chained    none of us are free
