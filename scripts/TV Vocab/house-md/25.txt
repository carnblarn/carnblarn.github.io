                panting  good morning  hey alfredo  you done already no not yet i finish tomorrow  mexico playing argentina on tv no no  pantlng  my asthma is very bad today  six years alfredo you cant lie to me  im throwing a dinner first thing tomorrow  partys tonight  a little rain and im gonna have to put buckets on the dining room table  no clouds no rain ill tell you what  you take off but if it pours into my guests wineglasses  okay okay senora ill do it thank you  speaklng ln spanlsh  coughlng  alfredo screamlng  alfredo groanlng  slren walllng  spinal cord seems intact  take a deep breath  gasplng it hurts try  breath sounds bilateral i dont think he has a pneumothorax  just asthma that and probably a broken rib  tell me when it hurts the most  groanlng  your two little fingers are darker than the others  they feel funny como needles  how long have they been like that never noticed before  is bad  cuddy judging by how it looks he could lose his hand  how does falling off your roof do that to a guys fingers  he could have tweaked a vertebra in his neck  could impinge the ulnar  sorry trouble concentrating  that tank top really absorbs moisture  could impinge the ulnar nerve cut the blood flow  or it could be disseminated intravascular coagulopathy  dlc  guy falls off a roof the first thought is always  its a clotting problem  trauma can activate the clotting enzymes  guy could lose more than his hand thank you very much  this guys been working for me for a long time and l  do i get bonus points if i act like i care  cervical mrl work up for dlc and start him on a heparin drip  who you wanna know his name  im sure its in the file or you could ask her  shes his oldest bestest friend they were in cub scouts together  ill get started on the blood tests  you havent been a real doctor in 10 years youll make a mess all over the sheets  ill do it you have clinic duty  i still know how to handle a patient get me blood  lots of blood  theyre better theyve showered  you dont need to see him  onehanded handymen arent in big demand  talking thats how lawsuits are lost  i know you lisa  you go in you offer to pay his medical bills his wages  youll say something stupid like im sorry  you think im an idiot  i think youre not a lawyer dont go in there  trust me houses people can handle this  yeah  chase this might sting a little bit  the medicine will thin the blood and help it to circulate  those are pretty nasty scars there  i work construction  groanlng  how long will i be in the hospital  depends how long it takes us to figure out whats going on  i need to work ill get fired  im sure dr cuddy wont fire you  im a janitor at fast food six nights i need to work  my mother doesnt make enough i can work im old enough  youre old enough when you finish college  why you never went  i never had a big brother to tell me to shut up  i promise well let you out of here as soon as were able to  look l i am fine okay i feel better i go home now  no if this is a clotting problem it could be very serious  all right look you cant make me stay  wait you cant make me stay  turn your hand over  i need to see your hand  wheres dr cuddy  chase weve got a third finger turning dark  his ptt is prolonged and the fibrin split products are off  hes not clotting properly it looks like a mild case of dlc  well obviously not that mild  this keeps up his hand is literally gonna be dead meat  his hand is connected to his arm and his arm is connected to  im not sure but i bet its important  all this from falling off my roof  yeah if only hed fallen on his head  then he wouldnt have any of these symptoms  we need something stronger than heparin  human activated protein c  looks like cuddy same cleavage  protein c is indicated only for severe sepsis  how many of his limbs have to be at stake for it to be severe  but this stuff is crazy dangerous  it can cause internal bleeding  if he bleeds he could stroke he could die he could get better  you know if i try to scheme like this  you get that nasty wrinkly face and screech like a hyena  its very sexy i admit  do it  protein c is borderline irresponsible  except that the safe stuff isnt doing squat  its exactly the type of thing you would do obviously  its exactly the type of thing hed do i know  i think hes trying to protect me  now thats not the type of thing he would do  i overruled him  hes the best diagnostician in this hospital and i overrule him  you care about this kid  your judgment should be worth more than his  he also pointed out that i havent been a real doctor in years  now that sounds like him  you were just jerking cuddy around  she seriously thought i wanted to stop her  one thing cuddy is not is clueless no  first casualty of this case is her sense of humor  thats weird theres nothing funnier than almost killing a guy  im just having trouble getting up those steps  when did you start noticing oh a week ago  your blood pressures a little high  ive got something new that should help you out  it combines a nitrate with a blood pressure pill  its targeted to africanamericans  targeted  yeah well see we tend to have nitric oxide deficiencies  and the studies show this drug counteracts that problem  its the first drug to what kind of studies you talking about  what kind of studies are there  they get some patients they give them some drugs  ive had white people lying to me for 60 years  you think this is a tan you think they tell you everything  the trouble with us black folk  we cant tell the difference anymore between racism  and everybody gets screwed yeah  well how about them cheap meningitis drugs theyre pawning off in africa  gonna tell me that aint racism thats just greed  you really wanna screw whitey  be one of the few black men who live long enough to collect social security  take the medicine  ecg beeplng  gasplng nurse  nurse help nurse help  nurse whats up  i cant move my arm i cant move my arm take it easy take it easy  the protein c side effects we were worried about they happened  where was the bleed his brain  its causing right side paralysis  ive stopped the treatment and called a neurosurgeon  i can move it now  its okay now yes can i go home soon the surgery went well  but all we did was fix the problem created by the medicine we gave you  speaklng ln spanlsh  she says you you look young  are you sure theres five of us working on the case  the others are older  why doesnt dr cuddy come to  coughlng  that doesnt sound too good  cameron his fingers are even darker  his temperatures 102 and spiking  and the xray now shows lung infiltrates  well the good news is he wont be bitching about losing his hand if he cant breathe  the trauma from the fall could have caused acute respiratory distress syndrome  right i forgot your roof  it would cause lung infiltrates and maybe fever  and conceivably the cyanotic fingers  the only question is why why what  why her weird psychopathology  requires a diagnosis informed entirely by personal guilt  lets assume weve been wrong up until now  lets assume just for one second  that the earth doesnt revolve around cuddys roof  what if he was sick before he had his runin with gravity  he just didnt notice anything  well pneumonia can cause dlc which can cause cyanotic fingers  pneumonia doesnt hit that fast sure  only pavement hits that fast its not pneumonia  he might have missed a finger turning dark  hes not gonna miss breathing problems  what else its pneumonia  he wanted to go home i thought he was lying  i told him i had a dinner party i made him go up there  well why didnt you just take out a gun and shoot him  i thought it was just asthma  you mightve mentioned this earlier doctor  maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab  instead of wasting a day indulging your selfloathing  if its just gardenvariety bacterial pneumonia hes gonna be fine  so give him gardenvariety levaquin and a gardenvariety echocardiogram  and go check out the kids house  the blood work will show us which type of pneumonia it is  if hes huffing nail polish or pulling the wings off his pet parrot  this wayll be faster  and i bet julios just dying to find out whats wrong with him  go with her its alfredo  and i can handle getting a key and  rico and i no longer trust you deciding whats important and whats not  you ever think about writing a book on office politics  trust me  it would be a lot worse if i told her that you had to break into her house  stutterlng what wait wait wait cuddys house  see it is shocking  the guys been working there every day for the last three weeks  you think its impossible he couldve picked something up  im not breaking into my bosss house im your boss  shes scarier than you are  shes a woman relax im coming with  house is having lunch with his juniors now  no not a chance then where do you think theyre going  i have no idea  then why dont you think theyre going to lunch  because its not like house that was your point right  he had that smug look on his face  when hes that pleased about something  hes gotta tell somebody and the only somebody he knows is you  slghlng  hes breaking into cuddys home what  why  medical reasons  why is he so curious about cuddy  why are you so curious about his curiosity  why are you so curious about me  because you dumped him and youre married  and they are neither of those things  im just curious  nothing wrong with that no nothing wrong with that  what do you think red thongs  i think red thongs  okay 20 bucks says i can get through this door in 20 seconds  youre on count me in  no furniture polish no paint thinner nor anything else worth sniffing  nothing in here either except a few cockroaches  nice someone should fix alfredos roof  so why havent you fired house  its just you guys are always screaming at each other  and i figure you hate him so i dont hate him  why not  hes a great doctor  but any other hospital administrator would have fired him years ago  cuddy four of them did  the question is why did i hire him  foreman so howd you know about her key  you been doing a little handyman work for cuddy yourself  someone as obsessive and insecure as cuddy probably has three extra keys  hidden away within 10 feet of the door  and you consider obsession a negative quality  insecticide is organic soap is hypoallergenic  i got the bedroom  this is where it all happens  you both went to michigan did you know him while you were there  i was still an undergrad but yeah i knew him  he was already a legend  so you just knew him as a legend my god youre subtle  anything on your mind  more cockroaches worse  beautiful  theres no way you just deduced where that key was  does this count as red  you gave yourself 20 seconds and put money on it  oh my god  shes got pictures of you in here  just you its like some kind of weird shrine  youre kidding yeah  she uses super tampons what does that mean  you two are just too nasty to each other not to have been nasty  i can be a jerk to people i havent slept with  i am that good  theres nothing here  you ready to go or you got some more stuff you wanna sniff  whoa check this out  its fuzzy its black its alive  patients lung functions declining rapidly levaquins not working  he obviously doesnt have gardenvariety pneumonia  im glad you learned to take his impending death in stride  guess what he does have rats  scars on his hand rat bites  but he says theyre from construction work  so he wont have to admit hes got rats at home  catholics are right pride will kill you he has streptobacillus  ratbite fever  boogie oogie oogie fits the symptoms perfectly  thats certainly one possibility  but what about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink  what sink you ought to clean your bathroom better  you broke into my house  no no youre wrong i had a key  you had no right to invade my privacy  there was no medical reason for that whatsoever  and there was certainly no moral reason for it  oh damn  youre right  the focal consolidation makes fungal pneumonia far more likely  youre right im right  on the bright side it has the advantage of keeping you totally responsible  the treatment for aspergillus is amphotericin  thats hugely dangerous yeah your point being  going the dangerous and aggressive route didnt work the last time  its bound to work this time start him on the amphoterrible  alfredo coughlng  dr cuddy  im manny alfredos brother  hows he doing  hes worried about money i wanna work for you  slghlng  how old are you manny  fifteen twelve  i can paint i mow lawns i rake leaves i can start today  alfredo wants you to finish school  like you care  manny ive known your brother  he falls off your roof and you dont come see him once  bitch  muslc playlng on tv  with a patient  not according to the log  its 315 is it a commercial  hows cuddy doing  shes not acting like cuddy its a pleasure you know her  she has trouble with these situations feels personally responsible  the technical term is narcissism  you cant believe that everything is your fault  unless you also believe youre allpowerful  wow does she sound messed up  i dont believe i can fix everything  and i dont lie awake at night tormented by that fact  no you lie awake tormented by how  i thought we were talking about cuddy here  she cares  she enjoys feeling guilty  lisa cares its why she drives you nuts cause its not just a puzzle to her  the patients are actually real  their feelings actually relevant  and im telling her she cant even talk to him  my god its contagious youre feeling guilty too  im just saying take it easy on her you owe her that  man on tv from the moment i saw you at the ei  commercials over so glad we talked  snap crackle pop  you got some rice krispies in there  that bad huh  you were here yesterday  i see from the chart that dr foreman prescribed medicine not a miracle  got to give this stuff more than a day  i didnt fill that oreos prescription  on the theory that you didnt trust him because hes black  well im gonna prescribe the same medicine and see if you fill it this time  im not buying into no racist drug okay  scofflng  its racist because it helps black people more than white people  on behalf of my peeps let me just say thanks for dying on principle for us  look my hearts red your hearts red  and it dont make no sense to give us different drugs  you know i have found a difference  admittedly its a limited sample  but based on my experience of the last 90 seconds  all black people are morons  sorry africanamericans ill see another doctor  fine fine  ill give you the same medicine we give republicans  alfredo i think the medicine is working  theyre lighter right  they dont look lighter to me alfredo hows the tingling  does not bother me tell her the other thing  speaklng ln spanlsh  he hasnt peed since yesterday  since last night afternoon  its not a problem i dont drink much  i think well give you a little rest from the meds here  speaklng ln spanlsh  she says thats the medicine thats supposed to cure me  just making a little adjustment excuse me  hes not making any urine  i think we just destroyed the kids kidney with the amphotericin  i think hes dying  dying  cheese it the cops  sobblng ln spanlsh  i guess she understands a little english  cameron his kidneys are shutting down  due to the direct toxicity to the proximal tubule epithelium  proof that my brilliant idea of giving him amphotericin is killing him  that wasnt a complete waste of time  his reaction shows that you dont need to clean under your sink  it wasnt aspergillus  and blood cultures show he was negative for ratbite fever  theres still plenty of other cool pneumonias  tested negative for moraxella nocardia cryptococcus  he has a low titer for chlamydia antibodies maybe  no no his chest xrays all wrong for chlamydial pneumonia  but the titer points to  cameron he had an std last year that explains the titer  he has low sodium maybe its legionella no his antigen is negative  well that all sucks  maybe we were right to begin with  his problems are all caused by dlc precipitated by falling off my roof  dlc wouldnt cause a fever this high  see my lap dog agrees with me  how high  two hours ago it was 103 with acetaminophen  what about on st albans day  only temperature im interested in right now is his temperature right now  speaklng ln spanlsh  open up  speaklng ln spanlsh  okay let me clarify open up and keep it open  yeah okay  under your tongue  youre using your left hand  right one hurt no i feel better  what it really doesnt hurt  or you just figure if you say no  youll get out of the hospital sooner  it doesnt hurt i feel good  snlfflng  you dont smell too hot  groanlng  your hand is starting to rot  house why are we here  we are talking about cutting off a kids hand  yes were talking about cutting it off  not subdividing it and putting in condos  its not a legal issue are you being intentionally dense  i think its premature  ive heard enough what  she says one word and you take her side  you should at least wait until she actually gives a medical reason  otherwise i might take it personally shut up  if i were to somehow find out that you two were in disagreement  over the proper medical course of action  it could make it awkward for my client in court  my client being the two of you so guys im a little busy here  why dont we pick this conversation up in half an hour  okay  all of his symptoms are caused by his underlying problem  and the medicine we gave him  what underlying problem  you have no idea what the underlying problem is  youre the diagnostician fine its all my fault  does that make you feel better  his hand still has an arterial pulse  his hand is a cesspool and the crap is spreading  you are being pretty aggressive about destroying a mans livelihood  i dont give a damn about his livelihood  he loses that hand he loses his job all of his jobs  hes not like us cant work as a cripple  he loses his home  his kid brother drops out an american dream destroyed  very sad very emotional  not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale  you have lost perspective cuddy  youve stopped looking at this as a doctor  youre acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof  you wanna make things right too bad nothings ever right  i am happy to report that were now so in sync  were actually wearing each others underwear  chopchop time  is this true house no im lying  its stupid to do it with her in the room i guess  this is a big decision we made it  we should convene a meeting of the ethics committee  no  look she is making a medical decision based on never wanting to feel regret  youre making a legal decision based on wanting me to be wrong  greg you have a history of aggressive  you wanted superficial agreement  you wanted everybodys asses covered you got it  now can i do the surgery pretty pretty please  lisa  are you sure youre okay with this  i should be the one to tell the family  your hand is dying  the bacteria are eating it  when they run out of food there they go somewhere else  if you cut off my hand ill be cured  unfortunately no  we still have to find the disease thats making you sick to begin with  but you wont die of gangrene while were looking  sobblng  i quit school when i am 1 2 to get a job  to help my family  i know i never get a good job  never save money or own my own house like you  but manny hes smart  hes the best in his class  well maybe manny doesnt have to quit school maybe you can  are you sure i need to do this  yes  okay  sobblng okay  lulsa slnglng ln spanlsh  lulsa hummlng  i gave one of my clinic patients a followup call  your name came up  im guessing an old black guy  who thinks the cla invented rap music to make your people want to kill each other  he said you gave him the white folks stuff  this is exactly why black people dont live as long  this isnt about race unless annoying is a race  is he not getting better hes fine so far  im calling him back in im getting him on the right stuff  relax foreman he already is  i told him it was the white stuff i gave him the black stuff  he was right  you did exactly what white people do  you figure we dont need to know the truth or cant understand it  so you just lie to us  just a white lie good one massa  right and im a racist  too bad that idiot will never know for the rest of his long long life  every slave master thought they were doing the black man a favor  negro cant take care of himself so well put him to work  well give him four walls a bed  well civilize the heathen  ill tell you what stop doing us favors  if youre right and we end up back in the jungle  with lousy blood pressure medicine  it wont be on your head  you okay  you wondering if you made the right call  ive wanted to be a doctor from the time i was 1 2  i wanted to be a lawyer from the time i was six  until my second week of law school  sorry your story  i graduated medical school at 25 pissed off that i was second in my class  chief of medicine at 32 second youngest ever first woman  sad story  if i had been alfredos doctor  you are his doctor  i insisted on giving him protein c we had to cut his skull open  i insisted on amphotericin killed his kidneys  i missed the pneumonia completely  i would have searched his home and ignored mine  i would have watched him die trying to save his hand  if i didnt have house looking over my shoulder  are you saying youre not as good a doctor as house is  im saying house is right  i was so anxious to get ahead  i havent been a doctor in years  his little finger is dusky  yeah thats why were doing this  no i mean the other hand the one we havent chopped off yet  cuddy hjs o2 sats are down to 88  his lungs are giving out he needs a ventilator  and dialysis  youre getting distracted by the multisystem organ failure  pinkies are supposed to be pink right  i mean theyre not called grayies  but the organ failure is gonna kill him  but the pinky is weirder  what does it tell us  the same thing the right hand told us before we cut it off  its the same symptom house but at a different time  his blood work indicates mild dlc  what if its mild in the way that when you get out of the ocean  the water clinging to your body makes the sea level drop  its technically true but its completely irrelevant  a lack of dlc would explain everything  if there were also a lack of anything to explain  endocarditis his hearts infected  little bacteria cauliflowers clinging to his valves  except sometimes they cant hold on they go swimming in his bloodstream  thursday one breaks off goes to his right hand  black fingers gangrene  fridays child heads for the kidneys  and we all know what saturdays are all about  party with the left hand  also explains the fever  its perfect except for the little fact  that we already tested for endocarditis  and he was negative  which means he either is negative or  what infection can cause pneumonia and culturenegative endocarditis  prize value goes down with every clue  cawlng  youre thinking psittacosis  alfredo doesnt have any pet parrots  quit your squawking give him doxycycline  no thatll just make his clotting problem worse  i liked you better when you were coming up with wacky drugs for us to try  we give him the doxy now damn it maybe we can save his pinky  he can teach his brother to count all the way to five  if youre wrong hell end up with no hands and no feet  technically if im wrong hell end up dead but i take your point  whats his night job he cleans up at some fast food joint  what you think he got it from a chicken nugget  since when do fast food joints allow 1 2yearolds to mop floors  alfredo is 20 really looks younger  where were you going to work tonight  what job do you do on saturday nights  cuddy what are you doing wake him up  we just cut off his hand  yeah we need to talk about it its not happening  speaklng ln spanlsh  honest ive got no idea what i just said  why didnt you say you spoke spanish  well because shed wanna talk to me  or something like that  speaklng ln spanlsh  she says he doesnt work saturday nights  give me the talking juice  the fact it doesnt fit your theory doesnt make it a lie  when she was out of the room  the kid brother insisted he was gonna cover for alfredo at work tonight  speaklng ln spanlsh  saturday nights he goes dancing  either its a lie or hes dancing with birds  give her the talking juice  she doesnt know what youre talking about  odds are its gonna be close to his house  its probably an abandoned warehouse or factory  take the scooby gang and spread out  what the hell are we looking for  find somebody who looks like crap  tell him you want to place a bet  speaklng ln spanlsh  spanlsh muslc playlng  people shoutlng  cell phone rlnglng  its cuddy  i already put him on the psittacosis meds  as soon as you left  youre welcome  what do you think the record for onehanded juggling is  you can yoyo onehanded  good point  alfredo i always wash my hands  if a bird is infected you can get psittacosis just from breathing his dust  but then why do i get sick and nobody else  your asthma made you vulnerable  youre gonna be all right now yes  speaklng ln spanlsh  for saving my life  he thanked me  he should have we cut off his hand  if wed figured it out earlier  if youd figured it out later hed be dead  i never figured it out at all  hello what do you want house  if youre wallowing in selfloathing ive got something that might help  were getting sued  you saved his life he admitted that well settle  hes got a stub where his hand used to be we have insurance  case seems pretty solid to me  the new american dream happy ending  kids gonna be just fine  cuddy  your guilt  its perverse and it makes you a crappy doctor  it also makes you okay at what you do  you figure a perverted sense of guilt makes me a good boss  now would the world be a better place if people never felt guilty  makes sex better  you should have seen her in the last months of our relationship  a lot of guilt a lot of screaming  i know this wasnt just because it was your roof  cuddy  you see the world as it is and you see the world as it could be  and what you dont see is what everybody else sees  the giant gaping chasm in between  house im not naive  i realize if you did you never would have hired me  youre not happy unless things are just right  which means two things  that youre a good boss and youll never be happy  by the way why does everybody think you and i had sex  you think there could be something to it  wllson cuddy feels guilty about not diagnosing psittacosis any earlier  i think so  theres no way she could have  no  no way she could have  slow rock muslc playlng  its raining
