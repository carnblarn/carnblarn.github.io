                its all about the tongue man you stick it in their mouth  but not all the way  they like that dude they love it  what are you doing climbing  just deep enough to lick her teeth slow one at a time like youre painting them  this girl rachel shes a junior   shes experienced  mom says i gotta be home by 500  just chill okay and hop the fence before someone sees you  are you sure this

tired  come on sweetie youve had a fever for almost a week now     ow  oh my god  oh gabe are you okay  are you okay baby whats wrong   im dying     twelveyearold male spiking fever congested chest  coughing up green sputum pain in breathing  baffling though i vaguely recall a disease called meunomia pneumania  but his chest xray and ct scan show an atypical pattern for pneumonia pneumonia thats it  just a guess here but his parents big donors  no infiltrate just enlarged hilar lymph nodes  tiny unicorns goring his bronchial tubes would be cooler  and the way youre ignoring the question wow theyre extremely big donors  hes not responding to cefuroxime his pulse ox is dropping much faster than it should for pneumonia  and plus hes got an odd little rash  excessive irritation hes 12 hes on autostroke on his arm  papular lesion one centimeter on top of a long thin scab  ah you need a dermatologist if its dry keep it wet if its wet keep it dry  if its not supposed to be there cut it off i never could master all that  there you are  were you scared its okay youre home now  fine  cuddy   as a special favor to you  no admit it i got you with the rash  the rash is a total snooze unless its connected to the pneumonia  then its party time  purulent sputum dyspnea rhonchi bilaterally  what kind of pneumonia causes this kind of rash legionnaires disease  usually means industrial ventilation systems convention centers hes 12 years old  send off a urine antigen and check if hes joined the elks next   fungal  excellent maybe the lodge went spelunking   chlamydia pneumonia  twelveyearolds dont have sex  their mistake   thats it other possibilities   what if were thinking about this backwards  the rash came first caused the pneumonia nice  rickettsial tick bite nymphal ticks are out now theyre bloodthirsty little bastards   rash would be more pustular  not always and theres only one rash which fits   new jersey its most likely lyme disease  all right lets keep him on fluids  and the cefuroxime to be safe  biopsy that rash  and take another history even if we dont learn whats causing this  we definitely need to know if twelveyearolds are getting any action   what are you doing now  were collecting fluids from the rash  why they know what theyre doing jeffrey  oh great endorsement coming from the woman who thought it was a nasty cold if i had had him last week  this isnt helping  were checking to see if your son has a tick bite  gabe have you been camping recently playing sports outside anything like that  im not that good at sports   no hanging out anywhere new strange places  weve been through this   we dont let him run wild through the neighborhood right    okay this might be a bit delicate   we need to know if youre sexually active  i beg your pardon   mr reilich we need to  no  nothing like that     weve gotta get another ct scan check his lungs again   third floor right  yeah radiology is  sorry medical personnel only  wheres the machine well we passed it actually  a little tension in the room back there thought you could use a break  your dads a pretty highpowered guy  yeah he was an air force test pilot real top gun stuff  flew mach 3  hard to deal with sometimes  guess im more like my mom listen  i promise to keep my mouth shut but i need to know  you definitely havent had any sexual contact of any kind  i wish   you know what  girls like the cool guys now but give it a few years  they start liking the smart guys   youll be all right    can you keep a secret  i have to its my job  im cursed im not kidding  this seance thing the kids did it spelled out my name  said i was gonna die  first name and last name weve got a gabe upstairs whos very old very sick  no its me i have the worst luck  one time i broke this mirror   the next week my parents got separated  my parents split up too  every kid feels like its his fault it never is  so what about the rest of the stuff any playing outside your parents dont know about  anything like that  maybe you were somewhere you werent supposed to be   triage nurse pick up line 274  oh man  gabe its important  a secret club whats the secret theyre all morons  he fell on something in the attic scraped his arm got the rash the next day  said it smelled really moldy up there    fungal pneumonia without the cave clever  im gonna get a sample  dr chase you have a few moments  sorry ive gotta go  these young doctors its like they dont care about people   no manners  my fault probably  thats an interesting accent you have there id say czech  with about 30 years of aussie  you have quite an ear  youre chases dad  hard to missyou know the big hug and how happy he was to see you  need a consult with a patient  urgent doctor stuff  twentysixyearold male sudden loss of the ability to speak  just because you got out of clinic duty doesnt mean everybody did to his father  differential diagnosis chase  dad swoops in chase swoops out  dad say why he was here see you asked  dad comes 5000 miles youre more curious than junior is   cantjust be about the divorce  its been 15 years and moms been dead for 10 of them you think daddy murdered her  you want to get to the bottom of this youre doing it exactly right  dont talk to the people involved drag your buddy away from work for some pointless speculation  you want to know how two chemicals interact do you ask them  no theyre gonna lie through their lying little chemical teeth  throw them in a beaker and apply heat  even i dont like you  you know words can hurt    whoa whoa whoa hold on guys i dont care that youre up here   you a cop  doctor im treating gabe reilich   he said he fell over near some pipes  yeah over there   what here  yeah   any of you guys been feeling sick lately rash cold anything   no       oh crap he is a cop damn it    he fell on it some weird kind of insulation  its old house was built in the 60s  whats it made of felt fibers ofwhat cotton    sorry forgotten how funny your dad was   not as funny as you   high praise  i know how protective kids can be of their parents  not cotton animal hair  get me the ct scan  first find the name of the company that made the insulation  and second tell me what im seeing that makes me want to short their stock   uh enlarged hilar lymph nodes    peribronchial thickening  pleural effusions  less obvious more scary  well the mediastinum doesnt look right  slightly widened   oh god  it can be transmitted through infected animal hair  but the grams stain would have shown no the cefuroxime would have killed some of it clouded the result  weve gotta get this kid on levaquin  what does he have  anthrax this house belong to old man hussein  maybe he is cursed      anthrax so whatyou think there were terrorists in that attic  its a naturally occurring bacteria   we believe it was in the insulation  how sick is he  anthrax is very dangerous but weve caught it early hes on levaquin its the best antibiotic we have  lisa you buy this jeff youve helped our hospital a lot  i wouldnt have assigned dr house to your case if i didnt have every confidence in him   then whos this guy  jeffrey  theres all these weird diseases that can cause a rash what about leishmaniasis or filariasis  whered you hear about those internet i did some research  well those are very rare conditions oh and anthrax grows along the interstate  leishmaniasis doesnt cause pneumonia and filariasis  just look into everything this is my son all right  and im gonna stay on top of you until i know hes safe i wouldnt expect anything else  everyones a doctor         breathe baby its okay breathe i need you to breathe  his breathing  its on the inhale  what does that mean it means his airways closing up   is the anthrax doin it  all right hold still gabe this is gonna be a little uncomfortable        weve got you its okay   nodules in his throat  airways occluded   weve got to intubate ativan   pushing 3 ccs     airways too tight  whats wrong whats wrong no youre killing him   jeffrey let them do their job  airways too tight get me a smaller tube   were traching  smaller tube   his lips are cyanotic  hes not breathing  foreman were traching no i can do it ill get it   foreman youre not getting through   hes not getting air   we have to trach him right now  no i can do it   betadine  im doing this  got it    hes okay    allergic reaction to the antibiotics  i dont think so we switched him to rifampin and there was no change in the swelling  we should try another antibiotic you really think hes allergic to two antibiotics  i wanna know what dr chase thinks  its possible hes allergic oh im sorry not you  understandable mistake the other dr chase  boy gets anthrax and happens to be allergic to two antibiotics  hate to step on anybodys toes but is it possible your guys got this one wrong  the rash is classic anthrax except the color  the rash hasnt turned black yet no necrosis no anthrax  necrosis can theoretically take as long as two weeks  whoa whoa whoa  guys its not a competition its a diagnosis  okay who thinks junior wins  four to one its not anthrax  so we start over whats changed what do the nodules tell us   sarcoidosis  excellent send an ace level  if it comes back positive put him on methotrexate   we ran some tests and the results point toward sarcoidosis  it makes the bodys tissues swell up  it seems to have gone after gabriels skin and lungs and given him this fever    doctor    we dont know what causes it  but youre sure he has this one we have a worldrenowned doctor consulting   hes convinced this is sarcoidosis  is it treatable  very actually see this is iv methotrexate its an antiinflammatory  it should make all the swelling go down and uh get you all better  stop  my god its black  necrosis  its definitely anthrax and it definitely cant be anthrax it doesnt cause throat nodules  only explanation is this kids got anthrax and sarcoidosis  right two incredibly rare diseases   just happening to strike at once  unless youve got a better theory  anthrax plus an allergic reaction  call the lancet because thats one bizarre allergic reaction  come on theres no reason you both cant be wrong  its not allergy but its not coincidence either  disease number one set off disease number two   anthrax weakened his immune system   and triggered a dormant sarcoidosis  keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax and start the methotrexate for the sarcoidosis see what happens  fine  better go with him make sure he doesnt snap and hurt somebody  yeah but yyoure treating him for both diseases  were covering all the bases what throw everything against the wall and see what sticks  works for spaghetti           aare you being funny apparently not  you know why i give money to this hospital  its the only way to get attention see this  is this a magic trick cause i am a total david copperfield fan  although i thought that tornado of fire that seemed a little fake pain in the wrist it wont go away for months  six doctors brilliant conclusion is to take it easy i write a check name goes on a plaque  and 48 hours later ive got two mris a bone scan and a diagnosis carpal tunnel  im in surgery that afternoon  fascinating story have you thought of adapting it for the stage   i love my look at me i love my son  i love him more than anything else in the world start paying attention to this case or im gonna make things miserable  go to your sons room not until you get your ass  theres a problem     what is it  i dont know     skin lesions are spreading all over his body  theyre opening up and the fatty tissues are oozing out  hell be septic in a matter of days  death by dermatitis   wheres robert  uh he has clinic duty this morning  no he doesnt i rescheduled you guys so youd be free yeah but he rerescheduled himself  it doesnt hurt yet keep going  you page me  no i dont need you come on  we all need help now and again youre getting a consult   okay weve got new skin lesions bigger and uglier what would cause that  my hand hurts  what if his body worked so hard attacking the anthrax that it started attacking itself   autoimmune  wouldnt present this aggressively   its not likely but it is possible  what in a twelveyearold male   this isnt about me is it  gabes dad found leishmaniasis and filariasis on the internet yesterday   they didnt fit then but now they kind of do  sure  except for the nodules and were not working out of calcutta general   multiple neurofibromatosis  you think this is neurological  the only reason youre thinking autoimmune is because youre a rheumatologist  if you were a proctologist youd think rectal cancer  gotta go with senior   he literally wrote the book on this one  autoimmune is a big universe  it could be anything from scleroderma to churgstrauss  whatever it is we should start him on steroids keep the swelling down  a hundred milligrams of cytoxan it treats most autoimmunes  well give it to him now before the fat starts dripping out his eyeballs  hey my fingers are numb  your watch is on too tight    youre messing with my head your relationship with your dad is messing with your ability to do your job  only because you made my dad part of my job good point  you havent seen him in years he flies across the atlantic to see you pacific   you breeze by him like hes a hare krishna at the airport dont ask why hes in town  its probably a conference  probably  i was hoping to do this through sheer manipulation but if you insist on talking fine talk   what did he do to you  how would you feel if i interfered in your personal life  id hate it thats why i cleverly have no personal life  im gonna biopsy his skin lesions  good thinking prove your dad wrong  thatll solve everything    who extubated him i did  temperatures down two degrees and the swellings almost gone  and his skin looks better too  cytoxan is working   feeling better gabe  yep a lot   dr chase can you and i have a word  your diagnosis is wrong no autoimmune disease  the swellings probably just down because weve got him on steroids its masking whatevers really wrong  anas are unreliable phospholipid antibodies are negative so no lupus same for churgstrauss  youre arguing with a rheumatologist  theres about 20 distinct autoimmune diseases why are you here  sle conference  you were in new york last year for the scleroderma conference i didnt hear anything from you  just wanted to say hi this time you said it youre still here  i miss you  i was 15 years old when you walked out now youre walking back in  i left your mother i didnt leave you  mum was living on gin and tonics how was i supposed to take care of her she wasnt your responsibility  i know she was yours  im sorry she died im sorry you had to deal with that  but she was falling apart long before  ive got to talk to house about this treatment  but the patients getting better  in spite of the cytoxan  on the other hand getting better  cytoxan makes him more susceptible to infection  the anthrax could relapse and be more resistant better  you want a negative test for every autoimmune disease known to man   fine ill get em  be home by midnight or you cant have the car this weekend  you guys talk did he tell you why hes here  the sle conference  going back to the conference afternoon panel i hope i can stay awake  i hope you can get in youre not registered  i get it you had to make up a lie  cant just tell your kid youre here to see him  i mean what father does that  that little blue dot under your collar its a tattoo for guiding radiation treatment  i was looking for it after i saw what you had for breakfast brown rice vegetables  its a macrobiotic diet popular with hollywood starlets and cancer patients  lungs stage iv   you look good  im not  came to the states to go to sloankettering and see dr wilson   whatd he say  three months  but you havent told robert  you dont want to burden him because you were such a lousy dad  id prefer you not tell him  yeah thats better  ill get to see his face when he reads his dads obituary  its not your business  i suppose it isnt  you sure do a lot of tests  if we figure out exactly which autoimmune condition it is we can get you better quicker  was that your dad before yeah  thats so cool do you guys work together a lot  not really  when can i go home  well see   looks like you got your appetite back thats a good sign   want some water yes    ah  here you go    whoops thats all right waters cheap   oh god  what  i cant i cant move my hand   can you squeeze my fingers for me gabe   hes getting worse now his entire right hand and forearm are paralyzed  and his fevers back its up over 105 if we dont stop the nerve deterioration quickly hell be paralyzed for life  well luckily at this rate that should only last about a week   okay so  i told you we should get him off the cytoxan  this is toxic neuropathy weve been shoving drugs into his system for a disease he doesnt have   well it could be neurological  what kind of brain process would cause a paralyzed hand  skin lesions and swollen throat nodules  robert was right you said multiple neurofibromatosis  are you saying that for the chance at a beautiful family moment or is there some medicine involved   mmmmm fits better  too bad  i was hoping for the other reason i was gonna go get my camera  get a ct scan his brain this time  youd think three copies would be enough right  ones always been more than enough for me  why didnt you tell me that rowan chase was in to see you  excuse me  ethics confidentiality does any of this ring a bell  you could have covered yourself called me in for a consult it is a juicy piece of gossip  you know what happened i got all focused on his cancer and lost perspective  you cant tell chase but i can what should i do  this is where i give you advice and pretend youre gonna listen to it i like this part  did rowan ask you not to tell i promised i wouldnt  my fingers were crossed though so im wide open  i was wrong this is the musingoutloud part do i actually need to be here telling him  now thats got real entertainment value mm he might even cry  on the other hand there is the dountoothers thingy  well then i should definitely tell him id wanna know you wanna know everything  theres also the keepingyourpromises thingy  oh you never run out of thingies like that blonde thingy you were chatting up  shes the hospital accountant we were going over billing procedures  doubleentry bookkeeping  what are you gonna do  billing procedures theyre so complicated arent they      you know parents are never as bad as kids think they are  if you like my dad so much ask him out  id make an excellent stepmom im very lenient  hes your father you never see him and hes here  unless hes done some unspeakable thing you should lighten up  great thanks for the tip  okay  he beat your mom he beat you  what did he do really dont push it  all this hate its toxic  then stay away    theres nothing there  no masses no fibrous tangles nothing  its not neurofibromatosis  drs chase are 0 for 3 even when they agree theyre wrong  so next what else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules  bergers disease   hes never been out of the country  have his parents they could have brought it back   i dont think so  it doesnt matter his lesions are in the wrong place his feet are the one clear spot   kids dad mentioned leishmaniasis  yeah and filariasis   but the throat nodules still dont fit with that  thats two diseases pretty much exclusive to southeast asia  what if the anthrax didnt set off the second disease   were back at coincidence again  no what if something else was the trigger   nothing else happened  we happened   antibiotics  weve been through this its not an allergy  i gotta pee       what did the ct scan tell you  nothing  ow scale from one to 10 how painful  not half as painful as when i punch you in the face dont do that itll hurt you   carpal tunnel surgery obviously didnt work  who are you  the little ones call me uncle greg your dad never had carpal tunnel  you mentioned two obscure diseases to dr chase how did you know about them   i read about them on the internet  what did you search for  diseases from asia that dont match my sons symptoms   you head about them in asia  ive never been there  well you probably just forgot let me refresh your memory  some remote dusty village close quarters at least a year   starting to come back  im calling dr cuddy  excuse me what does this have to do with our son  your dads pissed off he should be  comes here expecting us to do an extragood job because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital   dont talk to my son like that  just telling him my job and my obligation  stop whats going on  theres only one thing you guys have gotta do  tell the truth or your son will die  how long were you in asia  jeff its a simple question  two years in india  why would you lie about something like that it was 87 and 88  this uh  this guru li thought he had some answers  i went to his ashram  and um ended up with no money and no answers  i was embarrassed i didnt want anyone to know  no  no you were a test pilot  im so sorry gabe  what does this have to do with my son  clue number one if i werejesus curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine  demonic possession close but no wafer  clue number two rheumatology rowan was almost right it causes autoimmune symptoms   leprosy  yeah thats real big in thejersey suburbs  its leprosy run a fite stain itll be positive  daddy hung out on the wrong kind of indian ashram  but its obviously dormant in the dad how could the kid catch it  its not dormant in the dad its just slow  damaged his ulnar nerves was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel  never trust doctors run a fite stain  no wonder he got anthrax the leprosy weakened his immune system  vicious circle the leprosy made him vulnerable to the anthrax  and the anthrax treatment put the leprosy in overdrive   but the antibiotics we gave him they cure leprosy  yeah thats where the trouble starts  the antibiotics hit the nerve strands  they kill the leprosy bacteria and the corpses get tossed into the system  and as fascinating as our bodies are theyre also stupid  they produce antibodies to beat dead bacteria  and these arent the polite antibodies  theyre the ones that wont sit still kick during nap time  they attack his neural and fat cells  causing inflammation and all the rest ofhis symptoms  so the cures killing him  i want you to call down to carville louisiana home of the last leper colony in the lower 48  get em to send up some thalidomide   thalidomide  twelveyearolds dont have sex right so he cant be pregnant  make the call  i need to speak to your boy  hmm  why does everybody need to know my business  people like talking about people  makes us feel superior makes us feel in control  and sometimes for some people knowing some things makes them care  i tell you my dad left my mum drank herself to death you gonna care about me more  cameron would me i just like knowing stuff   i know you hate your dad   now im gonna tell you something  i dont hate him  i loved him until i figured out that it hurts a lot less to just not care  you dont expect him to turn up to your football match no disappointments  you dont expect a call on your birthday dont expect to see him for months no disappointments  you want us to go make up sink a few beers together nice family hug    ive given him enough hugs hes given me enough disappointments  okay   thats it  thats it      breathe    breathe again   breathe again   are you gonna have to tell my friends im a leper  you had the antibiotics youre not contagious anymore   well what if they already caught it  leprosy is incredibly hard to catch even your mum didnt get it  right i want you to make a fist  its still kinda stiff  itll get back to normal in a month or two
