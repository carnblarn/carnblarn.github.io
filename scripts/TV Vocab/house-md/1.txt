                  why are you late youre not going to like the answer  i already know the answer i missed the bus  i dont doubt it no bus stops near brads  you spent the night the alarm didnt work or maybe it did  i didnt sleep with him girl either theres something  i missed the bus  theres something either very wrong with you or something very wrong with him  theres nothing wrong with him please tell me you know that for a fact  melanie i gotta go youre lying arent you  i wouldnt lie to you good morning guys   good morning miss rebecca  everybodys in their seats yes  okay sydney why dont you tell us what you did this weekend   she look  come on sydney we know youre not shy  how come we always have to tell you what we did and you never tell us what you did    okay  i had a really great weekend   but you cant tell miss melanie okay  what did you do  i made a new friend  its so much fun to make new friends isnt it  yeah yeah  did you tell your mom and dad about your new friend  absolutely  you should never keep anything from your parents   and i told mine        wha      ca ba  ha ba cra  ca l  h e the  we know that word the         twentynineyear old female first seizure one month ago  lost the ability to speak babbled like a baby  progressive deterioration of mental status  you see that they all assume im a patient because of this cane  so put on a white coat like the rest of us i dont want them to think im a doctor  you see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude  people dont want a sick doctor  thats fair enough i dont like healthy patients  the 29year old female the one who cant talk i like that part  shes my cousin  and your cousin doesnt like the diagnosis  i wouldnt either  brain tumor shes going to die boring  no wonder youre such a renowned diagnostician  you dont need to actually know anything to figure out whats wrong  youre the oncologist im just a lowly infectious disease guy  yes just a simple country doctor  brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely  shes 29 whatever shes got is highly unlikely  the protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative  thats an hmo lab might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set  no family history  i thought your uncle died of cancer  other side no environmental factors that you know of  and shes not responding to radiation treatment  none of which is even close to dispositive  all it does is raise one question your cousin goes to an hmo  come on why leave all the fun for the coroner  whats the point of putting together a team if youre not gonna use them  youve got three overqualified doctors working for you getting bored   its a lesion  and the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map  is an island  i was hoping for something a bit more creative  shouldnt we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing   is she a doctor  no but   everybody lies  dr house doesnt like dealing with patients  isnt treating patients why we became doctors  no treating illnesses is why we became doctors  treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable  so youre trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine  if we dont talk to them they cant lie to us and we cant lie to them  humanitys overrated   i dont think its a tumor  first year medical school if you hear hoofbeats you think horses not zebras  are you in first year medical school  no first of all theres nothing on the cat scan  second of all if this is a horse  then her kindly family doctor in trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office  differential diagnosis people  if its not a tumor what are the suspects why couldnt she talk  aneurysm stroke or some other ischemic syndrome   get her a contrast mri  creutzfeldtjakob disease   mad cow  mad zebra  wernickes encephalopathy  no blood thiamine level was normal  the lab in trenton could have screwed up the blood tests  i assume its a corollary ifpeople lie that people screw up  redraw the blood tests and get her scheduled for that contrast mri asap  lets find out what kind of zebra were treating here   radiology please call the page  radiology please call the page  i was expecting you in my office  really well thats odd because i had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago  you think we have nothing to talk about no i just cant think of anything id be interested in  i sign your paychecks i have tenure  are you gonna grab my cane now stop me from leaving that would be juvenile  i can still fire you if youre not doing your job im here from 900 to 500  your billings are practically nonexistent rough year  you ignore requests for consults i call back sometimes i misdial  youre six years behind on your obligations to the clinic  see i was right this doesnt interest me  six years times three weeks you owe me better than four months  its 500 im going home  to what  nice  look dr house the only reason why i dont fire you  is because your reputation is still worth something to this hospital  excellent we have a point of agreement youre not gonna fire me  your reputation wont last if you dont do your job  the clinic is part of your job i want you to do your job  but as the philosopherjagger once said you cant always get what you want  youre not my doctor are you dr house  thankfully no im dr chase  dr house is the head of diagnostic medicine  hes very busy but he has taken a keen interest in your case  we inject gadolinium into a vein  it distributes itself throughout your brain and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imager  basically whatevers in your head lights up like a christmas tree   it might make you feel a little lightheaded  dr cameron  im sorry i have to stop you there is a problem  you pulled my authorization  yes why are you yelling  no mris no imaging studies no labs  you also cant make long distance phone calls   if youre going to fire me have the guts to face me  or photocopies youre still yelling  im angry youre risking a patients life   i assume those are two separate points  you showed me disrespect  you embarrassed me and as long as i work here you have no legal  is the yelling designed to scare me  because im not sure what it is im supposed to be scared of more yelling  thats not scary  that youre going to hurt me thats scary but im pretty sure i can outrun you  oh i looked into that philosopher you quotedjagger  and youre right you cant always get what you want  but as it turns out if you try sometimes you get what you need  so because you want me to treat patients  youre not letting me treat patients  i need you to do your job    do the mri she folded  ive got to do four hours a week in this clinic until i make up the time ive missed  ill be caught up in 2054  you better love this cousin a whole lot  all right rebecca i know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there  but we need you to remain still   okay were going to begin      i dont feel so good   its all right just try to relax      rebecca    rebecca  rebecca  get her out of there oh she probably fell asleep  shes exhausted she was claustrophobic   shes not sleeping we gotta get her out of there  itll just be another minute  if shes having an allergic reaction to the gadolinium shell be dead in two minutes  hold her neck all right  oh shes ashen  shes not breathing epi 5   come on  i cant ventilate   too much edema wheres the surgical airway kit   yep coming  good call    well get that tube out of your throat later today  just get some rest for now okay  told you you cant trust people  she probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium  figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat  cant get a picture gonna have to get a thousand words  you actually want me to talk to the patient get a history  we need to know if theres some genetic or environmental cause thats triggering an inflammatory response  i thought everybody lied  truth begins in lies  think about it  that doesnt mean anything does it  please write that down  do you have cable tv here somewhere  general hospital starts in eight minutes  no tv but weve got patients  cant you give out the aspirin yourself ill do paperwork  i made sure your first case was an interesting one cough just wont go away  runny nose looks a funny color patient admitted complaining of back spasms  oh i think i read about something like that in the new england journal of medicine patient is orange  the color no the fruit  you mean yellow its jaundice i mean orange  well how orange its probably exam room one   dr kahn youre needed in pediatrics  i was playing golf and my cleats got stuck it hurt a little but i kept playing  the next morning i could barely stand up  well youre smiling so i take it that means this isnt serious  whats that what are you doing  painkillers  oh for you for your leg no cause theyre yummy  you want one make your back feel better  unfortunately you have a deeper problem  your wife is having an affair   what  youre orange you moron  its one thing for you not to notice  but if your wife hasnt picked up on the fact that her husband has changed colors shes just not paying attention  by the way do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and megadose vitamins  carrots turn you yellow the niacin turns you red find some finger paint and do the math  and get a good lawyer    deep breath  its cold  hes been using his inhaler  not in the past few days hes um only 10  i worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently  what happened to your leg  your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine too  she probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing  oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years dont you think  okay im gonna assume nobody has ever told you what asthma is  or if they have you had other things on your mind  a stimulant triggers cells in your childs airways  to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract  mucus production increases the cell lining starts to shed   but the steroids    the steroids stop the inflammation  the more often this happens  what the more often this happens what  forget it if you dont trust steroids you shouldnt trust doctors   my mother passed away four years ago  she had a heart attack and my father broke his back doing construction     its house its urgent im sorry  you couldnt have knocked  steroids give her steroids high doses of prednisone  youre looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis  inflammation of blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare especially for someone her age   so is a tumor her sed rate is elevated  mildly  that could mean anything or nothing  yeah i know i have no reason to think that its vasculitis  except that it could be  if the blood vessels are inflamed thats gonna look exactly like what we saw on the mri from trenton county  and the pressure is gonna cause neurological symptoms   we cant diagnose that without a biopsy  yes we can  we treat her if she gets better we know were right   and if were wrong  then we learn something else  why steroids  just part of your treatment  you havent had many visitors  no boyfriend three dates  i wouldnt have stood by him if he were vomiting all day  what about work you must have friends from work  pretty much everybody i like is five years old  the nurse said youre stopping my radiation  were just trying some alternative medication  so wheres your family from then steroids arent an alternative to radiation  the tests werent really conclusive  were treating you for vasculitis  its the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain  lits not a tumor  i dont have a tumor  you should have told her the truth its a long shot guess  thank you if house is right no harm  if hes wrong ive given a dying woman a couple days hope  false hope if there was any other type available i would have given her that    why are you smelling billys pants  im not looked like you were   i was smelling the floor  oh  do you have any pets in this class  no but we used to have a gerbil but carly l dropped a book on it  careless   do you need to smell it  no im smelling for mold  i dont need to smell it   you could smell our parrot  you said you didnt have any pets in this class  a parrot is a bird  listen jacksons not the father   parrots are the primary source of psittacosis  its not the parrot  and psittacosis can lead to nerve problems and neurological complications  how many kids were in the class twenty  how many are home sick none but  none but you figured that fiveyearolds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher  have you been through her home she lives in trenton  i can go up to her room tomorrow morning ask her for the key  would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene  its not a crime scene as far as i know shes running a meth lab out of her basement  shes a kindergarten teacher and if i were a kindergarten student i would trust her implicitly   okay ill give you a for instance  the lady back there  who made your egg salad sandwich  her eyes look glassy did you notice that  now hospital policy is to stay home if youre sick  but if youre making 800 an hour then you kind of need the 800 an hour right  and the sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities  but i figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve isnt hyperconcerned about sanitary conditions  so what do you think should i trust her  i want you to check the patients home for contaminants garbage medication  i cant just break into someones house isnt that how you got into the felkers home  yeah i know  court records are sealed you were 16 it was a stupid mistake  but your old gym teacher has a big mouth should write a thankyou note   i should thank him  well    i needed somebody around here with street smarts  okay who knows when theyre being conned knows how to con  i should sue you  pretty sure you cant sue somebody for wrongful hiring  but im pretty sure i can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some ladys house  doing research people are fascinating arent they  why are you giving adler steroids  because shes my patient thats what you do with patients you give them medicine  you dont prescribe medicine based on guesses  at least we dont since tuskegee and mengele  youre comparing me to a nazi nice  im stopping the treatment  shes my patient its my hospital  i did not get her sick  she is not an experiment i have a legitimate theory about whats wrong with her  with no proof  theres never any proof  five different doctors come up with five different diagnoses based on the same evidence  you dont have any evidence  and nobody knows anything huh then how is it you always think youre right  i dont i just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption  and why are you so afraid of making a mistake  because im a doctor because when we make mistakes people die  oh come on  people used to have more respect for cripples you know  they didnt really  so how you feeling much better thanks  are you dr house i thought he was a he but  no  dont eat too much too fast  thank him for me  right  should i discontinue the treatment boss  you got lucky  cool huh  okay once again    good  am i ever gonna meet dr house   well you might run into him at the movies or on the bus  is he a good man  hes a good doctor  can you be one without the other  dont you have to care about people caring is a good motivator  hes found something else  feel this both sides mmhmm mmhmm  okay squeeze harder all right  hes your friend huh  yeah  does he care about you  i think so you dont know  as dr house likes to say everybody lies  its not what people say its what they do  yeah he cares about me  i cant see  i cant see    a little help in here    your chest will be sore for a while  we needed to shock you to get your heart going  okay can you arrange these to tell a story   she couldnt put them in order  could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure  no i gave her the same test five minutes later she did just fine  the altered mental status is intermittent just like the verbal skills  so what now  given the latest symptoms its clearly growing deeper into the brain stem  soon she wont be able to walk  shell go blind permanently and then the respiratory center will fail  how long do we have  if its a tumor were talking a month or two if its infectious a few weeks  if its vascular thatll probably be fastest of all maybe a week  were gonna stop all treatment  i still think its a tumor i think we should go back to the radiation   she didnt respond to the radiation  well maybe we didnt see the effect until after we started steroids no its not a tumor  those steroids did something i just dont know what  so were just gonna do nothing were just gonna watch her die  yeah were gonna watch her die specifically were gonna watch how fast shes dying  you just told us each diagnosis has its own time frame  when we see how fast its killing her well know what it is  and by then maybe theres nothing we can do about it  theres got to be something we can do  something better than watching her die  well i got nothing  how about you  bastard  oh cameron i need you for a couple of hours whats up  when you break into someones house its better to have a white chick with you adlers house  why dont we just ask her for her keys for all we know shell be running a meth lab out of her basement  im tired a lot  any other reason why you think you might have chronic fatigue syndrome  its kind of the definition isnt it  its kind of the definition of getting older  i had a couple headaches last month a mild fever sometimes i cant sleep and i have trouble concentrating  apparently not while researching this stuff on the internet  i was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia  excellent diagnosis  is there anything for that   you know i think there just might be  i need 36 vicodin and change for a dollar  exam room two  house doesnt believe in pretense  figures lifes too short and too painful so he just says what he thinks  nothing interesting in the garbage  i say what i think is just another way of saying im an assho  well if you wanted to be judged for your medical prowess only  maybe you shouldnt have broken into someones home  i was 16  dont know about ticks but her dogs definitely got fleas  i managed to make it to 17 without a criminal record  yeah  well you obviously didnt grow up in my neighborhood  thats right you stole a loaf of bread to feed your starving family right  you always eat during breakins  am i supposed to respect their food more than i respect their dvd players  you want some no  you gonna go hungry until she dies  no you know what  after centuries of slavery decades of civil rights marches  and more significantly living like a monk never getting less than a 40 gpa  you dont think its kind of disgusting i get one of the top jobs in the country because im a delinquent  well eat then well tear up the carpet  you went to hopkins right  yep  so you went to a better school than i did you got better grades than i did   so how did you get the job  you stab a guy in a bar fight   nothing  its not a tumor shes getting worse too fast   she cant stand up  no toxins no medications  nothing that would explain these symptoms  family history of neurological problems  not that i could tell from her underwear drawer  you said nothing that would explain these symptoms  what did you find that doesnt explain these symptoms  dr wilson convinced you to treat this patient under false pretenses  adlers not his cousin  thats ridiculous ask her yourself can we get ba   shes notjewish  rachel adlers notjewish   i had ham at her apartment    dr foreman a lot ofjews have nonjewish relatives and most of us dont keep kosher  i can see getting through high school without learning a thing aboutjews but medical school  okay maybe shes jewish but shes definitely not your cousin  really this guy is   you dont even know her name you called her rachel her name is rebecca  yes yes her name is rebecca  li call her rachel  you idiot  listen hes  not you him   you said you didnt find anything  everything i found was in my   you found ham  so  where theres ham theres pork  where theres pork theres neurocysticercosis  tapeworm you think shes got a worm in her brain  it fits could have been living there for years never occurred to me that  millions of people eat ham every day its quite a leap to think thats shes got a tapeworm  okay mr neurologist what happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm  they they get a little better andand then they get worse  just like rebecca adler did  in a typical case if you dont cook pork well enough  you digest live tapeworm larvae  theyve got these little hooks  they grab onto your bowel they live they grow up they reproduce  reproduce theres only one lesion and its nowhere near her bowel  thats because this is not a typical case  tapeworm can produce  guess where they go  out  not all of them  unlike the larvae the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines into the bloodstream  and where does the bloodstream go  everywhere  as long as its healthy the immune system doesnt even know its there  the worm builds a wall uses secretions to shut down the bodys immune response and control fluid flow  its really very beautiful  as long as its healthy so what do we do  call a vet nurse the little guy back to health  its too late for that its dying  and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control the hosts defenses  the immune system wakes up attacks the worm and everything starts to swell  and that is very bad for the brain  it could still be a hundred other things  the eosinophil count was normal   its only abnormal in 30 of cases  proving nothing  no no no no it dont you see it fits its perfect it explains everything   but it proves nothing  i can prove it by treating it  no you cant  i was just with her she doesnt want any more treatments  she doesnt want any more experiments she wants to go home and die      would you excuse us please  im dr house  its good to meet you  youre being an idiot   you have a tapeworm in your brain  its not pleasant but if we dont do anything youll be dead by the weekend  have you actually seen the worm  when youre all better ill show you my diplomas  you were sure i had vasculitis too  now i cant walk and im wearing a diaper  whats this treatment gonna do for me  im not talking about a treatment im talking about a cure  but because i might be wrong you want to die  what made you a cripple  i had an infarction  a heart attack  its what happens when blood flow is obstructed  if its in the heart its a heart attack if its in the lungs its a pulmonary embolism  if its in the brain its a stroke i had it in my thigh muscles  wasnt there something they could do  there was plenty they could do if theyd made the right diagnosis  but the only symptom was pain  not many people get to experience muscle death  did you think you were dying  i hoped i was dying  so you hide in your office refuse to see patients  because you dont like the way people look at you  you feel cheated by life so now youre gonna get even with the world  but you want me to fight this  why  what makes you think im so much better than you  what youre scared youll turn into me  i just want to die with a little dignity  theres no such thing  our bodies break down sometimes when were 90 sometimes before were even born  but it always happens and theres never any dignity in it  i dont care if you can walk see wipe your own ass its always ugly always  we can live with dignity we cant die with it  no treatment  maybe we can get a court order uh override her wishes  claim she doesnt have the capacity to make this decision  but she does  but we could claim that the illness made her mentally incompetent right  a pretty common result that didnt happen here  hes not gonna do it shes notjust a file to him anymore  he respects her  so because you respect her youre going to let her die  i solved the case my work is done  patients always want proof  were not making cars here  we dont give guarantees  i think we can prove its a worm  its noninvasive its safe  im not completely sure but yeah yeah yeah whats the damn idea  have you ever seen a worm under an xray  a regular old nocontrast hundredyearoldtechnology xray  they light up like shotgun pellets just like on a contrast mri  which is the same thing as a ct scan which we did which proved nothing  the worms cyst is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid  were not gonna see anything in her head  but chase is right hes right we should xray her  but we dont xray her brain we xray her leg  worms love thigh muscle if shes got one in her head i guarantee you theres one in her leg  hold still rebecca  this here  is a worm larva  so if its in my leg its in my brain  are you looking for a guarantee  its there probably been there six to 10 years   do i have more  probably  its good news   what do we do now  now we get you better  albendazole   two pills  yeah every day for at least a month with a meal   two pills  yeah  possible side effects include abdominal pain nausea headaches dizziness fever  and hair loss  well probably make you keep taking the pills even if you get every one of those  why did you hire me   does it matter  kinda hard to work for a guy who doesnt respect you   why  is that rhetorical  no it just seems that way cause you cant think of an answer  does it make a difference what i think  im a jerk the only thing that matters is what you think can you do the job  you hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record no  it wasnt a racial thing  i didnt see a black guy  i just saw a doctor  with a juvenile record  i hired chase cause his dad made a phone call  i hired you  because you are extremely pretty  you hired me to get into my pants i cant believe that that would shock you  its also not what i said  no i hired you because you look good  its like having a nice piece of art in the lobby   i was in the top of my class  but not the top  i did an internship at the mayo clinic yeah you were a very good applicant  but not the best would that upset you really  to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty instead of some genetic gift of intelligence  i worked very hard to get where i am  but you didnt have to  people choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort  thats a law of nature and you defied it thats why i hired you  you could have married rich you could have been a model  you could havejust shown up and people would have given you stuff lots of stuff  but you didnt you worked your stunning little ass off  am i supposed to be flattered  gorgeous women do not go to medical school  unless theyre as damaged as they are beautiful  were you abused by a family member   no  sexually assaulted  no  but you are damaged arent you      i have to go  i followed her   oh  i couldnt stop thinking about what that doctor said   i told you not to listen to him hes an idiot  i was orange   i dont want to know what you found out  you dont care  im your doctor  youve been good to me and good to this hospital of course i care  but i dont see how this conversation can end well for me  either your wife is having an affair or shes not having an affair  and you have come here because you rightly think i should fire him  but i cant even if it costs me your money  the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have  feeling any better  i cant complain  as you know the hospital has certain rules  and as you also know we tend to ignore them  but i think this ones gonna be a little obvious unless we get your help  if anyone asks you have 11 daughters and five sons   hi look whos here    its so good to see you guys i missed you  is this for me  its beautiful  oh i love you guys  i wanted to thank dr house but he never visited again  he cured you you didnt cure him  okay i want a hug and a kiss from every single one of you get up here right now    there   hold on   shes converted    you said she was your cousin  why would you lie  it got you to take the case  you lied to a friend to save a stranger you dont think thats kind of screwed up  youve never lied to me  i never lie  oh right    why do we do this   because were doctors  if we make mistakes people die     dr house  you have a patient     he says he needs a refill  got change for a dollar  thats some bad hat harry
