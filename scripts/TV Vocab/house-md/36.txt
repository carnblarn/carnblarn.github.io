                two spades  three hearts  its all yours  i fold  and thats five   and thats six  yay  not bad  on a slam contract you normally want to play your winners early  sorry dad  nah youre learning youre doing fine  woman connie gilmans a good player and a widow  i should uh take her out because she can play bridge  youre a true romantic  woman 2 you should ask somebody out you think

time of your life   one no trump  woman laughing ooh  im justa little nauseous i uh i think i ate too much   can we take a break  of course  excuse us  what did you eat  nothing weird   have you been drinking  no dad you know i dont  because i dont mind if you  dad   dad  dad what are you doing  youre scaring me it hurts let go  what are you doing  man henry  henry let go of her  the occasional drink doesnt bother me but  what  are you okay  whats the matter   original airdate fox  7 march2006  you had whats called an absence seizure  anything like that happen to you before  no nothing  hes been really healthy he jogs he eats right he  iwell i did have a headache last sunday  and for the past two years ive been getting acid reflux a lot  and i thought that uh antacids were all i needed  should i have come in sooner  for acid reflux and a headache  well iyou know i hear the coffee downstairs is really good  could you get me a cup honey  would you mind closing the blinds  foreman his right testicle is almost twice as big as his left  cool  its probably testicular cancer  mmm no thats impossible   the symptoms all indicate  the shoes arent right  heres how testicular cancer would manifest itself  first the patient would get the exact symptoms that hes got  then foreman would examine him  then hed suspect testicular cancer on account of the symptoms being so perfect  then hed stick a needle in it then hed call a surgeon  and while that guy operates the rest of us would be out bowling  and since were not wearing bowling shoes  the disease obviously did not progress in that fashion  lp showed some white cells but his mri is clean  sure if you call a microabscess in his brain clean  what you dont trust me  are you talking about the left temporal lobe  neat you can see through my hand   its just a shadow  or its an infection  when guys have braincrotch problems its usually the result of using one too much and the other too little  blood and urine were negative for syphilis gonorrhea and chlamydia  so treat him for all three stat  umnegative means he doesnt have it  no negative means he probably doesnt have it which means he probably has cancer  i thought we were wearing the wrong shoes for cancer  were wearing the wrong shoes for testicular cancer  theyre perfect for lymphoma  except chases theyre just goofy  lymphoma could cause infiltrants in his reproductive organs and his brain  if its this advanced hes dead no matter what we do  so give him the std meds and hope the tests were wrong  svinnuk  whos the lucky woman  my wife  no i dont want to know who gets the chocolates  i want to know who youre having the affair with  fell on his head as a child tragic  norwegian chocolate  frankly you buy that stuff the terrorists win  some people bottle up their feelings have them come out as physical pain  healthy  human beings express feelings such as affection by giving gifts  gifts express guilt  the more expensive the expression the deeper the guilt thats a 12 box  so either you havent slept with her yet or she wasnt that good  its not all about sex house  really when did that change  i want to get depoprovera  actually at your age as long as youre careful  the risk of you getting pregnant is pretty limited  yeah  but it would calm me down  right if i get a high enough dose  you mean calm as in a peaceful lake on cool summer evening  or in the lesser used meaning of nothing can ever bother you again because life has absolutely no meaning  high dose of depoprovera will chemically castrate you  yeah  okay im gonna get up to leave now  and im gonna walk to that door turn the handle  and then youre suddenly gonna decide that you have to tell me the truth  im gonna have to turn around and come all the way back  see the thing is my leg hurts  can we cut the walking out of the equation  i love cows  any  particularvariety  guernseys holsteins  which are the black and white ones  oh god  i pass a farm on my way to school  and theyre so beautiful  theyre so majestic i dream about them  leather shoes hamburgers how can anybody do that to a cow  make love not belts its beautiful   i havent actually  well relax  something we doctors deal with all the time  im gonna write you the name of a drug  you dont need a prescription and it looks just like depoprovera   but does it do the same thing  oh god no  that stuff has all sorts of nasty side effects its real medicine  no this is all you need  your frat buddies will be completely fooled  tell them how appalled the doctor was  lots of laughs  we think you may have a sexually transmitted disease  no its not possible  sir maybe we should speak in private  have you tested him for this  the tests were negative  well then its not that  so what else could it be  nothing good  if youve been having sex you have to tell me  i have not had sex since my divorce  i didnt ask him to take the medicine  i asked you to give him the medicine  he hasnt had sex in over a year   hes lying  he knows whats at stake  we should start treating him for lymphoma right away   maybe if we hit him hard and fast  wilson  how long can you go without sex  how long can you go without annoying people  no seriously week month  im not having an affair  i didnt say you were not in this conversation  were talking about a patient  people have impulse control we dont need sex  well not like air but as a biological imperative sure we do  theres two things we get stupid for money and sex  and since money rarely enters the bloodstream  was his daughter in the room when you asked if hed had sex  i told him we could talk privately he didnt care if she was there  its almost noon little girl would go to lunch  soon as shes out the door youre gonna get paged then you page me    lunch is early huh  hi  im dr house  i hear youd rather die than admit you had sex  im sorry i couldnt tell my daughter  right cause sheswhat 22  i slept with her mom  she probably knows thats happened already  roll over  my wife had an affair i forgave her  she had another affair and i forgave her again and  amy thinks i was an idiot  so smart you must be very proud roll over  i assume youve been in love  is that the one that makes your pants feel funny  im starting you on a cocktail of std meds  amy is just getting over it  she barely spoke to her mom for months actually  if she thought that it was happening again that thats why i got sick  we just happened to be at the same italian cheesetasting thing  cheese is the devils play thing  it was just the one night  oh youre obviously completely over her  amy thinks love leads you to make stupid choices  youre certainly setting a good example for her  yeah she just doesnt get it  if youre not prepared to look stupid then nothing great is ever gonna happen right  on the other hand i guess your testicles arent going to explode either  dad  is everything okay  i have a sexually transmitted disease  hows that possible  he met a woman in church  does she play bridge   does she haha    crash cart  oh god   is this another seizure  shut up  comin in  amy oh god   here you go  40 milligrams furosemide  knock him out  how would an std do this  it wouldnt  chase it was flash pulmonary edema  we took a liter of fluid off but the problem wasnt with his lungs its his heart  there are vegetations obstructing his mitral valve  its not an std lymphoma wouldnt erupt that suddenly  so what is it then a disease that attacks his brain heart and testicles  i think byron wrote about that  could be psittacosis  chlamydia cultures wouldve come back positive  strep viridans can hit the heart  wouldnt mess with the reproductive system  maybe things arent so nicely connected  hes 65  we could be looking at multiple systems just starting to break down independently  way to a mans heart is through his stomach  hes had acid reflux for years itit cant be relevant  it seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them  you dont need this so much  problem is not your lungs  its your heart  that italian cheese thing at the church  what sort of cheese  why do you need to know  im having a fondue party   was it sheep cheese  might have been why   was it soft  yeah   taste like crap  yeah bitter  taste like this   yeah but how did you  that was regularlowfat american  i added some bacteria for flavor  you fed him bacteria  its pretty much on everything  especially the unpasteurized sheep cheese they make in the alps  that stuff will give you brucellosis  key to a long life exotic women boring cheese  gonna start you on rifampin and doxycycline  doesnt make any sense  i mean nobody else at the church got sick  so much acid in their stomach  they become churning cauldrons of death for all those nasty little brucellosis bugs  but you were taking antacids for your acid reflux  so that turns your digestive tract into a pleasant scenic river for all those bacterial tourists  you sure youre right  absolutely your socks dont match  which means you got up and got dressed in the dark  which means you dont want to wake your wife  which means you dont want to talk to her   which means  i was referring to your patient  oh that no  come on im basing it on cheese  how long before you get the tests back  well know before that if im wrong  hell just keep getting worse and slowly die  but if im right either we caught it in time and he gets better  or we didnt and he goes into cardiac arrest at any moment    paddles  charging   charging 300  clear  charging 360 clear  epinephrine    are you gonna tell her  that you suspect an affair  sure  well she already hates you why not  because you think that getting it off your chest will let you sleep better it wont  youll end up sleeping on my lumpy couch  theres nothing to tell  then why are you playing foosball here at 800 at night  you always want to simplify everything    boil it down to nice easy equations  nice easy answers  go home and have sex with your wife  his heart is back in sinus rhythm theres a lot of damage though  it was brucellosis but we got to it too late  the vegetation broke off in his main coronary artery and caused an infarction  his heart muscles halfdead  hell be lucky to last a week  other than that hows he doing  seriously  his brain testicle lungs tonsils  hows all that other stuff doing  uhhis brain is clear now and so is the genitourinary tract and his kidney function is good  so all he needs is a heart and hes outta here  hes a prime candidate for transplant  he doesnt smoke drinks moderately  his  tox screen was negative for illegal drugs and legal ones  surveillance blood cultures show absolutely no sign of any lingering brucella bacteria  hes 66 years old  he told me he was 65 liar im outta here  there is an inverse correlation between patient age and success rates  hes in excellent health  this was his first hospitalization since breaking his leg at 23  or 22 im not sure anymore  if this patient were to survivethe operation hed get another what  if hes very lucky  so youre saying that old people arent as worth saving as young people  hes saying that hearts are a scarce resource  we obviously have to choose criteria  no i get it women live longer so they should get preference right  and africanamericans they die a lot younger so to hell with them  what you think youre gonna win me over by calling me a racist  if the test is who gets to use it the longest you can either be a racistor a hypocrite  your patient had a life a family  weve got 18yearold kids who will neve  how old are you doctor  when do we get to toss you on an ice flow  cuddy and thank you dr house  unless anybody else has any further questions we will now go into private session  oh im on pins and needles  i wonder how youll decide  the nets just won their third game in a row beat the lakers  im sorry  they voted no  so  w hen  will i die  might have a week    god  i wrote a letter to the board of directors appealing the transplant committees decision  im alleging bias against you clouded their medical judgment  i need you to sign  they made the right call  you dont believe that you told the committee  i was advocating for my patient   then why are you  advocating for my patient  ive got clinic duty  i need you to get me the files on everybody who dies here today  you really think this thingll change their decision  nope  mooooo  i think i broke my ankle  i was kicked by a hoof  im so in love she was so beautiful   which one  one of the black and white ones   im not sure what type  which type which one  i want a name   why would it have a name  well not it she or he  i want to know her dreams her hopes  its a cow  hey im not the one who said he was in love  people who actually have this condition rationalize it they dismiss it they dont elevate it to the level of poetry  plus theres a wooden splinter in there  so either you hit yourself with a twobyfour or elsie has a peg leg  im off duty at 600  give yourself another whack come back and scam somebody else  im sick and youre a doctor you have a duty to help me  technically i dont have to treat anybody  before running a series of painful and often humiliating tests  whatever you need  died of pneumonia  unless she has a bionic heart whats next   umbaby died in the icu  babies are useless  theyve got hearts the size of pingpong balls next  um40yearold male  yes  heart attack  if you really cared about me youd find me a better corpse  theres no other deaths theres one woman who was in a car accident  bad one i hope  the organ procurement people have been notified  give me her file  its in the er theyre still working on her   age  about 40   young damn  young is good   smoker  dont know  find out  shes still alive even if we get on the list we cant go near her until  overweight  shes on the hefty side  excellent our odds just went up  what odds what is this  get tossed in the trash because theres something wrong with them  with fat people its closer to 80  but if her hearts no good then  big fat sloppy heart beats no heart at all   are you mr neuberger  yes  im dr house  need to ask you a few questions about your wife  is she gonna be okay  im afraid i dont know that  could you tell me about her accident  they uh think she fell asleep went off the road thats all they told me  any problems with her health up until now  why  please its important  um  she had a fever today but otherwise she was  how high  about 101  she hasnt missed a day of teaching in years  and i shouldve made her stay home  any other symptoms  a stomachache who cares she was in a car crash   mr neuberger  yeah  my names ellen stambler im the organ procurement coordinator for southern new jersey  i just want to assure you that well treat her organs with care and dignity  her organs  laura died  iim sorry i thought um  she was just pronounced dead i thought he was telling you  i didnt know  you should never make assumptions  what did you want from me  im sorry for your loss  but i need your wifes heart  the organ procurement coordinator just left the hospital  means we got lucky either that or shes getting lunch  dead womans last name have a u or w  youre hacking into a confidential patient file  is that a problem for you  its a u neu  berger  three minutes ago her organs were officially declared not viable  time to go dumpster diving  hey  shes got hepatitis c her alts are three times normal  with henrys immune system down an infected heart will kill him  fortunately she didnt have hep c   she tested positive  her history says otherwise  her husband told me she was running a fever with stomach pains  not symptomatic of hep c  hey what are you doing what are you doing  hey what are you doing  again sorry  but we need to talk  mr neuberger has every right to take his wife off the ventilator  his wife signed an organ donor card  which became invalid when her organs were turned down  i can use them i just need some time  committee says they wont take her heart  another committee says the guy cant have a heart  its a marriage made in heaven  i can find a surgical team that can do this  classified as experimental its not gonna screw with their numbers   this is what she wanted  no  she wanted her organs to help  she never wanted to be kept alive on a ventilator  shes not shes dead  shes not in pain shes not suffering its just her  meat were dealing with here   this is my wife  not anymore  she deserves some respect some dignity   i respect the living  right  that is why you made me think that you were her doctor  made me believe that maybe there was some hope  i never said that i was her doctor  fine you didnt lie but you sure as hell didnt give me any respect  i am taking her off the machines now  nicely played  its not over  excuse me are you mr neuberger  yeah why  im amy arrington  i wanted to thank you  this girls father will die by next weekend unless he gets your wifes heart  house dont you think thats a little manipulative  no its hugely manipulative  youre an ass  hey listen you take your wife off life support  and ill have forgotten about this in two weeks   gail here on the other hand  amy  whatever  youre mad at me fine i get that take it out on me not on her  oof  fine your dad can uh have her heart  fever stomach pain raised liver enzymes  shes sick  worse than that shes dead  my point is even if its not hep c its something  they turned her down as a donor because if we put that heart into someone they wont survive  whatever made her sick will kill him  yeah so what is it  enzymes indicate  you want us to do a differential diagnosis on a dead person  were going to cure her  were going to cure death   doubt it  just want to get the infection out of her heart before we get the heart out of her  the fever indicates an infection  she probably has hep c and a bad case of the flu  lets assume just for fun that the answer is something that might be helpful  fever and belly pain could be a gall bladder infection  like that  do an mri stat  you really dont need to be here  i assume uh house is a great doctor  why would you assume that  because uh when youre that big a jerk youre either great or unemployed  no sign of gall bladder infection but there was a cyst  perfectly round now hep c wouldnt cause  the question was never is it hep c  the question was given that its not hep c what is it   adenoma  not solid enough  cavernous hemangioma  not vascular enough  what if she was sloppy about washing her hands after pooping  uhamoeba infection  if the amebiasis started in her liver then spread to her blood that would explain all her symptoms  except for the crushed skull but im assuming thats from the car crash  ill start her on paromomycin and chloroquine  ten grams each  thats20 times the normal dose  right so well destroy her retinas and damage her hearing  whoever wants those parts is having a very bad day  couple hours on the meds shell be feeling great  got your labs   do you eat guinea pigs  no  how about hamsters or mice  humans  what are you talking about  is something wrong with me  absolutely nothing  your blood work is perfect  youve got lots of vitamins minerals all kinds of proteins  including a little something i like to call bovine serum albumin  which you get from eating the animals mentioned  or cow  you dont really worship cows  so i have to wonder  what could be more humiliating than someone calling your girlfriend a cow and not being metaphorical   nice  its my mom  well either thats a very old photograph or its your stepmom  she goes around the house in a bikini or less  ii cant stop thinking about her  my dads in europe ill be watching tv shell give me a massage  i cant walk for an hour   still cows  shes my mother  step  please  i just need the medicine for three months until i graduate and i move out of the house  please  youre not gonna have any fun at graduation  keep up the good work  your shirt is ironed  that means you havent told your wife anything  lets say youre right  youre saying im right  no let is saying  does it occur to you that maybe theres some deeper guidance than keep your mouth shut  that maybe a friend might value concern over glibness that maybe  maybe im going through something that i need to have an actual conversation about    does it occur to you that if you need that kind of a friend you may have made some deeper errors  chase her heartbeats irregular  looks like global hypokinesis  stop the meds  youre giving up  either were wrong and her heart is unusable  or right but the treatment we had to give her will make her heart unusable  im sorry you can pull the plug now  find me another body  that fat guy on ortho service didnt look so hot  no  shes not ready  you were ready this morning  shes not done  shes gotta save that guy  house alternate theories  amebiasis was our best hope  the fact that her heart rate went back to normal when we stopped the meds pretty much  whats our second best hope  house put down the wand  theres no obstruction  maybe we should just biopsy it  shes a fridge with the power out  we start poking around inside the vegetable goes bad  no offense  i dont see that we have a lot of choice  the only way were gonna find that infection  cameron what if its not an infection  toxins can cause similar symptoms especially if whatever it is did liver damage  her uh toxin screen was clean  those things never cover for any of the really cool toxins  run the screen again for whatever you can think of  you keep the other patient alive  you check out the school  and i seem to need o hire another doctor to go search her home  come on  if she was taking any medications id know about it  did your wife dye her hair  no  her mom never went gray  she didnt either  guess this must be yours then  can you think of anything else she mightve lied to you about  any drugs she gave up when she married you  how are you feeling sir  mr arrington  mr arrington    whats going on  his hearts not pumping enough blood to his brain  were gonna have to give it some help  get the balloon ready  you use this drawer  neuberger no thats for her vitamins  and sleeping pills  she never took sleeping pills  okay  you on a diet  no  i guess you never really know someone do you  quite the insight  she lied to you about her hair color  and didnt want you to know she thought she was fat  unless you never lied to her about anything that huge  and then you can probably let those slide  diet pills couldve messed her up  raised the live enzymes and caused the bellyache  but not the fever  maybe something else set off the fever  like what  before i show you these they were in a locked drawer in her desk  the vice principal said that laura mustve confiscated them theyve had some problems with  neither interesting nor helpful  this at least is interesting   no its not  sex with teenagers isnt interesting where did you grow up  it isnt helpful teenage boys arent toxins  what if the cyst isnt a cyst  then we have nothing to go on  i said its not a cyst i didnt say it was nothing  what if its a scar  foreman fitzhughcurtis syndrome  youre pushing gonorrhea again  you got anything better  test her and start her on ceftriaxone  what are you testing for now  just some more infections  shes positive for gonorrhea  i think thats the first time those words have been uttered in joy  meds are started  her heart should be clear enough to use in about four or five hours  ill go tell the families  hes in a coma  start him on dobutamine  already did  we either do the surgery now or we find him a new brain too  house shes still got a significant amount of gonorrhea in her system  hopefully tomorrow itll be in his system  i need two ors and the transplant team  what is it  amy whats going on   is he getting a heart  yeah excuse me  i assume this means you uh you found out what was wrong with laura  she had a amebiasis  we just found a different way to get rid of it  thank you  that was kind of you  i didnt want him going postal on us  soon as his wifes hearts in our hands you can tell him about the gonorrhea  hes gotta be tested  preferably before he gets any sympathy sex  paddles   charging  charging    lets take him off bypass  mr neuberger theres something i need to tell you  the last uh  year or so uh  laura was kind of distant with me  i dont know why  i thought maybe she was having an affair  butnot laura and im not excusing myself  but when i was traveling during christmas i had a  i had a onenight stand  i got gonorrhea   are you sure  yeah  i shouldve said something to you  but i didnt want to believe that i gave it to her  thats what made her sickand  that was why she got into the accident  cecile  am i dead  hopefully not for a long time  why are you here  amy called me  if you do mom again you gotta wear a condom  youre gonna have gonorrhea in your system for a while  honky tonk women  by taj mahal   i met a ginsoaked barroom queen in memphis      she tried to take me upstairs for a ride    she had to heave me right across her shoulder    cause i just cant   could i stay with you for a few days  you idiot  you told her  she told me  things have been crappy at home lately  i figured i wasnt spending enough time there  i figured  it turns out youre right  its always about sex  shes been having an affair   its the honkytonk women   want a beer   that gimme gimme gimme the honkytonk blues
