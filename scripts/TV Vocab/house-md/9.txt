                this is a really nice room  yeah it sounds thick too bad hes not coming  look i talked to him myself hell be here  right  youre the one who said the song could use a horn part so i got the best  john henry  you think im stupid  of course i do but thats not the point  hell be here okay  take a left up ahead  south street i cancelled this gig  you said you didnt want to do any sessions for a while  for a while  i called her i uncancelled it  but you up to it  lets find out  you lied to me john henrys never gonna show up  will you stop  its been like two hours  and we will keep waiting  i mean youve heard this guy play and you know what he does so can you just shut up tommy  oh my god  am i late  you need to hear it again  nope i get it lets try one  see what we get lets do it  john you okay you okay  i cant breathe i cant breathe    call an ambulance  now   original airdate on fox  february 1 2005  i want in  john henry giles you a fan of his music  hes a musician  that paralysis thing guy cant walk for two years and nobody knows why that seems mildly interesting  forget his paralysis  tell that to the rest of his bowling team  as far as this hospital is concerned this is a simple case of lowbar pneumonia  boring  but that not walking thing that could turn into something serious  marty hamilton is his primary physician out in california  hes dealing with the paralysis  know all about it  multiple treatments multiple surgeries  making real progress fixed everything but the legs  dr hamilton already called and asked for your team  and by team i dont mean you  like i always say theres no i in team  there is a me though if you jumble it up  foreman did his residency with hamilton  i know i did accidentally glance at his resume before i hired him  he wants someone he can trust  he must have spoken to foremans parole officer  someone who will stick to the pneumonia  john henrys on an experimental protocol for the paralysis  i respect that im not going to get in his way  its foremans case  its pneumonia he can handle it  guys already paralyzed how badly can he screw it up  so what are his stats  staying in the 90s on the nasal canula  coughing up much sputa  almost none he seems to be stabilized  dr house is there anything back from micro  not yet you gonna fire me  you can make up for it by washing my car  oh this is fun  lets keep him on the broadspectrum antibiotics  and since hes displaying septic physiology  draw blood for adrenal and thyroid function  how about the paralysis  were sticking to the pneumonia  well you certainly are boss  like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice  the paralysis has already been diagnosed by dr hamilton  its als  lou gehrigs disease its a lovely diagnosis  they make movies about it  no tests no treatment its a disease of exclusion  because hamilton has excluded everything else  i havent  what else could it be  guillainbarre which would be reversible  excellent  no the progression of the paralysis would be symmetric  this wasnt  transverse myelitis  hamilton tested for it negative  and he was negative for masses and avm and  antibodies could be attacking the nerve  multifocal motoneuropathy  uncommon but it fits its also treatable  did hamilton try putting the guy on ivig  no because the mri showed  well lets do an mri of our own  guys its my case  als fits it even predicts the pneumonia  the paralysis is progressive  its a death sentence  that doesnt make it wrong  so you think the breathing stuff is connected to my als  it makes sense  so its just gonna get worse huh  well dr hamilton  great guy really smart doctor but his treatment obviously isnt working  do you think im gonna die here or you think im gonna get to go back home first  an mri would give us a better idea  an mri come on for pneumonia  well dr house thinks we should test for  house yeah i heard about him obsessive sonofabitch   thats him  so who do you think is right hamilton or house  theyre both excellent physicians  come on  one of em says als the other one says not als  you gotta pick one son   everything points to als  then no mri  and i want one of them papers that say i i dont want nothin done if something go bad  a dnr  mr giles you dont want to rush things  its been two years i aint rushing  i wanna sign one  now while my arm still works  he signed a dnr  he rhymes with dinner  he signed a dnr  oh that makes more sense  you tell him it might not be als  no  well no wonder he signed who wouldnt  i started him on iv steroids and ancinthroid  great  if it was my case id be adding a little ivig to the mix  for his pneumonia  thats my story and im sticking to it  he doesnt want anything done no treatment  dnr means do not resuscitate not do not treat  you do nothing it doesnt matter which one of us is right  and hang on to that dnr  that signature could be worth a lot of money real soon  this is dr foreman whats mr giless status  okay increase the steroids to 100mg every 12 hours  and ah start him on ivig  yeah im sure one gram per kilo  my nature isnt what it used to be  the little man has lost some bounce in his step  he needs to crank it up have himself some fun this weekend  he wants the blue pills  youre talking about your penis in the third person  me and him two people  separate vacations  thatd be a drag for one of you  i dont think you need the pills  i think you have a conflict of medications  you need to up your insulin to chocolate chip ice cream levels  insulin  yeah you remember  thats the stuff you take for the diabetes that you forgot to tell the nurse about  your hands  no hair which means nerve damage  and your shoes look about two sizes too small which means youve lost sensation in your feet  and then theres your pants  my pants tell you i have diabetes  no they tell me youre an idiot  powdered sugar on the right pant leg  based on the two napkins in your right pocket  im willing to bet its not your first donut of the day  youre giving me the pills  sure why not  if youve got heart disease from ignoring the diabetes theyll kill you  otherwise you two have a fun weekend   breath sounds  junky  mucus plug  no its our mistake hes sludging from the ivig  blood cant get through to his lungs  start heparin 500ccs iv push  he wont last long enough for it to work weve got to intubate him stat  we cant  hes dnr  what  someone likes music  oh yeah  his stats are in the 70s how long has he been like this    well why arent you doing   the ivig put him into respiratory failure  you put him on the ivig  we did this  so undo it chase  its too late we killed him  nobody killed him hes not dead  chase intubate him  hes dnr  what are you doing  you cant do this  bag  you cant do this  bag  he had a bad reaction to some medicine we gave him  what did you just do  he saved his life  hes stable on the ventilator oxygenating well  the ivig made him worse  which means multifocal motoneuropathy was a bad diagnosis  okay whats really wrong with him  whats wrong with you  everyone knows whats wrong with me whats wrong with him is much more interesting  you tubed him and he didnt wanna be tubed  he has a legal paper saying just that  to intubate or not to intubate that is the big ethical question  actually i was hoping we could avoid it maybe just practice some medicine  theres no question  its the patients decision  if the patient is competent to make it if his thyroid numbers arent making him sad  oh my god you dont believe that  his thyroid levels were a little  its nothing do not defend him  why did he sign that dnr  i didnt talk him into  no he signed the dnr cause he didnt want a slow and painful death from als  what was happening to him had nothing to do with his als  right exactly its the ivig you screwed up  youre not gonna let him die because you screwed up  technically your case you screwed up  is that what this is about  looking bad in front of your old boss  you assaulted that man  fine ill never do it again  yes you will  all the more reason this debate is pointless  his lungs are worse any theories  oh im sure he just went to the little boys room  come on people  uh vasculitis  wouldnt likely hit both lungs  it could be wegeners granulomatosis  dr house  cuddy sent me a stripper again  ah love that woman so thoughtful  sorry  there are case reports of wegeners hitting both the legs and the spine  well its not great but its better than als  at least its treatable  its a restraining order  youre not to come within 50 feet of john henry giles  and theyve asked the da to file criminal charges for battery  cameron test the blood for canke sp  these are criminal charges  they arent going to let you take blood to make more tests  he has blood left in the lab just add on the canke  foremans still got you doing bronchioscopic suctioning for the pneumonia  every four hours  well while youre down in his lungs grab a biopsy  well need it to confirm wegeners  and move the patient to the second floor icu  why  its right about the clinic  im pretty sure its 50 feet in any direction  its nice having a court order saying you dont have to work clinic duty  dr cuddy  excuse me  you paged me  why the yelling  his bed is behind that wall  the plaintiffs  i cant you know come any closer  its right over the clinic very cute  can we get the lecture over with because ive got a  actually ive got nothing to do take your time  you need a lawyer  you dont have a problem with what i did  when i hired you i knew you were insane  i will continue to try and stop you from doing insane things but once theyre done  trying to convince an insane person not to do insane things is in itself insane  so when i hired you i also set aside 50000 a year for legal expenses  so far youve come in under budget  great  any chance you could help me run some tests  dr foreman called dr hamilton hes flying in from la  you can talk to him  dr hamilton is flying in as a friend of john henrys to pull the plug  yeah i need a lawyer  your honor on behalf of gregory house  we have convened an emergency session of this court to bring a motion requesting john henry giles remain on life support  mr house faces criminal charges for battery againstjohn henry giles  you beat up a guy in a wheelchair  dr house is alleged to have forced a tube down mr giles throat against his will  a medical tube saving his life  dr house please let your attorney speak for you  im sorry your honor i was way out of line  so uh your client forced the patient into this position  and now he wants a court order to force the patient to stay that way  without the tube theres a high likelihood that mr giles will die  well i assume the patient knows that he had a dnr  thats why your client is facing criminal charges right  exactly  and mr giles death will violate my clients sixth amendment right  his right to face his accuser  thats clever huh  your honor in commonwealth of pennsylvania v hozelton  the 3rd district ruled that a defendant may not use that status to rule against a felony charge  why are you doing this its not going to keep you out of jail  no  even if you win the restraining order and battery charge stay in place  what have you gained  time  to diagnose him you cant get near him  i dont want to get near him  you know how some doctors have the messiah complex they need to save the world  youve got the rubiks complex you need to solve the puzzle  are you done or do you have more references to 1980s fads  im trying to listen to this  that dnr may not be valid  the patient was suffering from depression brought on from a thyroid imbalance  the dnr order was witnessed by dr houses own staff a a dr foreman  my staff are idiots  im sure you know what its like your honor  sit down  the validity of the dnr is a question of fact  dr house should have the opportunity to make his argument at a full trial  and this poor guy has gotta stay on life support until we can schedule a trial  your honor  dr house i will hold you in contempt if you dont sit down  i have a medical issue  if it pertains to this case your attorney should  it doesnt  do you have any history of heart disease in your family  your honor  your fingers they show signs of clubbing which indicate a health problem  remember bart giamotti  same thing just dropped dead one day  please see your doctor  hes admitted this isnt relevant can we please get back to the motion  of course im sorry  your honor a persons right to control the treatment of their own body  is fundamental to understanding this case a long line of   congratulations impressive legal argument  i watched matlock last night  oh say no more i didnt notice any clubbing on the judges fingers  neither did i  so the family history thing  every family has some history of heart disease  and mental illness  biopsy only shows inflammation  start him on cytoxan  youre diagnosis wegeners based on a little inflammation  well unfortunately i think weve exhausted all the tests we can do in the capacity as the doctors he doesnt want doing tests on him  but you dont   well know im right if he starts walking  you cant do any more tests but you want me to treat him  the medicines in the pharmacy patients immobilized in the icu  sounds like a simple geography problem  are you asking us to jeopardize our medical licenses for this treatment  can i help you  uh im dr house im  gregg right  im marty hamilton john henrys doctor  we should talk  id appreciate any list of medications anything like that  ive started him on cytoxan  for wegeners right  look greggi checked you out you know  i know youre a good doctor  you have to appreciate that im a good doctor too  why  wegeners is one of the first things i looked for  the biopsy and the blood tests were negative just like yours  theres an error rate marty  and theres a time to let go  look im gonna take him off the ventilator and john henrys gonna die  hes accepted that  dr hamilton  hey how you doing  listen dr hamilton im sorry  i should have never put your patient on ivig  its not your fault eric  no its mine eric  thats not what i said  everyone asks about you back in la  hows the old place doing  oh this is wonderful  but before you guys break out the oil  i should point out you cant pull the plug i have a court order  you used to but  i have the right to face my accuser judge said so  not if no ones accusing you all the charges have been dropped  he doesnt have to die  its not wegeners  if its wegeners his lungs wont be able to handle it  as soon as they pull that plug hell die  thats why they call it pulling the plug  im gonna miss you  hes still breathing  his 02 stats are holding  hes holding his own  hes still breathing  its not wegeners  wrong again  hes stable but one of his arms is now paralyzed  the real question is why is he still alive  do you think hes just being stubborn  hes alive because you were wrong its not wegeners  yeah seem to be doing that a lot lately people keep living because of my mistakes  progression of the paralysis pretty much confirms hamilton was right  its als  assuming this is a progression of his paralysis  he cant move his arm  yes his arm is paralyzed yes his legs are paralyzed  why is everyone so gungho to connect those two conditions  you could think im wrong but thats no reason to stop thinking  how about this one hes not our patient  nope not good enough  he could have suffered a stroke when he was intubated  well blood clots are common in intubated patients  the inactivity causes  not interested in why  lets get an mrangiogram for an embolic stroke  he doesnt want you treating him  they dropped the court order  yeah and that girl dropped the charges against kobe  doesnt mean that he should call her and see if shes free to get a sundae  good point but i can go within 50 feet of him now  if you need anything page me any time  okay  get outta here  surethat makes sense you hate me for saving your life  in fairness to your side you were also dying because of me so  you know i didnt wanna be saved  thats whats interesting  your thyroid was low but not low enough to cause depression  so you came here to tell me that even if i cant walk i can still hear the birds sing  enjoy the rainbow and feeling the sun shine on my face  those things are fun  okay life sucks your life sucks more than most  its not as bad as some which is depressing all by itself  but do me a favor  just let me find out whats wrong with you  and if you still want to kill yourself ill give you a hand  that sound fair  yeah sure  ill stick around to indulge your obsession  its over i lost my air  the session the other night with those kids that was a test to see if i could still play  i cant  and thats all you are  a musician  i got one thing same as you  really  apparently you know me better than i know you  i know that limp i know the empty ring finger  and that obsessive nature of yours thats a big secret  you dont risk jail and your career just to save somebody who doesnt want to be saved unless you got something anything one thing  the reason normal people got wives and kids and hobbies whatever  thats because they dont got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true  i got music you got this  the thing you think about all the time the thing that keeps you south of normal  yeah makes us great makes us the best all we miss out on is everything else  no woman waiting at home after work with the drink and the kiss  that aint gonna happen for us  thats why god made microwaves  yeah but when its over its over  yeah  what are you doing  its not over for me  either youre gonna call the cops again or were doing this  if you wanna die you can do it just as easily inside an mri machine  so i go back to la im going the dana lectures again this year  wow thats quite an honor  its all political  to be honest youve earned it  i got honest on a couple studies i was doing  it all sells tickets  you remember last years lectures dont you  i remember the cigar bar afterwards  the only reason to attend the thing cigars and pool  you enjoy working with dr house  not the word id use  we work too hard not to enjoy ourselves right  hmm you seeing anybody  kinda sorta  serious  i dont know could be  you think she would enjoy la  hamilton offered me a job  you gonna take it  i havent decided  you already have the most prestigious fellowship  its a partnership  three times the money car allowance moving expense pension plan  the chance to work for a guy who gives a crap what other people think  so why didnt you just tell him yes  i made a commitment here  right  house would let you out of it in a heartbeat  or he wouldnt just to jerk me around  would you guys have taken the job  dont need the money  im not like you i dont hate house  you guys really dont have a problem with him with what he did  he knows we disagree with his choice  choice  chase its not apples and oranges its right and wrong  and he does it like he doesnt care  he assaults the guy and moves on to the next differential diagnosis like its nothing  what do you want from him  more handwringing more torment you want him to cry himself to sleep at night  yeah yeah i want some clue that he knows its a big deal  that it scares him that it matters  whoa whoa whoa whats that  it was a stroke  well done cameron  house called it the arm and legs are unrelated  you make enough calls one of them is bound to be right  yeah hes just a lucky lucky guy  listen listen i just think it wouldnt hurt him to learn a little humility  so whats the verdict  embolus the arm problems caused by a clot  theres a good chance we can still bust the clot with tpa  do it see what happens to his arm  we found a blood clot in your brain  wed like to start you on heparin its a blood thinner  what are the side effects  well your lungs are kind of chewed up from the pneumonia  good chance therell be an infusion  bleeding  into his lungs  its our best chance to give you back the use of your arm  i dont need my arm without my air  the damage would likely be minimal  no  its his call  or we could do an embolectomy  basically wed go in and pull the clot out  hes saying no to drugs and youre recommending brain surgery  bypasses risk to the lungs  itll either help your arm or  or itll kill me  from your point of view its a winwin  okay  well set up the procedure for today  were in your carotid artery  this is going to take us all the way up into your brain  you all right  yes  the sludge is blocking the blood flow to the part of the brain that controls your arm  all done  you still okay  i think so  i dont know i guess  its just with dr hamilton here i notice a difference in styles  his style involves humility  another difference in our styles i dont care much for apologies  you can go  i didnt know you were standing there when i said that okay  it was completely rude  do you mean genuine humility  you know with all the selfdoubt and the selfquestioning  or hamiltons polite patronizing aw shucks humility  youre both excellent doctors  thank you  and humility is an important quality especially if youre wrong a lot  youve been wrong every step of the way  of course when youre right selfdoubt doesnt help anybody does it  we gotta go  congratulations gregg  congratulations  why marty  john woke up he can use his arm  thank you  now look i know weve had our differences  but i think when a person does something well it ought to be recognized  the phone works  next time you want to make me feel all warm and fuzzy leave a message  dont get me wrong im overcome with joy  doc  yeah  what  you just touched my leg  what you gonna charge me with assault again  no i felt it  he now has feeling all the way up to calf  this is the way medicine evolved  patients sometimes get better  you have no idea why but unless you give a reason they wont pay you  anybody notice if theres a full moon  youre saying he just spontaneously got better  no im saying lets rule out the lunar god and go from there  something hes on is working  the enzyme replacement protocol is working reversing the als  the timing doesnt suspicious to you  heh heh do you think dr house will see it that way  figure its his medication doing the job  im sure he will  its one of ours  how do we figure out which drug is doing the trick  easy we stop all of them  one of those drugs is helping him  and the rest  steroids antibiotics antiinflammatories theyre toxic if we leave him on all of them  hell walk again  yeah to his own funeral  but if we stop everything hell get worse  true and then well add our medications back one at a time  if he gets better then well have our answer  and if he doesnt get better  then were in trouble  not as much as he is  i suppose that was your point  i assume you want me to convince hamilton to stop his treatments too  dont care  you know at least five of the medications are part of his protocol  if his stuff was helping the guy would be playing tennis six months ago  its our round of treatment thats helping  right so thats what youll stop  so your philosophy is  if they dont want treatment they get it shoved down their throat  but if it might cure their paralysis whoa better slow down  yeah  my old philosophy used to be live and let live  but im taking this needlepoint class and they gave us these really big pillows  whats your philosophy on employee relations  thats a very tiny pillow  great sounds like you know what youre doing  gregg can i have a word  can it wait for the commercial marty  say hi to my friend jimmy  pleasure  your diagnostic trial  seriously commercials in about five minutes  its a dangerous game  only if were watching in the bathtub  i need to know exactly what medications you were giving john henry  forget it  and if foreman tells you what john henry used to be on  youre gonna fire him  nope make him live out every day of his twoyear contract  foreman asked to leave  not yet  but how do you know i made him an  youre a polite twit but youre not an idiot  i need to know what medications youve taken him off of  wait a second youre not an idiot  you need to know what medications ive stopped because  hes getting worse  right now you still work for me come on  no feeling no wiggling  the bad news is john henrys back where he started  the good news is hamilton looks bad  yeah its not whether you win or lose its whether the other guy loses  what was the first thing we put him on  steroids for the pneumonia  well put him back on them give them 24 hours see what happens  his lungs arent great  it might cause another respiratory collapse  sure hope not  i didnt much like that lawyer and get an mri  he already got one and an mra  well obviously something is different now do it again  chase take care of the scan cameron put him on the steroids  we should probably talk huh  thin cuts  what levels  t9 through the quarterequinus same as the last time  you really think house would let foreman out of his contract  he has to  if he doesnt hes telling foreman he needs him  house cant handle that  oh my god  i checked him out  hes a great doctor  you think hes better than i am  this about your ego  answer the question  its not going to change my opinion of myself  might affect my opinion of you but that shouldnt affect your opinion of yourself  now im getting confused  if you think hes a better doctor than i am then you should take the job  otherwise you should get him to buy you two or three more nostalgic lunches and politely decline  its that simple  i should just ignore the mockery and abuse  oh how do i abuse you  how do you not if i make a mistake  i hold you accountable so what  dr hamilton forgives hes capable of moving on  that is not what he does  i screwed up his case he told me  he never said you were forgiven i was there he said it wasnt your fault  so  so it was  you took a chance you did something great  you were wrong but it was still great  you should feel great that it was great you should feel like crap that it was wrong  thats the difference between him and me  he thinks you do your job and what will be will be  i think that what i do and what you do matters  he sleeps better at night he shouldnt  arteriovenous malformation  intradural compressing his spine  causing his paralysis  how could hamilton have missed an avm  well we missed it too cause it wasnt there before  you saying it just grew overnight  no it was on the spine it wasnt on the mri  same anatomic location  its not there  well what is there  nothing  or something that looks like nothing  background noise static  scar tissue inflammation  if its inflammation the steroids would have shrunk it down  revealing the avm  which has always been there hiding behind its own swelling we remove that hell walk again  dr house  coras meeting me outside with a limo  im being discharged  fifty bucks says i can beat you to the curb  thanks for sticking with the case  i cant do anything else  youre much more easily amused when you can walk  how bizarre  im guessing you werent exactly mr sunshine even before your leg got messed up  i want you to have this  wow  you can sell it if you want to just promise me you wont play it  how many of those pills you taking  im in pain  yeah  arent we all  so where do you buy these things do they have cane stores  oh dont worry about it youll be jogging before you need a second one  see you tomorrow eric
