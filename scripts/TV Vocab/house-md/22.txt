scared before  right  you think being afraid of me is a symptom of a serious ailment  sudden mood swings infantile regression abdominal pain  hes passed out twice yeah i think it might be a medical problem   hes 20 minutes late im out of here  please  hell be here why  because he loves you and does everything hes told  because i didnt tell him youd be here   he likes to see  yes he does  stace   whats going on  hey  hi im greg house you must be matt   mark  mark warner dont get up  sorry parent conferences hi its okay   wow greg house  yeah wow  no i havent been avoiding you i just didnt want to waste your time  the other doctors checked me out they said it was just stress   college season kids parentstheyre all over me  makes sense to me   greg  what do you want me to do  you said youd check him out  he says hes healthy whats to check out  sorry for the mixup but im glad you two got a chance to catch up   looks like youre having fun  oh hes good  if you can fake sincerity you can fake pretty much anything   i cant tell you how much i like your fella  yeah me too  you know i thought youd be all sarcastic  bitter you know because stacy married me  we should do things together maybe throw a ball around or something guy stuff   we could go for a run together  ah its oscar wilde  wow this pissing contest is really turning me on  he needs to go to the hospital heres to women  cant live with em you cant kill em and tell the neighbors theyre stripping in atlantic city  damn straight   im definitely taller  i have more hair  and i think thatwhoa   mark     someone call 911 for a wagon to princeton plainsboro  garcon    what happened  its okay ladies and gentlemen nothing to worry about   unless you had the veal  you dosed him  i told you id check him out i was a little worried they were gonna get here before he passed out  would have been tougher to get him to drink  ill give you a ride we can talk   a tummy ache cranky no apparent source  any thoughts  foreman youre gonna contribute or are you too tired from stealing cars   im being house its funny  i know you made milk come out of my nose  morning you guys got the file whats wrong  previous tests revealed nothing that would cause abdominal pain or the mood swings  then were done what do you think ball game zoo   i dont care i just want to hang with you guys  what about drugs  his tox screen on admission showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate  yeah sorry that was me  i had to dope him up to get him in here  guy doesnt think hes sick who does  his wife the woman you used to live with  thats her indian name on her drivers license its stacy  i assume you have a point  you believe her over the patient himself thats why were taking this case  the truth i hear voices all the time telling me to do stuff   its crazy huh  what happened to everybody lies  i was lying  do the things the blah blah blah blah all that stuff the other docs did  if thats negative ultrasound his belly  if thats negative ct his abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast   did i miss anything  kitchen sink  well we could certainly give that oh you minx  what youre thinking is youre going to save him be a hero and win her back  its always impressive that level of twisted narcissism  shes married big clue i lost the game  you cant be within 50 feet of stacy warner  thought she wanted me to treat him  treat the husband stay away from the wife  but what if they get close to each other what do i do then  hey you have to treat this like a regular case  be yourself cold uncaring distant  please dont put me on a pedestal  we ctd your abdomen nothing that would explain the stomach pain    whats the next move  leaving  how many more tests do i need  how many more doctors need to clear me before we can get back to our life   just one  house  it must be awkward being treated by a man who used to be involved with your wife  its awkward being in a hospital when theres nothing wrong with me  mras were clean which means hes probably fine  he doesnt seem paranoid he shows no signs of  no it means we have no idea whats wrong with him  ben goldstein says his schedules locked he cant do it before tomorrow  no today call him tell him ill make it work   youre cutting him open  oh hold it theres no need for exploratory surgery  dr cameron has a diagnosis  no i just think its premature and maybe irresponsible  to do exploratory surgery before we know hes actually sick  no its premature to put him on a list for hospice care  and its maybe irresponsible to imply my actions are not rationally supported  all we have is his wife who says his stomach hurts  works for me the patient doesnt even think hes sick why would he consent to  his wifes a lawyer shes very convincing  call goldstein surgery is on    retract  insert  leslie versus leslie seems to be right on point  but im sure theyre going to try to distinguish it by  sorry theyll try to distinguish it relying on the minority opinion  double milk no sugar  i like sugar now  some people would be annoyed by that  you know why people sit in waiting rooms this is gonna be good  people think the closer theyre sitting to the operating room the more they care  thats why im here im not moving until everybody sees me  are you doing anybody besides mark  its a medical question because if i am his paranoia isnt paranoia  its a justified response and therefore not a legitimate symptom  knew youd understand  on the other hand if it was really just a medical question you would have sent one of your people  why just push my buttons when you can push theirs too  hey dr mandingo go ask the wife if shes been messin around  but youre asking because if i am unfaithful  i might sleep with you  the answers no i dont sleep around make sure you note that in his file  mrs warner  the surgery went well hes in recovery you can see him now  goldstein found nothing but a distended bladder  neurogenic bladder isnt causing the pain  it also doesnt cause personality changes  on the other hand it would completely account for camerons diagnosis  the patients completely healthy  get me the video of the surgery    dr mandingo youre needed at the plantation house  well dont everybody talk at once  theres nothing there  stop looking at the suspiciously empty bottle and look at the screen  heres why i get the big bucks  this is nothing  an enhanced version of nothing  this is the problem   unbelievable  tremors in the muscle fiber  thats not peristalsis   thats abdominal epilepsy  means theres some sort of neurological problem  a time bomb in his brain  i forget who said it was nothing  i saw a very small diffuse abnormality in the brain waves probably white matter  means his axonal nerves are dying  explains the neurogenic bladder enough nerves die he dies  global axonal nerve death  likely causes are encephalitis or alzheimers  early onset alzheimers the worst  he wont die right away hell just want to  ill check the blood for alzheimers protein markers  last i heard alzheimers had a genetic component did the patient have parents  parents died in a car crash no history of dementia  send csf for cbc and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis  and get tau proteins to check for alzheimers  and this still feels a little light  i took a complete medical history check out their house take sparky with you   they live in short hills two hours away  you can expense the tolls  youre not interested in a medical history  youre a peeping tom trying to spy on your ex  her secret diary thats the main thing  but as long as youre there take a peek in the medicine cabinet  check for toxins heavy metals anything that might explain this other than encephalitis or alzheimers  and get receipts for the tolls  making lunch i assume thats for mark  we know about his parents what about further back  grandparents uncles aunts how was their health greg hates fishing  hes got a theory  most likely candidate right now is alzheimers  no theres been no memory loss  i mean he forgets where he left his keys but who doesnt  any family history  of whackedoutness  his sister voted for nader twice thats about it  you were with house when it happened to his leg  oh  youre interested in him  we went on one date  it didnt go very well  our first date didnt either i was never gonna see him again a week later i moved in  five years what would you like to know  what was he like before his leg  pretty much the same    hes clear no alzheimers  yeah thats what i figured  serious mountain bike hasnt been used in a while though  he switched to yoga brandnew yoga mat and tape  mans getting older or it might indicate back pain  wife would have mentioned it yogas good for picking up the ladies too  not when you do it in your own home  change could be just a change not a symptom  chase  dear house boys a snack for your highly illegal search  hope you like oatmeal raisin love stacy  whoa in a desk drawer hidden in the back under some papers  secret stash  amphetamines regular use could lead to neurotoxicity  explains the axonal nerve damage and the personality issues  on the other hand prescribed to w brown  fake name fake prescription  could be but the prescribing doc his names real  this guys just had his license pulled for writing illegal prescriptions to high school kids  marks a high school guidance counselor  and mr browns birth date makes him 17 years old  do you think maybe these were confiscated by a high school guidance counselor  anything else um yeah he switched from mountain biking to yoga   could indicate  hes getting older   what did the csf say about encephalitis  said no champagne tap  no red cells no white cells serologys negative which means were back to alzheimers  i told her he didnt have it the marker tests were negative  well then you should have told her that he could still have it  pet scan will reveal any changing metabolic activity in the cerebral cortex  run him through and check his memory  were going to inject a chemical marker called fddnp   then im gonna ask you a series of questions  test my memory  yeah but first were gonna map out some specific brain functions  you know check out the engine before we take the car for a drive  checking up on me   i like all the pretty lights  yeah  okay  here we go  your full name mark warner   is your mother living  no  limbic systems intact  okay say you find a stamped envelope on the street what do you do   find a mailbox and mail it  geez what a guy  his frontal lobe is working way better than mine  do you remember when you got married  three years ago this july who is that  what could be a problem with his longterm memory   big church wedding  is that house  he remembers voices this serves no diagnostic purpose  i thought you skimped on the limbic system there  emotional reactions i just want to be thorough  did the atheistic bride wear a pretty white dress  was she thinking of you is that what you medically need to know  what jewelry did your bride wear  she never wears any jewelry except the cross her mother gave to her  no underwear either at least not that day  i remember cause she ripped her pretty white dress off in the car  that the sort of answer youre looking for doctor  i think i upset him you gotta stop this now  i remember the honeymoon was in paris i remember cause we didnt leave the room for two weeks   you want the details on that  a little defensive  its not paranoia if someones out to get you  here we go  hes sick paranoid and you keep hammering him about me  the questions were designed to define the operational parameters of his limbic system  elevate the words all you want you were just screwing with him low even by your standards  medical screwing its what i do  then you run away like a 12yearold go hide on the roof like you always do  i havent been up here in five years  i dont know whats wrong with him  its not alzheimers its not encephalitis  its not environmental its not immunological  every test is negative every time  hes perfectly healthy  but his brain is dying  it never occurred to me  that you couldnt figure out whats wrong  i havent given up  so what do we do  we wait  for what  something to change  its one of the great tragedies of life something always  something always changes    nurse  nurse  what happened whats wrong  my toesthey were numb tingling then nothing  no pain nothing  its okay theyre going to take care of you  im scared stacy hold my hand  what  whats happening  time marches on hes paralyzed  his symptoms mimic a peripheral nervous system under attack  but hes experiencing significant paresthesias and he cant move his hands or toes  its peripheral  guillainbarre syndrome attacks there not the brain  no no i already did an indirect coombs test  no agglutination no antibodies  initiative like that  start him on iv immuno  no antibodies means he doesnt have guillainbarre period  period more like dot dot dot  what ifhe has the virus but isnt producing those antibodies  come on the chances of that didnt ask about the vegas line i said what if  it would mean hes sick and his bodys not doing anything about it  so we either fight it for him or its fatal  fatal sounds very bad to me  well without the antibodies we cant even test for it dont know if were right  treatment isnt all that dangerous plasmapheresis and ivig  if it works were right if he dies it was something else  so the paralysis might not be permanent  thats our hope but the brains tricky you never know  what was that what   with the head the look  he just wants to talk to me   well if it was medical he should be talking to me  ill be just outside the door  leave go talk to him   youre going to leave me anyway  no thats not gonna happen  you left him and he had a limp if i cant walk or hold you  honey im not going anywhere im not going to talk to him   if i cant feed myself  mark what youre feeling its not real its the virus   mark what is it  mark  his throats closing up he cant breathe code blue hurry  hes having a reaction to the ivig i need epi stat     i cant get the scope in his throat  stop that   hes having an allergic reaction hes crashing  no hes not look at his vitals  o2 sats are within range  im betting the only abnormal sign is sweaty palms  push two milligrams ativan    no allergic reaction just a panic attack  something obviously freaked him out  can we talk now  you couldntjust come into the room  hes had five visitors drive down i didnt recognize any of them  six more have sent him flowers candy and a teddy bear  which im sure he finds very comforting  but i didnt recognize any of the names on the cards  shockingly mark has friends and i have some new ones  no its not shocking that you have new friends  but it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones   i havent  no i didnt think so  i just think you didnt tell any of them that you were down here  now why would that be  what are you up to its gonna take a little while  why would you not tell your oldest friends  that you were taking mark to princeton plainsboro teaching hospital to try to save his life  ive been busy i havent kept track of who knows what  see my old friends are telling me to be careful they seem to think  he and he sent me the bear  figures  he seems to think that im not over you  and that it might be dangerous for me to spend time with you  im thinking your friends might have similar concerns  and so you didnt tell them youd be here with me  whats your point that im still in love with you  i should abandon my dying husband and we should head for rio  no  greg i appreciate what youre doing for us but i think maybe wilsons right  maybe you should just stay away from me       whats up   love the bear its adorable  my wifes gonna kill me were having company she cooked  i got marks latest blood work  hes not responding to treatment  im sorry  i was happy  hes my patient  im sure hes a good guy hes probably a great guy  hes apparently a much better guy than i am  and some part of me wants him to die  im just not sure if its because i want to be with her  or its because i want her to suffer  hey is it okay if i talk to stacy for a minute  ill be just outside honey  you two are good together  you know nothing about mark  he took you to paris  thats good enough for me  we never went to paris  your honeymoon its been your dream city  you wanted to go since you were 16 he actually took you no i had to work  we spent the night in new york then we went back to short hills what is it  when did mark switch from mountain biking to yoga  about a month ago  the same time he started getting sick what does that mean  we have two more symptoms  the patient was asked a series of questions to determine the functionality of his brain   you grilled him about stacy  whatever  yeah the point is he told us everything we need to know to diagnose him  that is if we use your fancy pet scan as a lie detector  see its a very creative process lying  now telling the truth is a much simpler process see here  question nine this is where mark gives a long rambling answer about taking stacy to paris   what does the pet scan say  minimal involvement just the frontal and temporal lobes  he said he went to paris and the pet confirms it so what  they didnt go  they didnt go to paris and yet marks brain apparently thinks  that he really did spend 40 francs on a tour of the bastille  so we have an intermittent syndrome that presents with abdominal pain  polyneuropathy paranoia  and delusions  now heres the thing about acute intermittent porphyria  itll jump you in a dark alley beat the crap out of you leave you bleeding  but it wears gloves so no fingerprints  doesnt show up in blood tests urine tests nothing  unless you catch it redhanded in the middle of an attack  but there are other symptoms of aip   such as  light sensitivity  yeah one of the true tragedies of this condition  is it makes you want to stick your cool new mountain bike in the garage  and take up an indoor sport like say yoga  start the treatment hematin and glucose  if you give him hematin now and youre wrong he dies today  theres only one way to confirm aip  urine sample made during the attack  and theres no way to predict when hell have another attack  sure there is  acute intermittent porphyria has very specific triggers  barbiturates alcohol high levels of protein will set off an attack  which trigger do you think set off marks not the faintest idea  thats why im gonna give him the combo plate all of it  so ifhe has this and you trigger an attack the attack makes him worse right  yeah but then well know what it is and we can treat it  but if i dont have this thing and you give me that shot what happens  no idea if we dont know whats messing up your brain we dont know how youll react  okay l i need a minute with my husband    he doesnt want the trigger  he wants to wait see if we can come up with another explanation  if it is aip how much time does he have  no idea next attack could be fatal  could be six months from now could be five minutes from now  i want you to test him fine  ill send for an hmb synthase mutation  genetic test lab will get back to us in a month  give him the cocktail set off an attack  no why not  because he doesnt want me to  im not gonna sue you im not gonna report you  he might hes paralyzed  either you cure him or he wont be writing any letters  im not gonna do it why not  you keep asking me that question my answer doesnt change  i gave him the parameters its his call  you want him to die i diagnosed him i did my job  you want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment youre way better at that than i am  is that what this is payback for your leg how many times have we been over this i saved your life  yeah maybe youre gonna kill my husband to teach me a lesson  no hes gonna die cause hes too stubborn to make the right choice  now were in your territory  im respecting your husbands decision i dont see why youve got a problem with that  because its crap  because you browbeat patients intimidate them lie to them  if you think youre right you dont give a damn what they think  i did what you do all the time the only difference is i did it to you  hell never forgive you  yeah he will  still no change hes not getting worse   no no change at all  and thats consistent with aip right  until he has another attack his conditions stable yeah   mark youve got to  i dont want to take that test not until theyre sure   you dont know greg  not like you do  i only met him when he drugged me  boy are my ears burning   whats that  cocktail hour  just cause you cant hoist a few doesnt mean you should be left out   get away from me  mark if this is what he thinks is wrong with you  you trust his judgment more than mine his medical judgment  and youd bet my life on that i would  i dont  smart  its too bad youre paralyzed  bing paging dr foreman  leave the room its not your problem you need the consent from him  but doc he aint right in the head then you need a court order  okay then get one well wait here i wont do nothin  oh love the musketeer thing   i got goose bumps  give me the syringe  please if youre right this may be his only shot  so whats your plan you take the big dark one ive got the little girl  and the aussie will run like a scared wombat if things turn rough  i cant do it    you son of a bitch  see what i did there   when does it happen  if he had aip shouldve already happened   everyones different   this is not good  he could have an embolism tachycardia stroke  whats happening two milligrams of ativan   is that an attack     here  no youll pollute the sample   chase get urine from the catheter  its not an attack hes stroking     he needs ativan  this is not a stroke the deltawave burst is just a vasospasm   catheters out theres no way to collect the sample  heart rates in the 40s bradycardia   were losing him  hold him down  give him something  no painkillers you were wrong    straight from the bladder thats as fresh as it gets     would you give him the ativan already  he doesnt need to be awake for this  its still yellow  move   what  you think another lights gonna make the difference  organic chem more light more oxidation  does that ring any bells  start the patient on 150 milligrams glucose    hey hey  you wanna thumb wrestle  come on oh  hes still a maniac i know  dr house  hows he doing  never better  i thought  you were too screwed up to love anyone  i was wrong  you just couldnt love me  thats good  im happy for you        you fixed him  de nada  thank you  you were right  hes gonna be fine  no about me  im not over you  you wereyou were the one  you always will be  but i cant be with you  so im the guy  but you want the other guy  who by definition can never be the guy  whats so great about you is you always think youre right  and whats so frustrating about you is you are right so much of the time  you are brilliant  funny surprising sexy  but with you i was lonely and with mark theres room for me  okay  i want to run something by you  i will not have sex with you not again  it was miserable that first time  all that desperate administrative need  stacys husband is going to need close monitoring at the hospital  and since we can definitely use her back here  ive offered her a job general counsel  did she say yes  she said only if it was okay with you  yes or no  fine good  thats some bad hat harry
