leave a 2pound pile at the starting gate shaves valuable time of that final 8th  nice to have inside information  leads at the stretch by a length the burning bush and on the level is andy right up on the inside      is anybody here a doctor    you tryin to cop a feel  i took a cpr class at the y  that would be useful if she was having a heart atack instead of seizure  seizure hold her tongue down  if you wanna get a finger bitten off call an ambulance  methodistis 3 blocks down i could drive her  just make the call  man what the hell is that  how should i know  tell the paramedics to take her to princetonplainsborough  the doctors name is house  and its termigator winning by 2 lengths   original airdate fox 13dec2005  this is one does house hang out at otb  mans an addict  right addicted to pills not gambling  same thing  drug abuse drinking gambling  they all fire up the same pleasure centers in the brain  an addict is an addict is  gambling doesnt take away his pain  it does when i win  hot otb babe has grand mal and inexplicable bruising  what up with that  you were just standing there and she started to seize  spend as much time around the real people as i do someone gets sick  platelets are 89 shes anemic  and she has a blood alcohol level of 13  hot otb babe  obviously a working girl probably an std infection  no fever no infection  alcohol abuse explains it all  causes seizures and affects her bloods ability to clot which causes bruising  start her on heparin shell be fine by morning  except for the fact that the bruises are not petechial which means its not dic  so the bruises were caused by trauma  she probably got beat up by her boyfriend or her pimp  whats that called when you judge someone before ever meeting them  shes a regular at otb  somehow i dont see her holding down a 9to5 and going to pta meetings  i was there  i have a 9to3 job  it could be sle familial telangiectasis   or even cushings  good start with those   which one  cushings  explains the seizure and the bruising  not the anemia  so she doesnt eat a lot of meat  dic brought on by alcohol abuse is far more likely do a full workup  h and p and lab her up lp mri  whwhoa  did you just eversosubtly order me to get her medical history  cuddy put me in charge last week soyeah  it was a pretend in charge  formality to get past the suits in legal  right those licensing board folk love to play dressup and pretend  hey no worries ill let you keep your parking space  you can have it  youll also need my handicapped placard  bend over  well you make a pretty convincing argument  chase killed that woman now foremans in charge  yeah we have a pecking order here  if cameron kills somebody chase takes over theres a flow chart in the lobby  for the next three weeks you answer directly to dr foreman  and i expect you here for grand rounds at 900  by the way i like sugar in my coffee  if theres a screwup its your screwup  you wont have dr house to fall back on  do you wear a seat belt  is that really relevant to a seizure  skip it  how about um  were you vaccinated for polio  i think you gave me the form intended for fdr  you really like teeny tiny mo in the 5th  i went 4 for 6 yesterday  you want winners cure me first  are you generally satisfied with your life  it does not ask that  you know i was going to ask  what a respectable doctor was doing in an otb parlor  somehow that question doesnt seem relevant anymore   whats your excuse  turns me on  yeah what else turns you on  drugs  casual sex  rough sex  casual rough sex  im a doctor i need to know  no sex  just moved here  havent even found a job yet dont know anybody  came here without a job  that means you didnt move here  you moved away from somewhere else  whew   does that hurt  no  you on prescription meds hormones prednisone  i already answered that one i think it was question number 20something  yeah and i could reach down and get it  but that would kind of spoil the whole cool move  im not on any medications   you vegetarian  no why  because you might have something called cushings syndrome  which basically means  my pituitary is overproducing acth  which is causing my adrenal glands  to push too much cortisol into my bloodstream  by coincidence  im a doctor too  yeah i had it last year  they did brain surgery  removed an adenoma from my pituitary    huh  what did you just say  you were right house her pituitary tumor regrew  it is cushings uncanny how you do that  actually it was camerons idea  no cameron had three ideas  i chose one to encourage to nurture  yeah youre all about the nurturing  do you need a hug  i dont see any regrowth  you get a medical records fax over  work smart not hard thats my philosophy boss  ill take that as a no  foreman anica i need you to stay completely still  sorry  still dont see anything  okay so its a micro adenoma too small to see  its so small its not even there  right its just a coincidence that i predicted a rare condition that shehappened to have a year ago  results from her lp back yet  didnt do an lp i knew what she had  window closed   go do the lp  okay i need you to roll over on your side kiss your kneecaps  party time  i thought it only took one doctor to do this im observing  shes here to make sure i dont paralyze you  youve done this before right  successfully  hes kidding hes an excellent doctor  house im gonna numb the area with some lidocaine  and then were off to the races see what i did there  i used horse racing jargon to make the patient feel more comfortable  okay here we go   ow  felt like bone does that hurt  a little bit what are you doing oww  try running your back a bit more  perfect is the way you are     oops that was all me  ow  might wanna move down one vertebrae  this is actually much harder than i remember   ohh  my chest feels a little tight  try taking a deep breath  dr house maybe i should take it from here  eighth times the charm  aah  you trying to piss off foreman   let  cameron eps 240 over 140  turn that thing off will you  take the needle out   take the needle out  okay  its a hypertensive crisis start her on an iv lopressor drip  titrate to systolic less than 140 shell be fine  house cameron meet me in my office  house at the risk of sounding redundant  and rightagain  she has cushings  cushings  rightthe fact that you mangled her lp has nothing to do with it  actually it has everything to do with it  cushings plus stress equals hypertensive crisis  smart move sending the rookie  her initial symptoms could have been caused by alcoholinduced dic  she hada hypertensive crisis because its been at least six hours since she hadher last drink  shes detoxing  the exact same moment that im futilely trying to give her an lp  right an invisible tumor on her pituitary is much more likely  chase what if the tumor is somewhere else  there could be an acthsecreting tumor on her lung or pancreas  its awfully rare  not as rare as an invisible tumor  why didnt they put you in charge instead of foreman  oh yeah youre the guy that killed that woman  get a panman scan before she dies of cortisol od   please  fine do it  but when you dont find anything  put her on a librium taper for the withdrawal and get her a bed in a rehab clinic  chase lungs look clean  her lymph nodes not enlarged  cuddy tapped foreman to run the department   i didnt even get asked  neither did i   you were suspended  i was kidding  its the irony of women in charge they dont like other women in charge  hmph  what you think its something else  you sabotaged yourself  you went on a date with house you slept with me  putting you in charge of this department is like a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen  yeah theyre really worried that im gonna create a hostile work environment  maybe thats the problem  being in charge means having to say no to house  would you hire you for that   anderson coming out strong  what is he thinking he watched what tom meents just did  you ordered mris for the entire maternity ward  i was in a crazy mood  good thing i got a new boss to back me up  although i think one of those is actually necessary  better comb through before you cancel them all  what do you expect me to do house  quit cry  actually i expect you to act like what you are  my employee my subordinate  my bitch  yeah well since you asked nicely  god i cant believe i got more than a year behind  on my discharge summaries gotta get caught up  oh no wait  im not authorized to sign these anymore only you are  keep it coming im not gonna break  scan showed a mass on her pancreas  it looks malignant probably inoperable  id give her two months    on the bright side it still means i was right  wheres dr house  dr foremans overseeing your case  he thought itd be best if i spoke with you  we found a mass in your pancreas  it looks like cancer  so something in my pancreas caused me to have a seizure  probably but the bigger point is   a one year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is less than 20  so whats the treatment  we need to biopsy the mass to see what were dealing with and  then we can recommend options from there  sounds good  i need your consent to do the biopsy  thanks  wish me luck  good luck  cameron it was weird she barely reacted at all  ive had people hug me  and people take a swing at me  this was more like she didnt even hear me  magnify three times  house assisting that is funny  too bad foremans gonna die  good afternoon  im dr house  im going to be looking at your  perfect  excuse me  i need dr foreman in exam room one for a consult  so when did this start  a couple weeks ago  i didnt want to get pregnant  jakes not into rubbers so i got on the jelly  you think im allergic or something  you have an infection gonna need a sample  i brought the jar  no i meant a sample of your  okay we have a neurological problem here  theres something wrong with my brain  oh yeah  you can cover yourself up i got what i need  whats up  smell this   smells like vaginosis  but its not really my call  great ill be sure to put a gold star by your name on the board  anicas biopsy for pancreatic cancer  was negative  okay im gonna give you some antibiotics  and you probably shouldnt have sex for a while  how long  on an evolutionary basis id recommend forever  the mass in the pancreas is benign  its probably just scar tissue  good news shes not sick all other than being an alcoholic  the labs you sent yesterday put her acth at  shes got cushings something set it off  its gotta be in her brain  set her up for a venous sampling  there is another possibility  chase hold on  howd you get him trained so fast  electronic collar  got treats in your pocket  she didnt even read the consent form for the pancreatic biopsy  who reads those things  maybe she didnt read it because she knew that there was nothing wrong with her  there is another explanation for the cushings maybe she injected herself with the acth  her behavior suggests munchausens  shes had four hospitalizations in the last four months  well being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you  shes had zero symptoms since she got here  the scarring on her pancreas could be be caused from injecting herself with the benzene and setting offthe seizures  house shes had brain surgery  you can fake a stomach ache you cant fake a brain tumor  you can fake an invisible one  we should check her apartment look for medications syringes   venous samplings easier  and more dangerous  not if you get caught breaking in  so dont get caught house  why do you think cuddy picked foreman over me  if i done something wrong or if theres something i needed to improve on  would it make you shut up if i told you she wanted someone black  how would you describe my leadership skills  nonexistent otherwise excellent  theres more to being a leader than being a jerk  the world will never know    no no way   it just snowed  yesterday  the streets are clear  my car is right there  theres construction on elm bikell be faster    cameron theres even books in the bathroom  well either shes very smart or she has a severe fiber deficiency  tuesday 1 pm opthalmologist  dr peterson thursday 10 am gynecologist dr lachowicz  shes got an appointment with her ophthalmologist on tuesday  and an appointment with her gynecologist on thursday  multiple appointments with multiple doctors  symptom of munchausens  or just thinking outside the box here she has a vagina and trouble reading  theres three pairs of reading glasses each with different prescriptions  which would be explained by a tumor pressing on the optic nerve  because youre looking for her to have a tumor  and you are looking for  a person with munchausens syndrome  drinks battery acid they dont go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated  an ophthalmologist is a doctor attention is attention  how many hospitals have you contacted  has one doctor said shes crazy its not munchausens  its not your call  if you think shes got munchausens then obviously you got something to show the man  a syringe in her apartment a bottle of acth  munchausen patients are good at covering their tracks  oh right so the fact that we found nothing  proves theres something  look at the pathology reports from the surgery she had in chicago  they removed 30 of her pituitary  they found no tumor  its possible the surgeons just missed it  i mean that kind of surgery youre just cutting and hoping  of course were both right excellent solution everybodys happy  come on step up foreman  if you think im right order me to stick a needle in her brain  if you think camerons right send the patient home  either shell be fine or shell die  do the venous sampling get her consent  nice move boss way to cover your ass  i just agreed with you  not because you think im right  youre just taking the safe route  youre a wuss  dont worry your secrets safe with me  house hey wilson guess what foreman just did  hi  this is a consent form to stick a wire into your brain  its important for hospitals to get these signed for procedures that are completely unnecessary  then why are you doing it  because youre mentally ill  you injected yourself with acth to induce cushings to get attention doctors  and so far its worked  id like to see another doctor  im not giving you what you want  i dont want a bitch  just sign the forms okay and ill get out of here  hopefully for you what ever you injected yourself with wont wear off  before you get fun of a caring and concerned doctor cutting into your head  you chose me to make house miserable didnt you  apparently hes making you miserable  thats impressive  find someone else  no  for the first time in six years im getting copied on all experimental tests and procedures  clinic hours have been logged and completed  youve given me four months of houses dictations  so i can finally bill insurance companies  i only did that stuff to prove he couldnt make me miserable  well way to go  now everybodys getting what they need even house  he gets to play mad scientist and this department runs smoothly  so im stuck with this for the next three weeks  maybe longer  would you be interested if this wasnt just pretend  what did mommy say  i dont get any candy in my stocking  patient being prepped for the venous sampling  yeah  mentally ill patient is right on track for a pointless procedure  yeah we get your objection   foreman  are you sure  that doesnt make any sense check it again  haw we gotta delay the venous sampling  why her urine turning orange  how would you know that  because thats what rifampin does  shes not on antibiotics  but if a munchausens patient thinks shes about get busted  she sees pills labeled dangerous might cause seizures she might grab a couple  and if that label were accidentally on a bottle of antibiotics  and if that bottle were accidentally left in her room   you set her up  might have  its munchausens  all this she did to herself  i dont  what the hell youre talking about  i had a seizure im sick i need your help  not from this department  the halflife of rifampin is three hours after that youll get your psych referral  and your discharge papers  you know just because you stick your fingers down your throat  doesnt mean the rest of us are screwed up  i guess when cooperation fails you move onto hostility  i didnt do this to myself  chase  sign of a good liar   also the sign of a sociopath  what are you doing  correcting your last note  we cant discharge her shes sick  anybody ever tell you you write like a girl  what  you got some other explanation for orange urine   its munchausens  correct but not complete  you just dont wanna admit that she skunked you  at the end of the boy who cried wolf  the wolf really does come  and he eats the sheep and the boy and his parents   the wolf doesnt eat the parents  it does when i tell it  youre not telling the story now i am  look i checked her records  all her hospitalizations were for different things  brain tumor fainting spells skin rashes seizures  shes had every blood test known to man and the results were all over the map  theres only one constant low hct  the anemias real  theres a million things she could have taken to have done that  true could just be her mo  she selfinduces two illnesses one always changes one never does  or maybe she has munchausens and aplastic anemia  which would mean without the proper treatment shell continue to get sicker weaker  eventually shell start bleeding internally and die   shes not getting sicker  she will  if her bone marrow was dying the entire blood panel would be affected   her white counts normal  so far  we need to do a bone marrow biopsy   no no more tests  look  you kick her to the curb with a munchausens diagnosis  youre guaranteeing that no doctor will ever listen to her again  we do more tests well only be feeding her psychosis  the more attention we give her the more shell want  what if she doesnt know were testing her  house you were wrong live with it  theres probably some blood left over from previous tests  blood tests alone cant confirm aplastic anemia  yes i know thats why i wanna do a bone marrow biopsy  the blood tests could show a systemic disease or a virus or toxin that could be the cause  fine you wanna test the extra blood knock yourself out  but the patient is offlimits  and if the results are positive  i get my biopsy  its a safe way to go  i need all of these tests and a pcr done on this sample  youre gonna need more blood  patients empty  then i cant do it  you can try  you can try to look like salma hayek  its not gonna make it happen  you may not have salmas ass but she doesnt have your eyes  yeah right  how soon do you need it    dr wilson can i talk to you about something in confidence  of course   its about house  oh then no  fine  i wont say anything  do you think theres any way  house would take me seriously as his boss  uhwhere is this coming from  did cuddy say something  we talked she intimated  and you want my advice on how to usurp him  its very ancient rome hell need a toga of course a  sword  its not a coup  i just wanna figure out some way we can work together  i mean i keep the team running from an administrative point of view  house doesnt have to deal with the red tape   its a winwin  im sure hell see it that way  you have any advice on how to approach him   how to deal with the guy  no  but you wont tell him we talked  no  there is no way this is gonna happen    oh aint he sweet    see him walkin down that street    so i ask you very confidentially    aint he sweet   epsteinbarr titers are through the roof  most common viral cause of aplastic anemia  so what im saying is   just cast an eye in his direction    oh me oh my aint that perfection   fetal hemoglobins also elevated  yeah just a wee bit   could indicate  uh you see that in sickle cell  not all sickle cell patients are black  none of her other blood panels showed any sign of sickle cell  which means either somethings changed drastically since yesterday   or this isnt her blood  oh course it is  metaphorically  look i couldnt do the tests  i tried and there wasnt enough blood left over  you just let me do the biopsy  chase no way  i just got back from a suspension  and if it wasnt for me you would have been fired  why dont you just get the sample yourself  since when have you cared what your boss said  i dont care what anybody says i care what they do  and right now blackpoleon blackaparte has got the nurses on red alert  i cant get into the patients room  so come on ill draw the enemy fire  you outflank them get in there get the bone marrow sample  cant  who are you more afraid of  im not afraid of foreman i agree with him all the tests back him up  all the tests have not been done  you do realize that blackapartes reign is only temporary  i also realize that no matter what i do youre still gonna treat me like crap  crap is a relative term  i never even made it into the room  nurses called the attending as soon as a trocar was ordered  you used her real name  i just processed your patients discharge papers  shes on her way out right now  whoa whoa whoa  wait up  its all right shes gonna stay   wonderful  oh bite me  i dont need to hear the riot act again  how would you like another medical test   what  sit  why  so you dont crack your skull when you pass out  just do it   you know what colchicine is  no  well dont feel bad its for gout  its got nothing to do with anything youve ever pretended to have   im not pretending  shut up  colchicine decimates your white blood cells  and leaves almost no trace  its great for faking your way into hospitals   i didnt fake my way  shut up  youve beeing this for years  dont worry its probably not your fault  when you were a kid you had a close relative who had a chronic disease  probably your sister  you saw all the attention she got while you were left alone ignored  and it really seriously crewed you up   i do not have a relative  shut up  im trying to give you what you want  and save your life  you have aplastic anemia  what are you trying to scare me now  it means youre not just sick in the head  the problem is the rest of you appears well  so ive got to make you seem as sick as youre supposed to be  by injecting you with a drug  that simulates symptoms that you actually have  all you need to know is  youve hit the munchausens jackpot  im gonna give you a cocktail of insulin for a seizure  and colchicine to kill your white count  this will absolutely confirm my diagnosis of aplastic anemia  there is onesmall catch  if youve actually done something to yourself to cause the anemia  then im wrong  and if i do what i plan to do  then the treatment will kill you instead of saving you  so i need to know  have you been taking anything besides the insulin the acth  and the pills cameron left in your room  no  good  give me your arm  it was my mom  she had ms  she was in and out of hospitals all the time  people were always trying to do things for her  bring her food or brush her hair or  make her happy  people cared  she died when i was 16  then there was no one  boo hoo  where are you going  well i obviously cant be around when it happens  well what are you gonna do youre just gonna  relax you know the drill  people walk by here all the time youll be fine  so fairly off the door and she has another seizure  she mustve somehow grabbed insulin on her way out  once shes stable we need to get her out of here before she does more damage to herself  we cant  her white counts down  sorry i missed that  hearings been off since the ricky martin concert  some cholo kicked me in the head  white count hematocrit and platelets are all off  her bone marrows shutting down she actually has aplastic anemia  say what  cameron all her other labs show nothing that would  lab  a good diagnostician reads between the labs  you were right  hey hey hey were not here to play the blame game  these things happen  sometimes doctors send people out on the street to die  after other doctors warn them that theyre sending people out on the street to die  theres no way you could know  ill go give her the news  who are you  im dr foreman im in charge of your case  you have aplastic anemia  which means your bone marrow has shut down  and your body cant make new blood anymore  are you sure  i went back and checked your old records  it makes sense  the aplastic anemias apparently been developing for months  im sorry we shouldve caught it earlier  so  its not just the latest white count thats leading you to feel this  i know this is scary  but a bone marrow transplant could cure you  a marrow transplant could kill me  the other option is weekly blood transfusions  injections of gcsf   its a lifelong regimen  yeah i dont want that  are you sure  ii dont want to be ruel here but  you jumped through a lot of hoops to get this sort of attention  i just wanna be healthy  its not so much fun when youre actually sick  no  well um well check the registry  see if theres a donor match  thank you  we have to kill all the old bone marrow before we give you the new stuff  youll have no immune system  well keep you in a sterile room for two weeks to make sure everythings dead  then well give you the donor marrow  itll take another couple of weeks until it takes hold  you wont feel a thing  if you get uncomfortable for any reason i need to talk dont yell  walls are four inches thick lead  use the microphone  are you ready  okay    wheres dr house  turn it off   now what  how long has she been in there  three minutes whats going on  she doesnt have aplastic anemia  she has an infection  no her white count would be through the roof hers is one the floor   well the body does crazy things  the body does crazy things  well that explains everything  she had no fever  cause her selfinflicted cushings suppressed her immune system  stopped her from having a fever hid the infection  clostridium perfringens could cause the bruises schistocytes the anemia  explains everything except the white count  augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system why dont we try that  wwyoure taking the safe course  whats going on  theres lots of explanations for a low white count  name one that fits her case  colchicine  i figure that shed gotten her hands on it and uh just selfmedicated  thats brilliant of her  take the exact medication that would confirm your diagnosis  people do crazy things  you injected her against her will just so you could be right   she consented  shes mentally ill  but she smells oh so sweet  she wouldve gotten sicker when i said she was gonna get sicker  except cameron dosed her with antibiotics just hold this   is everything okay  pull my finger      grapey  you have a bacterium  its on all of us but  the bruises you gave yourself with the cushings made a lovely home  bacteria moved in  parked their cars on the lawn there goes the neighborhood  by neighborhood i mean your internal organs  so should we put her on the augmentin boss  or do you think she injected herself with grapes   i love the smell of pus in the morning  smells like  victory  if you were serious about the offer  im serious about accepting  id like to run the department  and you said it yourself things run smooth  except for the part where house went behind your back  and kod the patient with insulin and colchicine  there was no reason to suspect an infection  even house didnt think it was an infection  you wouldve done the same thing i did  and id be just as wrong  what house did was insane but he saved her life  he got lucky  he got her to admit shes got a problem  shes agreed to outpatient treatment  he gets lucky a lot  did you ever really intend to give me this job  or were you just trying to stop me from stepping down  youve got two more weeks in charge  hopefully the next case will go better  she shouldve died  house is not a hero  a person who has the guts to break a bad rule  theyre a hero  house doesnt break rules he ignores them  hes not rosa parks  hes an anarchist  all he stands for is the right  for everyone to grab whatever they want whenever they want  you tell doctors thats okay  your mortality rate is gonna go through the roof  kinda digging this whole foremanincharge thing  you know  it frees me up to watch my soaps  catch a movie in the afternoon  have lunch with you  yeah thats a big change for you  now cuddys up foremans ass not mine   carols everywhere  you couldnt live with foreman as your boss  why not  people can change you know   sleigh bells in the air    beauty everywhere    white count is way down  oh  were going to need to admit you just run a few more tests  whatever you think is best   christmas time is here   last race at the belmont put it all on the 5 to win   oh that we could always see   such spirit through the year
