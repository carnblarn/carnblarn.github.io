                whoo  all right hold on i got to turn up here  whoo hoohoohoohoo  how cool was that  that was way cool  oh  my turn  no sorry thats not allowed  i just signed 15 pages of forms saying you gotta ride on the back of that thing  i dont see any lawyers around  you know thats not the point  no you just wanna keep all the fun to yourself  come on dad  you go over 15 were pulling over all right i mean it   youre the best  all right get on there  put on your goggles  ready  got the clutch in all right thats my boy  whoo hoohoo  whoo  whoo  adam youre going too fast slow it down  i mean it youre going too fast slow down  adam  adam  let go of the throttle  adam adam adam   original airdate fox  14 february2006  what do you got   nasotracheal intubation start a bag of lactated ringers wide open  is he gonna be okay  well be with you when we can get him out  wait wait wait  ill start fluids  lets go get him moved up  deremaki  deremaki  been looking for you  been avoiding you  burn unit can handle it  if they could handle it they wouldnt be asking for you  is that a journal  a friend wrote an article  in hindi  they have a cutting edge neuroscience program in india  says so right on the cover  this kids heart rates messed  tachycardia can be explained by the burn  i assume the burn unit knew that  his potassiums low  which can also be explained by the burn  except im sure the burn units pumping him with fluids  which means his potassium should be going up not down  could be amphetamines  or bacteria lunching on his heart  or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing  he needs an ekg  eww  okay no skin no ekg  is he even going to survive the burn  you got a date or something   if the burns unit can prevent an infection  his body will regenerate maybe 10 surgeons will do 20 or so grafts  six months in this room hell end up with a series of nasty scars  maybe some pain  but hell live  unless his heart shuts down because we cant figure out whats causing the low potassium and tachycardia  we need help from a belgian doc named einthoven  hes dead  while he was alive he invented a little ditty called the galvanometer  where do we get one  go to any electronics store thats been open since before 1905  theres a good chance they got one in the corner in the basement  we need an audiovisual  setup for the lecture hall   what for  for the lecture   what lecture  dr webers lecture   whos dr weber  uh neurologist i think  the memo was from you   wheres my assistant  she left   when  wednesday   seriously  the temp agency sent someone but she got lost  well when she gets here fire her  oh yeah  did you issue this memo  look at that  congratulations  the patient that has been in a coma for two years and counting is still in a coma  this is not my signature  i dont know anything about this guy im supposed to introduce him  have lunch    the  coma patient has a migraine  oh no no no  no i gave him medication to prevent a migraine  thats a migraine increased flow velocity in his cerebral arteries  i did subsequently give him nitroglycerin which could possibly  you induced a migraine headache in a coma patient  i gave him a little headache  similar to the one youre giving me now  have you even read an ethical guideline  well  itd be wrong to try out a new migraine prevention medication on someone who can actually feel pain  did you sign this  uhyeah  we can talk later about the appropriate discipline  because of the burn we cant perform any of our normal tests to see whats wrong  so were going to try a galvanometer  it picks up a pulse in the wrists and the ankles  hopefully it will tell us why his heart rhythm is abnormal  what have i done to him i  it was an accident  all right so  hes got all these burns and now theres something wrong with his heart  were trying to figure out if the two are somehow connected  had  he been sick lately  no nothing  anything unusual with his behavior had he been tired a lot   nothing  he was great he was happy  he was just having a great time and then  if he was experimenting with amphetamines or cocaine  no  we gave him some pot about a year ago to try  it was just once  we thought if we took the mystery out of drugs and alcohol the less hed experiment  well know more after the tests  it looks like theyre gonna electrocute him  plug it in  you plug it in  fine gimme the cord  works  prominent uwaves  no inverted twave  no ischemia  qwave normal  thats not good  chase turn it off  turn it off   whats happening  what is that  hes seizing get in here  who electrocuted my patient   he had a seizure  he wasnt electrocuted  what does the seizure tell us  move  what are you looking for  same as you love acceptance solid return on investments  differential diagnosis go  could be epilepsy or seizure disorder  not with the tachycardia  it could be a virus in his brain  specificitys impressive  adrenoleukodystrophy  could be ms seizures could be caused by plaques and lesions on the brain  well lets find out which get him an mri  no nuclear imaging  he wouldnt survive the move to radiology  mri and ct scan are both out  okay lumbar puncturell tell us if his proteins are elevated at least we can exclude ms  cant do a lumbar puncture either  youre cramping my exits  dont tell me no skin on his spine  wed be inserting a needle into an area thats teeming with bacteria  if he doesnt have a brain infection already wed give him one for sure  theres no other way to look at a brain  transcranial doppler sonography  she said brain not pregnant womans uterus they do sound alike  i used one to look at a brain this morning  why didnt you take the patient to radiology get an mra  obviously i was doing something illegal  and using nuclear imaging wouldve raised questions  youre not gonna get a diagnosis of ms from a sonogram  not definitively but patients with ms have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex  okay then  thank you for all coming to todays lecture by dr phillip weber  who is our guest today at our hospital to talk about headaches  dr weber is at the weber center for pain that makes sense  weberweber um so please welcome dr weber  thank you doctorcuddy  i suppose i should tell you a little bit more about myself  i went to school in virginia  youve never to one of these things in your life who is this guy  no idea  whats with the outfit  sudden chills and light sensitivity  inexplicable  i received my medical degree at johns hopkins university  where i studied under brightman and gilmar  hmmhe must be good you went to hopkins  and studied under brightman and gilmar  shh  helped me win the doyle internship at the mayo clinic  you were supposed to get the doyle internship  this guys von lieberman  the guy got you thrown out for cheating  the dean threw me out  von lieberman just ratted on me  this guys name is weber not von lieberman  i call weber von lieberman  way eviler shh  and five ht sub 1d receptors have improved the acute treatment of migraines  to this point  so whats the plan  you wanna wait til he bends over and make a fart sound  im not here about the past  hes a bad scientist  well you cheated off him how bad can he be  he got the answer wrong  doug are they trying to wake him up  they cant do that right hell be in too much pain  dont worry hes still under  but the brain never completely sleeps its always working  controlling your heart rate breathing temperature  cameron the eyes respond to visual stimuli  blood flow increases in certain areas of the brain and we can track that with a sonogram  with ms blood vessels are more reactive so flow is faster  if adam has an infection  thered be swelling which would constrict the arteries  and the flow would be slower  chase near the subarachnoid space    data from control subjects were analyzed with a twoway anova with status and side as withinsubject factors  you stalked this guy for 20 years just for the shot to humiliate him  shh im trying to learn  vessels without significant rebound  he doesnt even know what that means  youre going to interrupt him arent you  if i have a question  and whats that going to accomplish  why cant you just enjoy this  why cant you just be happy for me  you have got to find less debilitating outlets than humiliating people  i hear bowling is more fun than stalking  but im better at this  if p is less than point zero  blow a ton of money on a plasma tv  we found a subarachnoid bleed  bleed in the head isnt causing seizures  it could be 10 with damage to the cerebral cortex have seizures  or bacterial meningitis  viral encephalitis  theres no way to tell without  shut up  excuse me  not you  if my lecture is interrupting your meeting i can wait    as your people say in india appreciate it  well figure out why later um fix the bleed or he dies  talk to you in a couple of hours  deremaki  im in the subarachnoid space  can you get it  i think so  put the probe back where it was so i can see the wire   were looking for the bleed  look when i get there  im flying blind without a contrast ct here  and with a p value of less than 001  we have strong statistical evidence that this drug prevents migraine headaches without daily administration  uh excuse me doctor  he knows this field better than you do  its always been my understanding that uh  unless you follow a daily regimen no drug can prevent a migraine  thats why they call it a breakthrough  thats why you call it a breakthrough  no the uh pharmaceutical company sponsoring my clinical trials also hails it as a breakthrough  im sure your wife and lawyer do too  is there anybody who doesnt stand to make a fortune from it calling it a breakthrough  who are you  just a lunatic who desperately needs a hobby  how exactly do these studies work  do you give this drug to a bunch of people and  they dont get a migraine you go voila my drug works  uh excuse me miss  uh  do you have cancer  wow mango juice prevents cancer  perhaps i shouldve taken my medication before this lecture    dr weber we had a very specific control group  chronic migraine sufferers  i dont have time to go through all the math right now   but the incidence was dramatically  sure in india  two plus two equals five there right  do i know you  i know your math skills  they blow  touch  you sound very familiar  why did you publish it in an obscure journal in india  why not publish in really really cool head cases of south philly  neuroscience new delhi is a respected journal  yeah the guy running slurp n gulp tells me its one of the best  get a hooker anything  see im thinking that  publishing studies is probably the easiest way to get a pharmaceutical company to give you a reacharound  and choosing a journal that no one can actually read well thats thats shrewd  i know i know you  sure  you do  dick  the names philip  oh my bad  something to do with your face  i always think your name is dick  house  here  medical school was 20 years ago  give it a rest grow up  yeah you were always the grownup do the responsible thing  tattletale   you cheated  i cheated then youre cheating now  your drug doesnt work  oh yes you would like to believe that because it plays right into your fantasy   i tested it  oh really  what are your parameters wheres your study  room 2134  one patient  the coma patient  you havent changed a bit  you took short cuts in med school youre taking short cuts now  you cannot test this on an abnormal brain  thats so closedminded hes not abnormal hes special  cerebral cortex atrophies in coma patients  you need live conscious people  you dont know everything house  its something that disrupts brain function  plaques are perfect interrupt neuronal communication    ms  no  ms is complicated i think this is more basic its just tachycardia and seizures  how much longer the burn unit guys gonna keep him in that thing  lectures over lets go house wants to  adams waking up  get the anesthesiologist in here now  cameron hes in pain  thats not pain  need some help in here    adam had an orgasm  what  you mean while he was  oh  god  whats wrong  im having a migraine  are you okay  uh yes  i was right  oh  well knock you out for a couple of hours  no i got work to do  just gimme sumatriptan for the pain and verapamil so it doesnt recur  i heard the patient had fun in the hyperbaric chamber  yeah  gotta schedule me some time in there  webers meds arent even legal in the us  its legal in india  i was disoriented  um moving around is a bad idea  hey if you feel chest pain you need to let me know  verapamil can cause congestive heart failure  nothing can hurt my heart  foreman hey youre gonna feel some dizziness  definitely gonna be constipated  differential diagnosis for getting off  is he gonna be okay  no somethings seriously wrong with him  differential diagnosis for ejaculation  dont make me say it again  were not stalling we just dont know  then guess  could pain medication cause an orgasm  i wish  maybe pain caused the orgasm  you get a tattoo the brain releases endorphins which create pleasure  most people dont orgasm from a needle prick  well chase has a point  the brain is like a huge train station if the switches  ow  youre the neurologist talk for me  if sensory information got misinterpreted by the medial forebrain bundle  its possible for bad to feel good and good to feel bad  hes a lucky kid lets not fix him until the burns heal  so what attacks the medial forebrain bundle  infective neuropathies vasculitic neuropathies  krabbes disease metachromatic leukodystrophy  house all very bad things  no way to look for any of them in his condition  could be an infection  i said infection about eight seconds ago  you listed some brain infections  but what if its just a regular old infection festering in the burned skin  pus on his arm isnt causing problems in the forebrain  hes on 20 different medications to manage his pain his heart how often he urinates  his brain is like a waiter thats got too many  hey hey  i do the metaphors  the brain is stressed  an infection elsewhere could put it over the edge  so we just wait for his burns to heal to see if youre right  if youre wrong he doesnt have that kind of time  dominic larrey  he another dead doctor  he was napoleons surgeon in chief  cleaned a lot of battle wounds  by amputating legs  and with bugs  cameron maggots are implanted directly into adams burns  maggotseat dead people i  maggots eat dead flesh only dead flesh  so theyre perfectly suited to clean wounds  they also kill the bacteria that thrive in injured tissues  ho  dr jekyll i presume they found a halfeaten sheep in the zoo  the police want to ask you a few questions  i need something to wash it down  coffee bad idea youre better off with water  coffees closer  foolproof plan by the way  either his meds would work  and youd be in psychic pain because von evil is gonna be rich  or they wouldnt and you get to be in agony all day  perfect loselose situation very you  i had to prove  you proved nothing  right  this isnt a migraine  yeah dear new england journal of medicine i took this guys drug and still got a headache  thus scientifically proving that my arch enemy is an idiot  you just wanted the pain  the meds are supposed to prevent migraine  you get distracted by pain leaves less room for the things you dont wanna think about  like the flyers sucking or the price of gas or  oh the fact that you pushed the love of your life out of your life  god i wish the pain would go away  next time you need to get your mind off her stick a needle in your eye  its less annoying to the rest of us when you can still walk  did you sleep here  lower  do you want a pillow  not softer lower  the frequency of your voice is grating  you shouldve been better by now  im super  the patient  the maggots did great for the burn  but the brainwaves are still all over the map  which means your regular old infection isnt causing his brain dysfunction  which means theres an underlying condition which means we gotta get inside his head  do a lumbar puncture  weve already established that we cant get a lumbar  c2 c3  no no no way  i only saw a cervical tap once and that guy got paralyzed  ask the parents if they prefer to have their son in a wheelchair or dead  somethings causing his brain to lose control  eventually it will shut off  we need to do a lumbar puncture to get some of the fluid in his spine so we can test it  you need us to sign a consent  i have to warn you  theres a serious risk of paralysis or death  are you saying we shouldnt do this  you have to do this  then why are you telling us what can go wrong  i just think you should know  either youre cruel or this clipboard is a way for you to cover your ass in case you cripple our son   this isnt his fault  no its not its yours  thats what you keep telling me  my son is lying in there half dead i am just trying to find a way to get through this   im sorry  yeah i know  needle   its not going in  dont force it  im going one space higher  its too close to his brain stem itll herniate   youre gonna paralyze him  not helping    his blood pressures spiking stop  i can get it  hes 180 over 120 hes gonna stroke  im in the space gimme the vial    he doesnt have ms or an infection  his proteins arent elevated  wrong protein igm not igg  elevation was probably caused by the bleeding  what if there was tingling in his extremities prior to the crash  how can you still be on ms  you gotta be on something  somethings interrupting his neurons chitchat like lesions  we cant scan for them  only test we can do we just did and it was negative  he has no tingling no numbness  you read his history parents didnt say anything about  what about adam  we cant look into his brain but you want us to read his mind  good point  yeah you can finish the sponge bath in a minute  theyre just redoing his dressings  hes out hes fine  i didnt page you to put him out i paged you to wake him up  why are these lights so damn bright  thank you  come on i need to talk to him  house you cant wake up a burn victim to play 20 questions   its torture  he wont remember  hes gonna be in extraordinary pain  god youre good youre putting me to sleep  i know hes gonna be in pain i know you disapprove im his attending wake him up  mmmoh my god  im dr house  it hurts  its gonna get a lot worse so answer fast  before the accident did you experience any numbness or any tingling in your fingers  you got burnt its healing i need an answer  ow it really hurts  any tingling in your arms or legs  do something i cant  adam you gotta listen to me did you feel anything  i pissed my pants and then i dontremember  ahh ahhhh  is he okay  get everyone in my office  where are you going  kids screaming gave me a headache  i gotta take an aspirin  house  you okay weve been waiting for you  im hallucinating  hallucinations with migraines are pretty uncommon  whatd you see  i saw music  sensory deception makes no sense  shh  you took something   the kids fighting for his life   get miles away    get miles away    get miles away    get miles away    get miles away    get miles away    get miles   hey you find him  he was hallucinating in the locker room  he okay  hes feeling no pain hes high  vicodin high  past that hes seeing sounds  took something  why is it so dark in here beautiful day outside  open the shades let the sunshine in  its nighttime  its still tuesday right  you look better  i took something  mind if i ask what  uh little of this little of that  i know whats wrong with our patient  hes depressed   he told you that when you woke him up  no  he told me he pissed his pants and blacked out  thats not a diagnostic of depression  lack of appetite isolating yourself  uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what  seizure  which means the seizure he had when you tested his heart was at least his second seizure  so what depression and seizures arent correlated  no but you know what is  depression and antidepression medicine  tox screen was clean  yeah but you know how much crap hes got in his system for dealing with those burns  the guy could have the spanish armada floating through his bloodstream we wouldnt know about it  til they started firing cannons  antidepressants have been known to cause seizures in kids but not orgasms  this is a brain in trouble  this is a brain with too much serotonin  serotonin affects mood appetite it doesnt cause a brain to shut down  antidepressants fake brains into thinking they have more serotonin than they actually do  every 10 million or so cases it sets off a chain reaction  it produces too much enough to fry itself  if adam has serotonin storm its deadly  but treatable cyproheptadine  unless he doesnt have serotonin storm  he could just as easily have too much dopamine as serotonin  but if its dopamine the cyproheptadine will kill him  where are you going  im gonna talk to the kid again seems nice  you cant  why did he say he doesnt like me  the anesthesiologist told the parents what you did  everyones a tattletale  is your son depressed  no who are you  im dr house  oh youre the idiot who  i heard him screaming all the way down the hallway  if i didnt wake him up i wouldnt have learned what caused the crash  i think he had a seizure  ththis wasnt my fault  well if he hadnt had the brain problem he wouldnt have the burns  on the other hand if you hadnt put him on the atv he also wouldnt have the burns  you can debate your personal responsibility after i leave  i need to wake him up again  i need to know if hes taking antidepressants  hes not  hes the happiest kid i know  but you dont know do you  hes my son  mmm thats sort of my point  at 16 theyll tell anyone anything  except their parents  adam talks to us about everything  yeah i know about the pot and the cocaine   there was never cocaine  you sure  you having him followed  he told us when he got drunk at a party  he told us when he started having sex   he told us when he cheated on a math test  he told us when his girlfriend cheated on him  he doesnt hide anything from us   but if he was depressed  hed tell us  we dont judge hes not depressed were sure  bet his life on it sure  just hypothetically  yeah  okay  kids happy  happy happy happy  then were back to where we started seizure disorders  seizure disorders arent causing orgasms  vascular malformations  wouldve seen it on the sonogram  hepatic encephalopathy  liver enzyme tests were normal  where are you going  take a leak  what are you doing  cant come in here  youre not sterile  dont touch our son we told you  seriously millions of bacteria microbes on you  hell die of sepsis  if you go in there  i think hes gonna wake him up again  i know he is  house you cant do this  oh if i had a nickel for every time ive heard that  relax they gonna sue us  if im right i save his life  if im wrong hes dead no matter what i do  either way how much have i really hurt them  leave him alone  youre not sterile you wanna kill the kid  give me the syringe   no pain no gain  hey you gotta stop this  youre right   hes not depressed  yeah sure  im not letting you go until you give me that syringe  whats that on his wrist  a burn   why on his wrist  why not on his wrist  his back his torso everythings a mess his forearms are clean  except right there  so what  its a perfect circle  so a drop of burning gasoline fell on his wrist a screw from the atv  maybe  why are you torturing him  does your son smoke  id kill him  so he talked to you about sex crack  anything except cigarettes  he has a cigarette burn on his wrist  also a fading nicotine stain between two fingers  bad news you son has a filthy unhealthy habit  good news hes trying to quit  bad news the quittings killing him  good news i can cure him  bad news  nope thats the end of it  quitting smoking can kill  nosmoke meds are antidepressants  the crappy ones you get over the internet  theyre loaded with whatever antidepressants they can get cheap  since mommy and daddy obviously didnt take him to a pediatrician  sorry i was wrong about him being depressed  treat him  cuddy hey  did you drop acid  why would i do that  to annoy me  or maybe because youre miserable  or because you wanna selfdestruct  pick one  how bout because lsd acts on serotonin receptors in the brain which can stop a migraine in its tracks  im just saying its also a possibility   how did you know  cameron is worried about you  i told her that lsd lasts up to 12 hours if you were functional she must be wrong  either that or i also took a whole bunch of antidepressants which shortcircuited the lsd  im just saying that would also explain it  thank you for ruining my clinical trials  pharmaceutical companys shutting me down  youre kidding really  how could that surprise you  you sent them an email complaining about my math  telling them about your stunt  i didnt know people actually read emails  delete button is so conveniently located  so whats next  you gonna follow me my whole life torture me  why would i do that  you waited 20 years to do this  whats next break up my marriage  no were even  right  oh thanks for setting me up  eye for an eye lsd and antidepressants  everything in balance  buddhists call it karma christians call it the golden rule jews call it  i dont know  rabbi hillel said something poignant  universe always settles the score  does it  no  but it should  do you think youll ever be able to look at him and not blame me  yeah will you    im paula  hey paula  how you doing  you work over at the college or are you full time over at  im looking for a distraction  you dont need to talk to do that do you
