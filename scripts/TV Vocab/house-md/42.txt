                          hey guys guess he got away    can baby shoes come out to play    come on  hands on your head climb out  i cant climb out if my hands are on my head   just keep em where i can see em man  all right go head come on     you high popo  yeah man catchin morons makes me high  take your shirt off by your collar and turn around  whoo would you look at that  dudes got a weapon    all right you have the right to remain stupid  watch the gun  anything you say will be completely incomprehensible   seriously man careful  seriously man  seriously  your mama know what you do  bang     original airdate fox 2 may2006  aww thats sweet  your dads proud you made the local paper  from my article  give it a rest  you read what he wrote in the margin  our friend lazarus sleeps but i go that i may wake him up  yeah hes not proud of me hes proud of jesus  everything i do right is gods work everything i do wrong is my own damn fault  cop with a sense of humor  differential diagnosis  guys in the er bleeding on everybody   drugs  hes a cop  good point how about drugs  tox screen was clean he did however get hit by a bullet   just mentioning it  he was shot  no somebody threw it at him  im thinking trauma hes got bullet fragments lodged in his brain  according to baby shoes the cop was laughing before he got shot   baby shoes  guy who shot him  reliable witness  his name is baby shoes  how bad can he be  fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria  so lets expand the search factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs  why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate  cause hes in shock  what if the heart was already fast before he got shot  you mean after the foot race  hes giddy indicates a blockage of oxygen  carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate and cause coughing and impair neurological functions  he got co poisoning outdoors  yeah all cause those bastards didnt ratify kyoto kyoto protocol on global warming  or he got co poisoning indoors and moved outdoors before hed inhaled enough to make him drop dead  test his arterial blood gas  if his carboxy hemoglobin levels are higher than 15 stick him in a hyperbaric chamber  you go check the cop car for gas leaks or  if it was the cop car his partner would be sick  well maybe she is she just doesnt have as good a sense of humor  also check his personal cars work home  ill check the precinct    blood tests confirm you have lowlevel carbon monoxide poisoning  were putting you inside a highpressure chamber to  you dont really care do you  do you live near a gas supply  uh yeah me  after like a huge enchilada     anything toxic you have at your home  any paint solvents anything unhygienic  uh no  no i keep a pretty clean home        if you start having trouble breathing you can press this button and the chamberwill decompress  like this  dont now if you have trouble  ah its broken   all right well if you have problems well push it for you  ow ow  muscle contracture   how bad does it hurt  notnot at all  looks wild though huh  your brains not getting enough oxygen youre losing motor function  we  should start this right away   should i be scared  no you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place we have a guy there checking things out      sounds okay  how about the gas intake valve  looks great  its down in the furnace room  your systems fine  if you had a carbon monoxide leak half the force would be sick  then why are you here  i was wondering if you could do me a favor  yeah  ive uh  ive got a ive got a disability  these are speeding tickets  a lot of emergencies  hes  feeling better now but you never know  ill see what we can do    wheres your partner sit  place is a cesspool but i dont think i need to test for anything  nope waste of time  you know about the marijuana  ive heard rumors since junior high  the cops acting high because he is high   hes got  legionnaires disease  its a good thing joe got shot  the whole precinct would have got wiped out   anarchy on the streets  takes 48 hours to test for legionnaires  and only two seconds to recognize if the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid unchanged water of an ac unit  marijuana explains the high carboxy the cloudy lungs and the happiness  pot doesnt explain the fact that hes gotten worse since he was admitted  why dont we agree to disagree  actually why dont we agree that youll disagree with me while treating him for legionnaires  its not as pithy but  i feel a lot better  the meds are working  heart rates normal cohp levels are down no fever  take some deep breaths  you seem disappointed  im glad youre feeling better   you got a problemwith cops  please dont talk  in my experience people who just dont like cops have a reason  i need you not to talk  no rales  chase these clouded areas of the upper lobes theyre the infiltrates we found yesterday   not there anymore  theyre clearing up  you had legionnaires now you dont  so you didnt um you didnt find anything at my place  nothing medically relevant  so theres uh theres nothing i need to worry about then  not this time  whatcha doing  i want to make sure he sees whats involved  what we found was fairly advanced these cloudy areas here and here  these parts of your lungs simply werent functioning  theyre okay now right  everythings okay now  im fine  youre blind  i bumped into something that doesnt mean i cant see   im sure its frightening but you only think  whats dr cameron wearing  dark blue pants white shirt   black shoes  ooh almost  except for the pants shirt and shoes  youre blind  chase he really thinks he can see  he can physically see his brain just cant process it  no chance this is a practical joke  no way antons blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes  must be from the trauma  bullet fragments just happen to hit the same spot in both lobes  stroke could cause antons blindness and euphoria  office krupke is clotting in his brain  start heparin to thin the blood find the clot and yank it out  clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertebral arteries  great chase stick your fingers in there grope around till you find it  oh  wait when you turn him into a vegetable then theres gonna be frivolous lawsuits  you know what would be better contrast mri   do we have one of those  you cant do an mri  if the bullet fragments magnetic theyll move and rip his brain apart  well lets flip a coin heads mri tails he dies  the police issue kevlar vests dont have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet they would just catch it  so the bullet shattered on its own  meaning baby shoes was using 38 caliber hollow points  which unfortunately are ferromagnetic  its just so cool you know that  we could do an angio to find the clotting  waste of time  the skull creates too much artifact well never get a decent view   next best thing to an mri  and a waste of time   angio might show  oh god its a coup  fine go do your angio when youre done wasting your time meet me down in the morgue  were going to snake a catheter in your femoral artery and up into your brain so we can check for clots  keep this on throughout the procedure  unless the pots already made you sterile  i have a stressful job you got no idea  i grew up with cops like you  one part bully nine parts hypocrite  cameron what is wrong with you  just having some fun   that man is sick and scared  the mans a crooked cop  maybe you should take yourself off the case foreman  dont have to like someone to be their doctor   hey how you doing there buddy  just sit still and well have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time  happy  house what did the angio tell us  what are you looking for  i called my mom she didnt pick up  what did the angio tell us  that foreman should be off this case  house hes a neurologist  unless you think the patients optic nerve is in his spleen  he doesnt like cops  foreman policemen are our friends  if you and i ever get separated shopping  i was just busting the guys chops  see he was just busting the guys chops  foreman is essential to solving this case  medically what did the angio tell us  appears to be some clotting possibly around the circle of willis  based on the progression of symptoms  the clot is growing we need to cut into  saying there appears to be clotting is like saying theres a traffic jam ahead  is it a 10car pileup or just a really slow bus in the center lane  and if it is a bus is it a thrombotic bus or an embolic bus  think  i pushed that metaphor too far  angio cant tell us that kind of information  oh so youre saying its just a waste of time  it gave us some information without killing him  you dont know that an mri will kill him  the bullets have a ferrous base  little tiny pieces trapped in his head theyre not going anywhere  maybe its worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments  surgeons say inoperable or the patients on blood thinners other than that perfect planning  you got a better plan  m uch    bullets identical to the one that baby shoes popped joe with  lets see how magnetic it is  did anybody hear a  i shot him hes dead  the bullet split into four fragments no exit wounds  only used a half load of gunpowder  we wont be exactly precise comparing the locationon an xray to an mri  how unprofessional was foreman  as him yourself hes right here  cameron worse than usual better than you  he berated joe for being a bad cop  berated or humiliated  im not sure i didnt have my thesaurus with me  one implies that he took pleasure in it  i wanna know if it was repressed black anger or just giddiness  whoa whoa you think im sick  i think that an appropriate response to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly  but the fact that ive grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing   dr foreman dr chase requests your assistance  i cant even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse  well if id shot a live person theres a lot more paperwork  then it wont be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head  the man donated his body to science  yes its a tragedy  if i hadnt shot him his body could have spent the next year letting firstyear med students use the carpool lane  hes set  do not turn that on house  youre mad because i put a bullet in his head  at worst all im doing now is taking it out  my bad  ahem  they have to uh shut down the magnet to fix it  mri is gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks  well it doesnt matter we obviously cant use it on this patient  no but there are other doctors in this hospital and other patients  that helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment  im sure im pulling my weight  is doing nothing an option  im just saying maybe the clot will break up on its own the giddiness seems to have gone away  the blindness hasnt  echo his heart  looking for what the problem is obviously neurological  the clots are in his brain the source of the clots may not be  do a complete transthoratic echocardiogram  maybe we get lucky maybe the clots are coming from his heart  chase hearts clean  where else can we look  we could ultrasound his legs look for a dvt  i need you to move over  joe you okay   tachycardia heart rate 150 and rising   saline wide open  hes bleeding out  house wanted to thin his blood sure did a good job  bps crashing hes going into shock  intracranial bleeding we need to relieve the pressure  we need a surgical team    foreman get out  boy is he screwed we clot his blood he dies  we thin it he dies   am i the only one who finds this funny    oh man  im not sick  did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain  and had to have a hole drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure   hilarious  someone laughs theyre dying   thats absurd  but not funny  if im not sick all youre doing is locking meup with the source ill get sick prove you right  if youre not sick its not contagious youve got nothing to worry about  if you are sick the two of you are staying in here until we find out why  so you might want to make friends with the pig  good news is i can finally get my mri  no you cant  you blew up the machine  not the portable one chuckles  chase and cameron are bringing it to scan your nonbulletriddled head  whwhere are you going  to the office got work to do  eat your meals take your temperature every half hour and any meds i command you to take  so im just a regular patient now  no  you get your own thermometer    check your blood  anyone with an elevated sed rate gets to be foremans new roomie   he should be a part of this  hes a patient   hes not irrational  hes not objective  hes got the most motivation to get this diagnosed  right youre not even friends with him why would you care  theres an area of increased t2 attenuation in the cingulate cortex  kind ofmushy  cingulate cortex controls emotions  this mushy spot explains the euphoria question is whats causing the mush  question you might want to ask a neurologist  foreman is a selfish jerk but hes a neurologist  and hes the only one whos been in that apartment  this is why he shouldnt be here  you wouldnt call him a jerk if he was here  if you think he screwed up at that apartment youd keep it to yourself   no i  well well never know  but as long as hes not here hes just like any other patient  which means we can dump on him all we want  whats eating the selfish jerks brain  west nile or eastern equine encephalitis  test foremans blood  given that hes the only one who got it  persontoperson transmission is less likely than some sort of deadly toxin foreman picked up at the guys home  who wants to go next  whoa  youre ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy who doesnt consider you a friend  hes just a patient right  its the job  hey  you dont have to go anywhere  joes apartment is right downstairs in the lab  foreman brought back samples of everything  what was that who wants to go next  some kind of test  dont worry you made the right call  foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing  hes way smarter than you are  ow  damn chase   you suck at this  sorry its this damn suit  i can do it myself and ill throw that out  whatd the mri show  i cant be a part of the differential and i cant even know what the differential is  youd  tell any other patient what you found out  mri showed a lesion on your cingulate cortex  whats the thinking  toxins are in the lead virals a distant second  do you think the lesion could be an abscess  its just a small soft area more mush than  was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles  there was an increased signal there yeah  what are you thinking  staph infection toxins lead to neurodegeneration which causes the lesion   not without a fever  the cop had a fever  mine could be coming i could have got it directly from him or a dirty dish towel at his place  give us omaya reservoirs deliver linezolid directly into our brains  and were cured  samples tested negative for toluene arsenic and lead  house what about the blood  negative for west nile and eastern equine  we have to go back to joes apartment get more samples  no one goes back to that place till we know what were looking for  get some of that cop tape stick it over the doors and the windows  ill take all the hazmat precautions the chance of infection is next to nothing  yeah i was never that great at math but next to nothing is  higher than nothing right  its not your fault he got sick  it would be his fault if we did  we should get a sample directly from joes brain  we cant do a biopsy theres too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin  well i dont think this is the time to be pointing fingers  i didnt give foreman any  you want to give foreman a brain biopsy  come on really who doesnt  this could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration   without a fever not a chance  joe had a fever  he also had legionella  the mush might be forming an abscess  and since there was inflammation of the lining of the ventricles it makes sense  the staph releasestoxins causes neurodegeneration causes a lesion  this is a waste of time  we should put an omaya reservoir in foremans brain and start administering antibi  if im gonna be arguing with foreman i may as well do it directly    kernigs sign negative  brudzinskis sign single positive    patient joe luria distal and proximal arm contractures duration four seconds    staph infection most commonly presents on the skin  most commonly  you wanna treat me like any other patient do it  but the house i know never uses phrases like most commonly  youre not laughing anymore  no  think thats a good thing  sorta doubt it  staph would be in your heart lungs spleen liver or kidneys before it gets to your brain  your organs are clear its not staph  the infection could be limited to a brain abscess  which i would have seen in your mri  sign this so that i can take out a piece of your brain  let me see the mri  there was no abscess on the image  let me see it then  i liked you better when you were jolly  mri was taken over an hour ago that soft spot could now be an abscess  if it was staph youd have a fever which you dont   what idiot gave you that  put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph    foreman triangle  this one  uhcircle  next  foreman why arent you answering is there a problem  uh ssquare  house tell me your date of birth   is that house  chase yeah next  a square again why is he here  because my neurologist is having surgery  thought i was just another patient  you didnt believe that crap did you  date of birth  the omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe  my spatial recognition is the issue not my memory  oops did you say omaya i could have sworn you said biopsy  hey im just messing with your head  mothers maiden name please  get out of my temporal lobe house  hello  are you awake  they told me somebody was sick like me  im up  your voice  arent you my doctor  not anymore  youre the guy who doesnt like cops  yeah  can you see  you cant  not a thing  youve been blind a while the fact that youre aware of it now  it could be a sign of improvement  aah  it hurts so much doesnt it  im okay  its gonna hurt  the morphine barely takes the edge off  im gonna die arent i  you die i die its not gonna happen  why not youre just too stubborn to die  they took a piece of my brain  whatevers wrong with us theyll find  do you believe in prayer  not really  neither do i  my dad always prays  so does mine  do you wanna try it  try prayin  okay  how is he  still dying  well youve almost mastered another skill though thats good  foremans biopsy results  nonspecific signs of inflammation  thats it  we also swabbed for staph negative hes not even a carrier  well at least foreman was wrong too  yeah theres that  can i go to joes apartment now  no  go back to the lab  start retesting all the samples that foreman collected   for what  everything  bacteria toxins fungus anything that likes to feast on brain   thats thousands of  better hurry  cameron suit up youre gonna monitor foreman  hes onto hand contractures hell be in antons blindness soon  run hourly checks because when he does go blind he wont be able to tell us  well use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind joe he is  why are you still here  youre being cautious  youre being  common  when you dont give a crap about  how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients  let me know when that happens then we can have this conversation  its just another case huh  i bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing  boy i wish i had your job    biopsy showed nothing  how can there be nothing you cut out a piece of my brain  its nothing personal we just didnt find anything  can you up his morphine for gods sake  hes already maxed out  what about toxins  everything was negative  there was a cupboard above the stove did you see it  i didnt check all the food but could be listeriosis  we didnt go back follow right  who did  house said we shouldnt go too dangerous  the answers gotta be in that apartment not going is too dangerous  im sorry  youre thankful  if house would have pointed at you instead of me youd be the one in here  look straight forward tell me when you can see  its your job to go back youre a doctor you go where the disease is  say when you can see the light  im dying and youre sitting here measuring how fast i go   tell me when you can see the light  my visions fine  your leftside periphery is reduced  its fine ill prove it  ow son of a bitch  now were both exposed  you got two choices  you can go tell house what just happened  and get your own cot board in here or you can go back to that apartment  you save me the cop and yourself  its not sspe  i checked your past vaccinations against joes no batch matches  blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus  guys could you please shut him up   hes over his limit on morphine  wheres cameron  she said she has some stuff to do said shed be back soon    chase what are you doing  foreman  joe stop i cant take it  imagine being constantly reminded of the  pain youre about to be in  i cant take it stop it   stop it stop it stop it  shh sshh  mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart  so could paininduced stress cardiomyopathy either the morphine kills him or the pain does  youre condoning this  im certainly not going in there to stop him  thatll make you feel better  aahhh aahhhhh  joe has a new symptom  hyperalgesia  the infections spreading to the pain center of the brain  ohh ohh make it stop make it stop  his brains telling him that his whole bodys in pain  and because of the location the painkillers do nothing  suit up put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him  what if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell  aureobasidium fungus could grow there  did you find any cedarwood anywhere   no but maybe  maybe what  maybe somebody could go back take a second look  and why arent you pissed off that camerons playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance  why doesnt anyone listen to me anymore  i decided you were wrong  god youre weak  guy steals your article  tells you youre not his friend  and you still want to risk your life for him  foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle   wow  yeah  god youre weak  guy tried to kill you  first thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back  shoot him  ive got a gun in my desk  last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it  and then give the bastard everything he wanted  im not here for foreman im here to save myself  mmm  even with a needle stick your chances of infection are pretty slim  thats why youre wearing the suit  you wanted to be here  he just gave you the excuse  what does that guy have to do to make you hate him  give me the bag   mildewed dish towel  to retest for staph  what is that mouse droppings  hamster droppings could carry toxocara explain the blindness  now that i recognize as oven crud  could be meat with trichinella would explain the high fever  whats with rye bread  mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning which would explain the contractures  there are three loaves  so  youre going back in there  guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye  thats looking too far into the future  house unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet  you on the roof yet  yeah im here i dont see any birds  house whistle or something  do that comehither thing    whoa  house they came that fast because its their behavior pattern  joes been feeding them  now look down you see a river of pigeon turd  uhno theres barely any  its not weird its cheap  joes a guy who looks for the easy way  probably been stealing cable from his neighbors  why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings  you see a shovel or a dustpan  mmm found a scraper looks used  sitting on a bucket  bucket full of pigeon crap  perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans  yep  fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus  where it dances its triple threat of happiness blindness and intractable pain  lets hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson  dont cut corners when youre growing your pot  see you back home  i was there  i should have found it  yeah you could have saved us a lot of time  get me a flush of ampho band flucytosine  ill start us both  i was waiting for lab confirmation havent heard from house yet   look at his eeg  theta bands been increasing steadily sincesince weput him under  guys unconscious but still in pain  theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things  one of which is pain  the fact that hes no longer screaming makes us feel better not necessarily him  chase  hows cameron  shes not giddy    fevers down white counts improving  has she said anything to you  you mean like i completely understand why foreman did what he did and i hold no grudge  what i did  did save my life    get in here and help forget the suit  hes tachycardic widecomplex looks like vtach   its not cryptococcus  what  house was wrong the samples were negative   so what is it  we dont know  give him in the amio   do we have any more leads  that was our lead foreman  so the treatment isnt doing anything  foreman hes in vfib  no good hit him again  come on man come on joe  hit him again  uhh  chase give him an amp of epi  nothing  hes has multiplesystemfailure  foreman  come on joe  foreman  foreman time of death  no  time of death   come on  joe
