at the same time  the nurse will be in soon to take some blood id like to run some more tests   thank you doctor  thank you  where is everybody no ones in the office  no i havent heard from cameron all day you seen house   look for a shallow grave with vogler standing over it  you have a stage iv cancer  its metastasized to your liver    theres a new drug called in phase ii trials  its your best shot  thank you doctor  youve been so good to me and  well l i did  publicly bash your companys drug  when i think about how i treated you  oh hey come on  there there there  so um there is some hope  always  but just in case i specialordered an extrajumbosized coffin  hey  dont thank me its just who i am  hey  up and at em big guy    sorry up late internet porn  how come youre not in your office  because there is a computer in my office and if i log on romance will ensue   my wrist might fall off  hiding cause voglers looking for you huh  thats just pathetic  i dont like loud angry giants threatening me with violence how is that pathetic  you think you can avoid firing one of us by hiding out here  hell find you sooner or later  im okay with later    g four p zero  three miscarriages  gimme altered mental status and complete loss of coordination  tox screen negative for alcohol and drugs  she was on oxybutynin for incontinence  yeah well we took her off no change bun and creatinine are up lfts slightly elevated  preeclampsia call the obgyn service and rub some prayer beads   bps normal no preeclampsia in other pregnancies  because she didnt carry for long enough  the three miscarriages make me think its an underlying physiology  pregnancyrelated autoimmunity  too bad that cameron quit  we could use an immunologist right now   well see if youre right check the blood  cameron quit  last night  and do an mra for vasculitis too  theres no way she quit  she got fired because you couldnt swallow your pride  an ultrasound excellent thought  and put her on magnesium too in case it is preeclampsia  sure  here pussy pussy pussy  i didnt do anything exactly my point   you wanted me to yell at him  what would that have achieved was he gonna jump into his time machine and fix everything  when a dog dumps on the floor do you pat its head no you smack it in the nose with a newspaper  dogs can learn things house cant  coward child  hey there  i uh brought my colleague along to help out hi im dr chase  hi  well ultrasound looks good no sign of fetal distress  so its not preeclampsia  well it still could be but it hasnt progressed at least  were gonna put you on bed rest and monitor the baby  okay well give you some potassium and magnesium as well  we should keep the fluids running  and check her again in an hour unless there are signs of fetal distress honey  shes choking   lean forward     is she all right  probably just some muscle weakness   what do you mean probably  naomi open up  people choke it could be nothing    you all right    i cant i cant i cant even swallow   she gets sick a lot  like this this cold got really bad all of a sudden  and the fever   shh its okay  its not a cold its pneumonia   pneumonia  relax pneumonias her second biggest problem  she has gone from the 25th weight percentile to the third in one month  im not a baby expert but im pretty sure theyre not supposed to shrink  well theres this diet we put her on when she stopped breastfeeding  but its healthy um raw food were vegans  almond milk tofu uh vegetables  raw food  if only her ancestors had mastered the secret of fire  babies need fat proteins calories less important sprouts and hemp  starving babies is bad and illegal in many cultures   im having her admitted  is she gonna be all right  antibiotics for the pneumonia iv feeding to get the weight up  dont worry its a vegan iv    dont see any signs of vasculitis  odd  since youre always right about everything  could be a different autoimmunity  or you could bite me   oh no   naomi you okay  no i cant im getting cramps  strong oh yeah feels like my miscarriage  stop preterm labor  hes too little he wont survive  shes on magnesium already fluids and terbutaline then   were gonna give you some medicine okay try to stop your labor  okay  okay  oh ah  there you are been looking everywhere for you  uh listen you said that i had to cut one of my people  if i didnt give that speech about your drug  and uh in fairness to your point of view  my speech really wasnt the one you had in mind so ive cut cameron  now were all squared away right  in the morning i expect you  in my office with your letter of resignation  and plans for a public apology  otherwise ill destroy you  so thats a no on us being squared away   she might make it to full term  contractions are less frequent and not well organized  great to see you back in the office i guess vogler found you  yeah we had a nice little chat  i really should have kept cameron   she knew where to find the sugar  its what i said preeclampsia   a little stress from the mra she pops right into labor  aha   what about the myasthenia  come on she didnt seem that weak  she choked she couldnt even swallow   what did she choke on  her food  but muscle weakness isnt a symptom of preeclampsia   what kind of food  a little bit of cooked pear doesnt matter shows weakness  she choked on soft wet pear  did she forget to take the bones out  thats way past muscle weakness   did you do an upper endoscopy  you think theres something obstructing her esophagus   we gotta talk  ooh we gotta talk  and check her eyelids  check her eyelids  special board meeting today only one item on the agenda you  enjoy the bagels im untouchable   right  any vote to revoke my tenure has to be unanimous ive got you and maybe even cuddy  well that settles it mr ruthless corporate raider  will be totally stymied go home curl up on the floor of his shower and weep  what can he do i got a contract  does it say how much your team is paid  where you parking space is if your car should be filled with horse manure  voglers smart hes got some plan to get you  does it involve candy cause im a sucker for chocolates     shes doing better  oh thank god  technically alexander fleming he developed antibiotics  pneumonias under control  from now on what say you go with human food okay   absolutely swear to god  this time thats your guy  rachel and joel kaplan  yes youre under arrest  you have the right to remain silent what did we do  youre being charged with child endangerment   what how  starving your kid im from social services  were taking responsibility for your baby    this is how voglers gonna destroy me   what did he do grease your cane  he had my patients arrested  uh no he didnt i did  the nurses were concerned and they called me  there was evidence of abuse you took a big legal risk by not calling social services  those parents are not abusive theyre idiots  oh well thats certainly a relief  it was my call you made the wrong one  you know theres a new biography of quisling i think you might like it  sure no idea who that is  uh norwegian guy world war ii traitor   the fact that i have to explain this takes the edge off my flow  i was protecting you  from what cops arent gonna bust me  disciplinary committee maybe gives me a slap on the wrist  and vogler has an excuse to get rid of you  if i dont give him one he makes one up voglers just one vote  hes gotta convince the other 11 of us  im just trying to stop you from making that extra easy   dr charles dial 4541  sean do your wifes eyelids look any different than usual  uh maybe one is drooping a little bit  but you know shes tired so  naomi can you open your mouth for me and um tilt your head back  this is gonna be a little uncomfortable   yeah theres swelling indenting the esophagus  is that why she choked   well need to do an xray  what no the baby you said no xrays  its important  she has a threecentimeter mass  in her right upper lobe  maybe its a granuloma no theres no calcification  its smallcell lung cancer  the tumors starting to press against your esophagus  it hasnt metastasized but it has spread to other parts of your lung so we cant operate  wait that doesnt make sense  she had uh kidney failure and brain problems  some cancer patients get what are called paraneoplastic syndromes  you were making antibodies to fight the tumor  they got sidetracked and attacked other cells  your brain first then your liver kidneys  even the nerves that control your eyelids  thats called lamberteaton syndrome it told us the tumor was in the lungs  how bad is it  smallcell is the most aggressive kind of lung cancer  the fiveyear survival rate is only about 10 to 15  which is why we have to start you on chemo and radiation right away   radiation what about the baby  youll need a csection before you can start the treatment  i can get you in first thing tomorrow morning  what are the chances my baby will survive  pretty good twentyeight weeks so about 80  no wait thats oneinfive chance hell die  i really wouldnt advise waiting   naomi you gotta start this treatment right away  what happens if i wait  well 29 weeks the survival rate is closer to 90  im not doing the radiation but youll die if  listen you know the chances theyre nothing  but a few more weeks will save the baby  listen youre depressed right now and youre not thinking right so  could you j tell her please  this cancer moves quick the median survivals two to four months  if you postpone even for a week  im sorry honey  as most of you know gregory house recently gave a speech about me   id like to return the favor   sorry  dr wilson  i was hoping you were gonna miss this one  a man is the sum ofhis actions here are a few of dr houses  he violated a dnr and was charged with assault  he brought a termite into the or and spat on a surgeon  he accepted a corvette from a patient who was a known member of the new jersey mafia   ed look  edward  edward you look at anyones career you can find things that are  these are the last three months  hes personally had more complaints filed against him than any department in this hospital  okay hes screwedup hes miserable  and he should probably reread the ethics code but it works for him hes saved hundreds of lives  he is a drug addict who flaunts his addiction and refuses to get treatment  he is a disgrace and an embarrassment to this hospital  id go on but it gets kind of mean so  im gonna keep this simple  house goes or i go   you shouldnt personalize this  and by i i mean my hundred million dollars  hows that for personalizing  you gave us that money for a reason  are you really willing to throw it all away because of one doctor  gregory house is a symbol of everything wrong with the health care industry  waste insubordination  doctors preening like theyre kings and the hospital is their own private fiefdom  health care is a business im gonna run it like one  i hereby move to revoke the tenure of dr gregory house  and terminate his employment at this hospital effective immediately   dont you think we should discuss this  we just did   we need time  the vote is on the table all in favor   dr wilson opposed  the motion is defeated  dr wilson would you mind leaving the room please   excuse me  were going to take another vote  well first of all you cant void my vote by making me stand in the hallway  and second you should check the bylaws  you need notice and at least one business day before you can reconsider any matter  were voting on a different matter which you are conflicted out of  how can i be conflicted  this vote is whether to dismiss dr james wilson    naomi is refusing to have the csection  her odds arent good enough  they do suck wheres wilson  paged him twice she does this she knows shes gonna die  shes saving her child cameron would point out that people are capable of sacrifice  cameron isnt here   perhaps proving her point  you think this woman is making a rational decision  i think people can overcome their baser drives  pretty damn rarely  and not this time this is purely biological  in evolutionary terms the needs of the next generation are more important   youre saying shes making the right call  darwin is im not  the next generation is not my patient  we have to raise the odds for mommy  where the hell is wilson hes the oncologist  good plan cure cancer  im surprised no one ever thought of that before  there he is  dr house  you guys bust out we made bail they wont let us in our babys room  weird you think theyd let you take her home while they figured out if you tried to kill her  were good parents we fed her whenever she was hungry  big meals we had no idea that diet was so bad  the nutritionist said it had everything she needed listen  the kid who stacks the freerange grapefruit in your health food store is not a nutritionist  but my uncle is  he went to college and everything   foreman i need a ct scan on  olive kaplan  seriously  olive kaplan  look for abscesses or occult infections yeah  byebye  listen voglers all about clinical trials  the hospitals chock full of them  theres gotta be something for smallcell lung cancer  what are you doing  i got sacked  did you make a pass at cuddy  i told you she only has thighs for me  i voted to keep you  so hes getting rid of every board member who votes to keep me around   yeah every one of us  just you yep  but youre only off the board right  they couldnt have gotten unanimous approval for you  brown from oncology voted no so did cuddy  taylor and peavey  oh so youre off the board big deal  frees up wednesday nights for bowling  youre still a doctor getting dumped looks great in whos who  vogler gave me the option of resigning  and i took it  big of him i got no kids  my marriages sucks i only had two things that worked for me  this job and this stupid screwedup friendship  and neither mattered enough to you to give one lousy speech  they matter  if i could do it all again youd do the same thing  well youll be gone soon too  those clinical trials  ill make some calls  thanks  its its not cancer its not gonna kill me   its hemorrhoids  but all that blood i mean that cant be right  looks worse than it is   nice job of protecting me  can this wait  his ass can wait you save my job by sacking wilson  what did you think would happen when you made that speech  that you would just pout for a little while and wed all forgive you  you dont spit on the man that signs your paycheck  first cameron then wilson  youre next pull your pants up   so its about the money of course its about the money  the money vogler gave he could have bought a few jets maybe a baseball team  orjust stuck it in chase manhattan and collected interest  but he gave it to us to buy equipment to do research  you are a great doctor house but you are not worth a hundred million dollars   weve sequenced the dna of the tumor cells  p53 gene mutation at codon 55 shes perfect for your trial  hmm shes pretty far advanced  well you want easy cases you picked the wrong specialty  otherwise in good health excellent  when can she start middle of next week  cancers already stage iii itd be a waste of time she can start in two days  she cant start in two days shes pregnant  she wont be in two days   ive scheduled a csection  shed still have to wait a month  you cant take part in any trial for at least 30 days after major surgery  well its definitely surgery but major  its not your call again question of interpretation  youre scamming a doctor now  come on voglers looking for any excuse to can you  oh i think hes got a big bag of those already  these regulations arent just here to annoy you doing this is dangerous to the patient  well ill be sure and let her know that  care to join me  angiogenesis inhibitors prevent the tumors from creating blood vessels  without blood the tumor starves  that sounds great what about the baby  the treatment would be fatal to the baby  ive scheduled a csection for this afternoon no  its in the trial phase right now but so far  complete remission in more than 30 of subjects   i told dr foreman i didnt want a csection  when your chances of living were less than a third of what they are now  well if the babys premature then  our pediatrics department has the best neonatal icu in the state  no his lungs his brain hes not ready  and he could be fine you dont know what its like raising a sick child   his odds are much better than yours are  you have to let them at least try this   talk to her  okay  leave the room  okay  how long have you been taking oxybutynin  uh since i was about 20  incontinence is pretty uncommon in a woman of your age  its even more bizarre in a woman in her 20s  i guess i havent had the best luck when it comes to my health  seems that way  you said to your husband you dont know what its like raising a sick child  you didnt say  you dont know what it would be like  this is not your first child is it  and he doesnt know  i was 18  i got pregnant got married  i had the most beautiful little girl grace  she had infantile alexanders disease  im sorry two years we watched her die  my husband was a uh my first husband was a  a great guy  but after that i couldnt even look at him without thinking of her  i left him  i left my job i left everything very moving story  explains why youre being so selfish  im willing to die to protect my husband  because its what you want your husband wants you to live  well he doesnt understand oh who the hell does  tragedies happen  if you think that turning yourself into a disposable incubator for a few weeks  is gonna protect your baby from all the crap in this world go ahead  die happy i got no problem with people killing themselves  but dont think it makes you a hero  okay  youre scheduled for 400 pm  yes this is dr lim    count down from 10  okay  ten  nine  eight   tray setup that seemed kind of fast is she all right  shes fine  wake her up that was vogler surgery is off    hey youre killing her  really i thought you were the one trying to ram her into a drug trial five minutes after surgery  she knows the risk she was fully informed  well the guy running the study sure wasnt not his life not his call   his study his call  right so she kicks off his numbers look bad  the numbers look bad the study looks bad  which would cost you money and keep a lifesaving protocol off the market  one person one blip in the data  ever heard of the fda they eat blips for breakfast  one person should never endanger thousands  well thank god you were here to save all those lives    the boards meeting again this evening  why dont you settle down play some game boy  why dont you watch your soap  i hear theyre firing the handsome doctor today boy that should be a good one  if we had the csection anyway  she could still do the experimental treatment right   wed just have to wait 30 days  assuming the doctor running the trial isnt too pissed off to let her in  and assuming im even healthy enough to   honey     are you okay   sats are dropping down to the 80s stay with us naomi  whats going on  we need you to leave the room  respiratory distress   could you tell me whats going on  were trying to find out     here still kicking  flash pulmonary edema  lungs are clear here it is   pulmonary embolus  gotta get her to an or   now right away  uh what happened  its an embolism a blood clot fairly common with lung cancer  its not a full saddle embolism so bloods still trickling through weve been able to get naomi breathing a little  but we need to remove the clot and we need you to approve the treatment of course  whatever you have to do just do it its not that simple  the best course for the baby would be an immediate csection the longer we postpone  the greater chance hell have brain damage from lack of oxygen fine just do it  heres the problem  the csection would be very very dangerous for naomi dangerous like  in her current condition theres a real chance she wont survive  im sorry  your wifes unconscious we need you to make a decision  i just want her to live  no csection  sats are still way down we gotta push the streptokinase  too risky even if it dissolves the clot she could still bleed out   shes hemodynamically compromised  its not good for the baby  dad doesnt care  bolusing 250000 units   bps dropping  pressors dont have time weve gotta suck it out    systolic bps 80  bps stabilizing  o2 sats rising   did you get the clot  i think so  shes stabilized how long was her oxygen at that level   about 10 minutes  brain function compromised  shouldnt be but well   bps dropping up the dopamine   shes not responding how much  up to 30 micrograms   is she septic  shes bleeding into her abdomen  we wont be able to stop it   ill go talk to the husband  no you stay here keep her as stable as you can for as long as you can  she had trauma during the procedure  shes bleeding into her abdomen  theres nothing we can do im sorry  oh no  i need you to okay the csection thats gonna kill her right  probably will  i cant do that  shes dying either way   im im sorry  stay with me sean i need your okay on this  she makes the decisions and im  right and thats gonna be tough from now on but this decision is easy  you know what shed want yeah  i cant do you make this call only two things change  one yeah you feel guilty for killing your wife two your baby lives  naomis baby lives  okay okay   hes out umbilical cords clamped    no respiration   his lungs arent opening up  they arent mature   come on take a breath you know you can do it     what you got  looks like vfib  pulse   no paddles   right here  come on come on   clear     nothing  charging   good boy open up  hows he doin  still not breathing weve gotta intubate  clear        thank you  im late for the board meeting we need to talk  i dont want to hear it its about a patient  the pregnant woman she wasnt qualified for that trial and im not gonna apologize  im not talking about her at this point i think its best if i concentrate on patients who are still alive  pulmonary embolism she bled out saved her son  this is olive kaplans ct scan the incredible shrinking baby  her thymus gland  digeorge syndrome its genetic caused the gland to wither to nothing  this is why she couldnt gain weight yeah  ill call the police and social services and have all the charges withdrawn  ive sent a test down to confirm when it comes back you should start olive on immunoglobulin replacement  youre not gonna do it  well i assume i wont be here    your boy is doing good   its the same motion as yesterday people same reasons  all those in favor of dismissing gregory house raise a hand   dr cuddy  you realize this is going to happen   i cant do it  you cant abstain  im not abstaining im voting no  youve changed your mind since yesterday  what did he do buy you dinner and roses threaten to drown your dog   he did his job  right  he saved another life  maybe good for him   its great its not the point  its what we do  and you could do it a lot better if you didnt have to worry about some madman  running around the hospital accountable to no one   but thats not the choice youre giving us  house wont listen to anyone  and youre not accountable to anybody either because you think you own us  i move for the immediate dismissal of dr lisa cuddy   shes upset we all are  why would you risk your career to save him  if you think house deserves to go if you think i deserve to go  wilson deserved to go then vote yes  but if youre doing this because you are afraid of losing his money then hes right  he does own you  you have a choice maybe the last real one youll have here         cuddy is a genius  convincing four people to give up a fortune to save our sorry asses    dr cuddy the man of the hour   hey hey  hey what are you doing  were drinking i would have thought that was pretty obvious  to the great champion saved you  saved wilson saved the whole team  of course none of them would have needed saving if you could actually get along with another human being  thank you miss buzz kill  well you only cost us a hundred million dollars  could have saved some lives  could have made a fewjobs helped a few peopleyippee  you voted to get rid of him  the lesser of two evils  you should be mourning  i know i am  thats some bad hat harry
