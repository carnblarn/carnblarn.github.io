some of these dates   the first diagnosis  schizophrenia  dr walters may 11 last year the letters in the medical file  and april 6 that was the last day she worked  but she received unemployment benefits for that week  we fixed that i know we did we returned the money  thats the canceled check  not the real one you know its a copy  and youre the dependent  no thats my little brother im 18just helping out  youre all set  just need a signature   hey im talking to you  the cats first now its your turn lucy  shut up shut up shut up  its okay shejust shejust needs a little water is all  ill go get it  just hold on okay just  when she comes back sign it and were gonna be done we need this okay please   okay  the voices  the voices arent real    what    mom mom  mom mom mom   thirtyeightyearold caucasian woman status postrespiratory arrest in the field  intubated oxygenating poorly     dr gregory house please call dr cuddy at extension 3731  this is a good hospital  depends what you mean by good i like these chairs  how is she stable okay  your mom had a small pulmonary embolism  a blood clot that got stuck in her lungs blocked the oxygen  but the pain started in her leg where the clot started her calf  its called a deep vein thrombosis basically a bigger clot  it never hurt there before i would have noticed  a piece of that broke off went up the vein through her heart and blocked the blood flow to her lungs  no blood flow no oxygen okay  is your dad here i have some things i need to talk to him about uh my dads running a little late  hes dead just talk to me i take care of her  all right your moms blood alcohol was12  i gave it to her two ounces of vodka it cools her out  but thats the first since monday that was three days ago  ive been real careful  she hears voices shes schizophrenic that explains the dvt  the alcohol makes her pass out shes immobile for long periods of time  that doesnt happen shes not an alcoholic she only drinks when you give it to her  we put her on blood thinners you can probably take her home tomorrow  its not the alcohol its gotta be something else  of course its the alcohol  hello  this guys a professional doctor  plays golf and everything i bet  hes not gonna tell you your moms an alcoholic without proof  im sure he scoped for varices checked her esophagus ran all kinds of blood tests  doctors like this they dont make assumptions they do the work  id be happy to refer you the case dr house you seem so interested  what case its over youre sending her home   how old is she  youre a doctor  own my own stethoscope  did i ask you how old she was i forget  a 38yearold woman with no previous symptoms or history  presents with deep vein thrombosis  how did she get it  oral contraceptives smoking diabetes obesity whats the point here  a dvt is a dvt put her on iv heparin to prevent future clots   whats the big mystery  fine youre all sleepy you need a clue  shes 38 years old  shes 20 years too young to get a deep vein thrombosis  i treated a 12yearold girl once a soccer player she got kicked in the leg  there was no trauma none of the risk factors you took a history  i have some notes theyre not mine but reliable i think for the purposes of this discussion  as for the immobility well shes real active right now of course paranoia keeps her limber   paranoia  oh yeah shes schizophrenic  and her kid wrote this so it might be a little biased  you know having to take care of his nutso mom and all  you think theres a connection   do we include schizophrenia in the differential for d vt  well  the answer is no  abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots  schizophrenia is not the cause of dvt  on the other hand we dont really know anything about schizophrenia so maybe it is connected  well schizophrenia explains one mystery  why youre so fascinated by a woman with a bump in her leg  its like picasso deciding to whitewash a fence thanks im more of a leroy neiman man  and it is only about the dvt shes 38 years old she shouldnt  right solve this one and youre on your way to stockholm we dont even know how to treat it  come on fumigation of the vagina  a little louder i dont think everyone heard you  two thousand years ago thats how galen treated schizophrenics the marcus welby of ancient greece  oh clearly youre not interested oh im interested  im interested in how voices in the head could be caused by malposition of the uterus theres a better place for it  now what do we got weve got lobotomies rubber rooms electric shocks  my galen was so primitive where are you going  going to see the patient that allimportant human connection thought id give it a whirl  you wont talk to patients because they lie  but give you a patient with no concept of reality  if it wasnt for socrates that raving untreated schizophrenic we wouldnt have the socratic method  the best way of teaching everything apart from juggling chain saws  without isaac newton wed be floating on the ceiling dodging chain saws no doubt  and that guitar player in that english band he was great  you think im interested because of the schizophrenia  yeah im pretty sure  galen was pretty sure about the fumigation thing  pink floyd   mom this is dr gr  gregory house  nice to meet you  would it be all right if we spoke alone for a while   well youre gonna need me to  ive got your case notes doctor  theres a cafeteria downstairs  get yourself whatever you want  as long as theres enough left over for a reuben sandwich dry no fries hold the pickles  should run you about 580 with tax  ill page you when were done  no  pickles  nice kid  how much do you really drink  hes really talking to a patient  i dont know who i am anymore  its a blood clot whats so fascinating about that  he likes crazy people he likes the way they think  they think badly thats the definition of crazy  why would he like theyre not boring  he likes that  and the meds  baseball i like baseball  very nice very sad  my boy and me we went to see a game  not mets meds medicine  you take what he tells you to take  no one believes me  i do  i thought he liked rationality  he likes puzzles  patients are puzzles you dont think so  i think theyre people yeah  well he hates them and hes fascinated by them  tell me you cant relate to that sentiment    you told luke it never hurt before just rough  they didnt hurt  didnt  dont lie to him limpy  lively lucy never lies to lucas  look what i do to him   radiation therapist to oncology  learn anything from the human connection  yeah the mets suck  also for the last two months she hasnt shaved her legs because of the tremors she cuts herself   the tremors arent new she must always cut herself  exactly  something changed in the last two months  im thinking the amount of blood when she cut herself so lets start with some blood work  collect and send for clotting studies pt ptt factor five protein c and s  the whole shebang good luck  no pickles and its cold now   if its a reuben thats the way he likes it  everyone this is luke   allison cameron its nice to finally meet you  yeah save it were busy  luke give us another half hour with your mom we need to do some tests  nice kid  take her off the psych meds that way well know whats what on the physical side  and who knows we might get more out of her  dont worry no pickles  happy birthday  okay whose  i was going through your mail and it was on a form happy birthday  oh  no no blood not mine  for the test dr house told us   youre gonna steal it sell it no no blood  no no blood no no blood  haldol five milligrams stat  no no no  no no   no no oh no   nno    no      well good news the lab says its not strep so were done  wait a second no really not strep  the boys in the lab sure theyre hard drinkers but theyre pros you know  plus your kid actually has none of the symptoms for strep  it was quicker running the test than arguing with you my point is go  i just wanted to ask your opinion doctor  shes having a birthday party next week and shes upset that im getting a sugarless cake  the other kids hate it this is why youre here  sugar is the leading cause of obesity in america  you want a doctor to scare her about the dangers of sugar  she needs to get her weight under control  well you know i feel sorry for those other kids wendy who dont have a mom like yours  a mom who knows that sugar causes heart disease appendicitis and athletes foot  thats not fair oh yes it is no i get it  you want her to slim down a little so she can wear pretty clothes like yours  love the bracelets  hey what about matching outfits you could be twins   she cant be your daughter  its impossible you look way too young  happy birthday  get the kid a damned ice cream cake   dr wyland to obstetrics dr wyland obstetrics   you drugged her  actually i didnt  ive taken her off all medication your guy foreman gave her haldol  we needed blood for tests i assumed that was the only way to get it  he knocked her out look i have a cane and i know how to use it  i hired you you work for me  okay  can i go now boss  the haldol changes her  she says it makes her soul numb dont give it to her  if there be rags enough  he will know her name and be well pleased remembering it    you okay  old days  for in the old days  though she had young mens praise and old mens blame  among the poor both old and young gave her praise     oh  help somebody help  so when i said no psych meds im just curious which word didnt you understand  the haldol had nothing to do with the bleed  you know that i used it purely as a chemical restraint  oh great well thats good to hear  so she wont experience any of those pesky little side effects you get when your motives arent pure  oh those side effects are so rare  what passing out increased confusion depression thats not gonna happen  thats not gonna screw up our diagnosis cause you just used it to restrain her im so relieved  she spit in my face   that must have been so frightening for you  what was i supposed to do tie her down yeah anything but give her drugs  thats basically my point  the clotting studies pretty fast did you promise to date the entire lab  no i save that for emergencies  i told them she bled out two units and if it happened again shed die  if it had happened at home she would have died  the er doc he was gonna send her home   i used my bestjudgment  it turns out your best judgment is not good enough   heres an idea next time use mine  i think theyre choosing a movie  why did the patient bleed out  the clotting studies so far are normal  well cover your ears if you dont want me to spoil the ending  everything was normal except for a prolonged pt time   which means what  usually it means whoever drew the blood didnt do it right  oh thats right cause you drew the blood   but you were precise because you knew the tube was purely for the pt study  thats right  and im right with you i trust this result for two reasons  a because you are a good doctor  and b because five milligrams of iv haldol  makes for a spectacularly cooperative patient  the prolonged pt time makes me think shes got a vitamin k deficiency   vitamin kwould explain the bleed but not the clot  without vitamin k protein c doesnt work without protein c she clots  clotting and thinning all at the same time  what about another drug interacting with heparin an antibiotic like ampicillin  that would cause the bleed clever but shes not on ampicillin  two months ago she complained of a sore throat and he got her ampicillin   which she refused to take  hejust said she didnt take it  what is it everybody lies except for schizophrenics and their children  its more likely than malnourishment why not scurvy or the plague  gee i wish my idea was as cool and withit as yours  what is yours by the way do you have one alcohol  simple it causes immobility which explains the dvt  it also causes cirrhosis which explains the bleed and the prolonged pt time   lets ultrasound the liver   three theories  check out her place for ampicillin and diet  then ultrasound her liver  lets find out whos right before she bleeds to death   so house says the kid is sensitive thinks he takes good care of her  but if we dont find anything why let him know we did it in the first place  whats the point  why not just make old foreman lift the key from the kids backpack  looks like luke sleeps in the living room  nothing in there  he lays out her clothes  enough organization enough lists you think you can control the uncontrollable  fix her meds fix her clothes maybe you can even fix her  pick that up on your psych rotation  trifluoperazine thorazine clozarile  whew they tried everything  the ampicillin never touched it  there goes camerons theory oh god i hope its not a vitamin k deficiency   damn  breakfast lunch and dinner  house was right    thats the only thing shell eat yeah  the problem is you cant actually live on this stuff  i checked it out i looked on the box all the nutritional values are solid  theres plenty of protein and calories  yeah vitamin a and c but no k thats why your mom got sick  so whats the plan then load her up with vitamin k  thats it if it all checks out you can take her home in a couple of days    oh god youre upset about something  youre gonna open up to me now arent you its all my fault  here we go  okay im gonna say this once you have done a very good job taking care of your mother  if this was all shed eat then what else could you do gosh just being a kid is a fulltime job  shut up im 18 i should be able to take care of my mom  i almost killed her good example  just the time it takes to express those ridiculous selfcentered teenage ideas  i dont envy your schedule  no pickles  my mom doesnt like em either  smart woman  before she got sick i didnt like how bossy she was  always telling me what to do the right way to do it   never thought id miss that  oww   you should get that looked at  i still dont buy a vitamin k deficiency house was right  that usually makes you happy less work for us  the kid feeds his mom a steady diet of booze and the problem is too many burgers  the kids in a tough situation you do what you gotta do to survive  feeding alcohol to an alcoholic is not a survival technique  where i come from if it works yeah right  im rich i couldnt possibly understand what this kid is going through  just because youre drinking pricier stuff doesnt mean you dont have a problem  youve seen someone stagger down that road  no way vitamin k is the whole story   its not broken  see this right here  its the epiphyseal plate otherwise known as the growth plate whats wrong with it  amazing thing this bone  if you know how to read it it can tell you how old someone really is   exactly how old  great  mmm not even 15  almost though  two weeks away maybe a month  last week i was 15 last week  happy birthday to both of us  if youre gonna lie though go big go 21  that way you wont need your crazy mom to help you buy vodka  uh great thanks for the tip  now when i bring my mom home is there anything i need to know about taking care of her  i suppose your biggest worry isnt the booze  youre 15 basically no mom  if child welfare let kids get away with that they wouldnt need those nice foster homes  and that would make them sad  theyd put her someplace too  my life is working  not the word id use  most 15yearold kids are doing what theyre supposed to be doing  you know theyre huffing glue catching crabs  if you turn me in ill sue you  thats privileged information  oh relax its not even your xray  shes awfully calm  house wrote new orders  theres a little bit of scarring not much  not enough to its cirrhosis  oh but she doesnt drink  congratulations you win  actually  no one wins  tumor cystic   solid mass  cancer  the vitamin kcaused the d vt and aggravated the liver  but the tumors the real reason for the bleed  the tumors the problem  mrs palmero im dr wilson  im afraid i have some bad news from your ultrasound  you have cancer    its big  we do nothing she dies from liver failure within 60 days   she needs a transplant  thats gonna happen   shes 38 years old shes a mother  shes a schizophrenic mother with no money on the public dole in fact  who knocks back vodka every time a breeze blows her way  mickey mantle had a whole bar named after him he got a transplant  yeah well lucy cant switchhit  plan b surgery to resect the tumor  joe bergin does the gamma knife thing laser cauterizes while it cuts saves more liver  the tumors way too big he wont even consider it  not a big risktaker bergin wont even drink milk on its expiration date  he has no discretion the surgical guidelines  would he do it at 46  why dont we just say its zero then we dont need him at all tumors grow they dont shrink  this one does  ninetyfive percent ethanol  the ethanol dehydrates the tumor cells  literally sucks them dry  it shrinks the tumor temporarily  how temporarily  well if were lucky  just long enough to fool the surgeon   dr shopius report to psych exam  dr shopius psych exam  good morning dr house  good morning dr cuddy  love that outfit  it says  im professional but im still a woman  actually it sort of yells the second part  yeah and your big cane is real subtle too  gotta go those running noses arent just gonna start walking on their own  the clinic can wait  how long maybe we could catch a movie  you should know by now my doctors have no secrets from me  i dont believe it  who came running to mommy  it doesnt matter who the point is i know exactly what you did  you have no idea what im talking about  somebody knows about a bad thing you did thats a big field  but somebody you think mightve told me that narrows it down quite a bit  someone who views me as a maternal authority figure  ayoung person perhaps how am i doing think im gonna get there  presumably hospital business how many patients its cameron  she found out about my birthday  i thought she told you and id have to stand here and smile while you gave me a sweatshirt or a fruit basket  you know made me feel that deep sense of belonging  actually i was just gonna remind you you owe me six clinic hours this week  oops  hi this is dr cuddy  i need all the charts on dr houses current patients    ive tried everything mmhmm  pulling the tongue ice packs on the throat hitting yourself  the groin pinch  well youve certainly covered all the normal medical bases  uh how are you hitting yourself though  is it with an open hand or a fist open hand  uhhuh well thats thats how they teach it at harvard med  how hard though  im sorry i missed that could you do that again  uh  thatsthats very good   its hiccups  i need to speak with you now mmhmm  i need to go peepee  dial it up a notch and repeat ill be back  ooh girl in the boys bathroom  very dramatic  it must be very important what she has to say to me  yesterday your patients tumor was 58 centimeters  today its 46 how does that happen  well at a guess id say  that dr house must be really really good  why am i wasting him on hiccups  i wash before and after  you also requisitioned  what patient was that for or are you planning a party  do me a favor  i was gonna say leave but that works   you shrunk the tumor  only way to get the guy to do the surgery  fraud was the only way   there is a reason that we have these guidelines  i know to save lives specifically doctors lives  and not just their lives but their lifestyles  wouldnt want to operate on anyone really sick they might die and spoil our stats  bergin has a right to know what he is operating on true  i got all focused on her right to live and forgot you do what you think is right  you really didnt know  no i didnt  and frankly im angry  which im guessing is the correct response   of course ill know better once you tell me what youre talking about  your birthday  oh  anger was a bad guess  well normally id put on a festive hat and celebrate the fact that the earth has circled the sun one more time  i really didnt think it was gonna make it this year  but darn it if it wasnt the little planet that could all over again  its a birthday its an excuse to be happy  you think thats lame  why are you here did you buy me a pony  im just waiting for the surgery  yeah well go scrub in  all right were done close her up  the tumor didnt just walk itself into a bar and order up a double shot of ethanol  someone shrunk it down  im sorry it was very very wrong  house is lucky i didnt just close her up  he tries it again thats what happens  ill pass it on   it looks like the surgeon got it all  but shes gonna have to have some chemotherapy   what kind is it    luke stop writing  if you stop for a second its not all gonna fall apart  give yourself a break once in a while  the fact is your moms gonna have an extra drink every now and then  no no she wont she doesnt  fine  there are some things you just cant fix thats all im saying  thats how youd handle it something like this youd just give up  no  id do it just like you  its an infusion shes gonna have a drain in her abdomen  youre going to have to check for possible infection   lucas palmero  trina wyatt child services state of newjersey  can i help you this is a private room  hes only 15 years old a minor  hes in a tough living situation  were just here to help  i dont need your help fifteen  lucas youre gonna have to come with us right now  where are you taking him  until the determination is made hell be housed at childrens services  i dont want to be housed i live with my mom  not for the next few days  come on lets not make this difficult huh  mom  mom  i love you  when the mets lost you remember  yeah  i remember  i love you      cuddy didnt say anything about pushing bergin to finish the surgery not a word  some kind of mind game shes waiting for me to crack  well either that or shes just being nice yeah right  you said you wouldnt call youre a real bastard you know  yeah i get that a lot  i dont think moms crazy  for in the old days though she had young mens praise and old mens blame  among the poor both old and young gave her praise  you called social services  it was you  n no no  its okay its okay i get it  hell have an easier time dealing with the system  sure he wont be with his real mother but his real mothers sick  someone needs to take care of him  im not gonna live here  what would his future have been taking you to chemo and back on the bus  and even if the cancers in complete remission  hell still have a mother who hears voices  talk no more  talk no more  look what i do to him limpy  you said that  i checked the phone records  only one call from this room  smart because they charge you two bucks a call  it was to social services the state of newjersey    youre his mother you couldnt do it to him anymore  good for you  schizophrenics can make rational decisions  on the small stuff yeah when to sleep what to drink you know  no lemonade but ill take some hemlock if youve got it  huh your man socrates  but giving up your son because its better for him its so sane its so rational  selfsacrifice is not a symptom of schizophrenia  it excludes the diagnosis  shes not schizophrenic look shes 36 years old when she first presents  its a little late but within the parameters  the internist sends her to a shrink one shrink sends her to the next  she tells them all shes not crazy the drugs dont work and why would they if shes not a head case  she got clearer when i took her off the psych meds  you think im crazy well yeah but thats not the problem  didnt we just leave your office i like to walk        is that dr jeffrey walters hi  my name is greg house im a doctor  oh is that the time imyeah im sorry my watch must have stopped  uh listen you treated a patient about 18 months ago a woman named lucille palmero  i wondered if you recalled running any tests  at all   oh how terribly foolish of me doctor is it that late  yes im calling from london you see must have got my times mixed up  i have a headache its my only symptom  i go to see three doctors the neurologist tells me its an aneurysm  the immunologist says ive got hay fever  the intensivist cant be bothered  sends me to a shrink who tells me that im punishing myself cause i want to sleep with my mommy   maybe youre just not getting enough sleep  pick your specialist you pick your disease  if its not schizophrenia what else presents with psych symptoms   porphyria  the madness of king george  what about that copper thing whats it called its genetic  the body accumulates too much copper  oh um uh wilsons disease   yeah very rare  nice i like it   if any of us did this youd fire us  well thats funny  i thought i encouraged you to question youre not questioning  youre hoping you want it to be wilsons  boom give her a couple of drugs shes okay  july 17 an appointment with a dr karn  she didnt keep it she never kept another appointment with a shrink he made after that  karn is not a shrink i looked him up hes an ophthalmologist  now why would she want her eyes checked  wilsons presents with cataracts i think yes it does  it also causes slight cirrhosis which dr chase so eagerly attributed to alcohol  so what are we still doing here  lucy  i dont think youre crazy   neither do i  but im crazy come on lean over here  come on   thats it  put your hands on the bar here and your chin in here  thank you  youre gonna see a bright light okay  your body might be accumulating too much copper  if it is this should help us see something called keyserfleischer rings  coppercolored circles around your corneas  wow  i guess we should start treating her for wilsons  thats what id do     i will talk no more ofbooks or the long war  but walk by the dry thorn until i have found some beggar sheltering from the wind  and there manage the talk until her name come round  if there be rags enough he will know her name and be well pleased remembering it   for in the old days though she had young mens praise and old mens blame  among the poor both old and young gave her praise    hi mrs palmero ready to go home  almost  mom    how are you  im good  oh   oh  oh you really need a haircut      dr house  luke were making dr house wait  thats okay were just here for the music  luke come on  im being discharged i heard a rumor  thank god i had cancer huh   its terrible having everybody think youre nuts  really   i called to thank you did you get my message  yes  youre welcome  im never thanking you you turned me in  i told you we were doing okay it was none of your business  look i dont care how you were living  i just wanted you out of my life  thats why i had dr cuddy call social services    you okay  you were right  it wasnt the dvt it was the schizophrenia i know  shes not nearly as interesting anymore  isnt it your birthday around now  thats some bad hat harry
