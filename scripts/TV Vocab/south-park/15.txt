our homes for fear of our childrens safety  uh where are our children  officer barbrady lets pretend for one second that we had a competent  law enforcer in this town what would he do  hmm thats a good question mayor let me get right on that with thinking   mayor mayor  eh the press is here  my name is sid greenfield  im the director from los angeles for americas most wanted   you certainly made it up here quickly  were desperate for stories   and and this one is so compelling  really  sure this story has everything people furniture talking  its a real american story  hey i thought of something uh no wait thats subtraction  mr directorperson what exactly do you want to do  mayor shouldnt we be focusing  we just want to do a recreation of the story for our show  then well flash a number on the screen that people can call if  they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter  thats it you win we win america wins  are you sure this wouldnt make our little town look dangerous  dont worry mayor americas most wanted is not about violence   its about family  it is  well in that case i guess its ok  great well get started with auditions immediately what part should we cast first  who will the director cast first  will it be mr garrison officer barbrady chef  i want to have an abortion  well we can do that this must be a very difficult time for you mrs  cartman yes its such a hard decision  but i just dont feel that i can raise a child in this screwy world  yes ms cartman if you dont feel fit to raise a child an abortion probably is the answer  do you know the actual time of conception  about eight years ago   i see so the fetus is  eight years old  ms cartman uh eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion  really  yes this is what we would refer to as the fortieth trimester  but i just dont think im a fit mother  but but we prefer to abort babies a little earlier on  in fact theres a law against abortions after the second trimester  well i think you need to keep your laws off of my body  hmm im afraid i cant help you ms cartman  if you want to change the law youll have to speak with your congressman  well thats exactly what i intend to do good day   come on children we gotta find a doctor  uh i cant do it dude   come on stan hospitals arent all that bad  yeh stop being a wuss   one moment please  nurse i need 20 ccs of sodium pentathol stat   whoa dude she doesnt have any arms  were an equal opportunity employer here son  doctor weve got a shot cracker outside  ill be right with you right after i

congressman oreilly  thats why i think abortion laws should be changed  well all i know is that third trimester abortions are illegal  i dont really know anything about fortieth  but the person at unplanned parenthood said  you were who i had talk to about changing the law  no no i think youve got to talk to the governor about that stuff  oh dear  well this is about all i can do for him  cant

these people in here are completely fucked  metaphorically speaking that is  what about mephesto are you taking care of him  hes on full life support and breathing fine  he shouldnt need any help so long as the power doesnt go out  hoof who didnt see that coming a mile away huh  tonight on americas most wanted  a shooters on the loose in colorado and the residents are up in arms  heres your host john walsh  good evening and welcome to americas most wanted  tonight terror invaded the small mountain community of south park colorado  when dr alfonse mephesto was gunned down in his laboratory  americas most wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime  in hopes that your calls can help solve the case  ive been shot   my god mr hat get some help  right away mr garrison  no no my lifetime partner and friend gone taken away in the wink of an eye   oh fortune how you mock me  what the eric roberts is improving lines again  im going to get the man to hospital who will help me  this is not a world i want to live in it is an angry   what the hell is this  weve lost the feed to la  uh we we seemed to have lost our linkup to the south park crew  so i guess well be going to our feature movie who framed roger rabbit  who framed roger rabbit  was it jimbo mr garrison chef  somebody go see why we lost the hookup  holy smokes that blizzard is getting crazy  dont panic anybody  the power lines are down but the backup generator is running just fine   nurse i could use some help in here  coming  lady is mephesto going to be ok  yes for now but im afraid the generator wont run for long  the batteries run out in halfanhour time is very short  nurse please i need another pair of hands in here  oh sorry  dont you see governor i should have a right to have an abortion if i want one  mra i dont know i i might need some more convincing  i mean what right do i have bringing another child into this overpopulated world  then again i should have thought of that before having sex  then again oh i just dont know  please mr chef i have over a hundred people to attend to here   and only myself and nurse goodly  what do you want me to do   do you know anything about surgery  i used to watch quincy  what why the hell didnt you say so put on some scrubs  boys im making you all honorary doctors you can help us save these peoples lives  no way dude  well were not going anywhere for a long time   were snowed in  yes were trapped  like sailors on a submarine  my god this is the worst storm ive ever seen  oh i have to get out of here i havent eaten since breakfast  yeh im getting hungry too  i hope you all realize what we might be facing here  our only option may be to eat each other to stay alive  uh its only been like four hours  arent you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly  thats the law of the land mr director  i dont eat pretty but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive so be it   but how do we decide who  well we draw straws  now wait a minute we all had a big breakfast  cant you people go without eating for a little while  calm down soldier we need every person here to keep his head  barbrady fetch some straws  well who the hell made you the boss anyway  who the hell made jimbo boss  was it barbrady chef mr ga  this mans appendix has burst i have no choice but to operate now with our limited power  i need you all to be strong for me nurse goodly will take care of the anesthesia  chef you act as her arms boys you have to help with suction and bandages ready   no  ok first ill make an incision on the chest over the heart  oh boy   dude you barfed into the incision  sweet  suction  hey whos screwing with the lights  who is screwing with the lights  is it barbrady or jimbo or the 1991 denver broncos  that is really starting to piss me off  all right so far everybody has a long piece of straw  well keep drawing  wait a minute where the hell is the short one   the short what  damn it barbrady  when you draw straws youre supposed to have one of them short   thats how you decide who loses  thats not how i played it  uhh could we hurry this up my stomach is growling  i found a map that shows the location of a backup generator  apparently they built a large selfsustaining generator  for just this kind of emergency  but its out and away from the hospital  so how do we get to it  we must split up into two teams team a and team b  team a will consist of myself stan kyle eric chef and nurse goodly  team b will consist of kenny  now listen closely team b your goal will be to turn on the backup generator  to do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct  meanwhile team a will go to the holding area  here where this is a television and some cocoa  we will drink the cocoa and watch family programming  until team b makes it through the sewage duct  by that time team b remember thats you kenny  should reach the outer core of the generator  it will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top and there could be velociraptors here  once you reach the top you should be able to get a clear view through this window  of us drinking cocoa and watching television  then you can proceed down into the generator and power it on  are there any questions   no that sounds pretty sweet to me  right then lets do it go team  uh cant go on  so hungry  were all going to die in this horrible place  we have to have the energy to make it through the night we have to eat  how can we how could we live with ourselves  theres only one answer eat eric roberts  yes of of course nobody gives a shit about eric roberts  eat eric roberts  no no please  well theres no going back now were cannibals  god save us  god wants you to live mayor fight  well i have to admit eric roberts was much juicier than i expected  this snow just isnt letting up were gonna die here i know it   what time is it barbrady  its almost midnight  uh i cant go on  well give the storm another hour after that we might have to eat again  what christ are you people diabetic or something  team b come in team b   this is team b  listen team b  we found another path to the generator  theres actually a nice heated walkway to it  so you dont need to walk through all that sewage  are you fucking kidding me making me crawl through that fucking thing  oh well forget i said that then listen team b  you should be seeing a large drift of snow  with some metal sticking out of it just to your left  yep i see it team a  good head towards it team a out  what if mephesto never wakes up and i never find out who my father is  my god what a harrowing tale of human drama this is  ll of us doing what we must to survive  it is amazing what people can do under stress just look at the pyramids  nobody knows how they built those or who  who built the pyramids  was it the babylonians officer barbrady samaritans  team a this is team b  roger team b  hes reached the backup generator team b can you see the two copper nodes  roger  good now is there a wire connecting them  uh uh  damn the wire connecting the nodes is gone  we need to complete the circuit or were screwed   do you have any wire here  theres no time  once these lights flicker out all the patients on life support are going to die  wait a second guys  no kenny you cant there must be some other way  hes going to make the connection himself with his hands   no hell die  go kenny  kenny noooo   oh my god theyve killed kenny  you bastards   the power   quickly get the scanner running again  weve got a chance now  well ok mrs cartman ill legalize fortieth trimester abortions for you  oh thank you thank you  well have the pregnancy terminated immediately   terminated   well yes thats what an abortion is  oh no i i didnt mean that  i meant the other thing you can do whats that other a word   adoption   yes thats what i mean adoption  well thats pretty different  i should just tell my son the truth about everything myself  good day mr president  well we made it the power is on the snow is melting  and your friend mephesto is doing fine  where where am i  youre at the hospital mr mephesto you were shot  now we dont know who tried to shoot you but  oh im sure it was my brother again he tries to shoot me every month  wheres the little fat boy hell be delighted that mephesto is awake  he went off looking for mr kenny  he was a good friend and ill miss him  he was very brave he risked his life so that mephesto could live  yeh and now hes a freezy pop  dude do you think if we hit him with a shovel hed shatter  i dont know lets find out  oh its over were free  yes but at what cost mr garrison at what cost  listen everybody we did what we had to in there  but how will be live with ourselves now  mmmone day at a time mayor mmone day at a time  well im bringing home some eric roberts in a doggy bag  does anybody else want some  im glad you could all come i can finally reveal who the father of eric cartman is  but first i want to thank kenny mccormick for sacrificing his life   just tell us already  all right all right  the father of eric cartman is  say did anybody see that terrance and phillip special last month  wasnt that just the funniest thing  damn it tell me who my father is  sorry as i said before the father is somebody in this room  the father is  mrs cartman   what  yes its true  no that doesnt make sense  yes it took quite a while for me to understand as well  you see mrs cartman is a hermaphrodite  meaning what  meaning she has both male and female genitals  its true  you mean at the drunken barn dance  when we all got together with her she was a he  no no not exactly but she did have a penis  the fact of the matter is hermaphrodites cannot bear children  so ms cartmans dna match with eric can only meant that she is his father  and she got another woman pregnant at the drunken barn dance  eh man this is fucking weak  dude youre a big fat ass and your mom is a hermapholite  im sorry i never told you eric  i just thought maybe it would be a little shocking to you  oh well geewhiz you think so mom  well thats that thank you all for playing  no no wait a minute if if shes my dad then whos my mom  who is eric cartmans mother  is it mrs crabtree sheila broslofski the mayor  ahh forget it
