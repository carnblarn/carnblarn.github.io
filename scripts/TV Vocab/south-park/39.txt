commit mass suicide  when the meteor shower starts  are you sure  of course were sure were the beaureau of alcohol tobacco  and fire arms its our job to know what these fanatics do  so what does the atf do when religious fanatics are going to commit mass suicide  uh dont worry we wont let that happen  even if it means we have to kill each and everyone of them  whats the situation  apparently weve got at least five dozen men and women  in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts  any luck talking to somebody in the house  weve tried calling but theres no answer i think

suicide when the meteor shower starts   woah cool  i wanna be a reporter someday  just moments ago a couple emerged from the house  according to the atf the couple refused to cooperate  then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone  the atf had no choice but to shoot the insane couple  and now a stand off has insued  oh that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits  the atf commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be  children inside and that they  wait a minute  are the primary concern of all  oh my god dude thats this house they think our parents are the religious cult  do you think someday i could be a reporter  weve just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house  howing evedence that there are indeed inocent children trapped inside  those sick cult fanatic bastards  dude  hey our parents arent religious fantastics  why we godda tell them that theyre makin an awful mistake dont we  yes come on angles looks like we
