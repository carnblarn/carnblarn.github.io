that you didnt molest him because of some  flaw in his looks or personality  i didnt do it because its wrong  i know  but im afraid this problem has run very deep through mr garrisons mental state  i

each other out dont we fellas   yeah  yeah thats right  alright its just that i mean were all family men here right   sure  sure are  well can i ask you guys a difficult question   dabsoulutly  of course  alright  would you have sex with your son to save his life  this is one of them scruples questions aint it  no no i got a better one  would you have sex with your mother to save your fathers life  oh like if someone had a gun to your fathers head and said  have sex with your mother or else ill shoot im   yeah  thats a tough one  no no wait uh you dont understand  how bout if someone made you have sex with your mother and father  to save your own life  no no no way  but if it was to save my mothers life i think i would have to have sex with my father   me too  well i think that goes without saying  well actually im just talking about a son  well personally i would have sex with my son to save my mothers life  it depends on how big a gun are we talking here   uh he doesnt have a gun  the father doesnt have a gun  no nobodys got a gun  i think if someone said have sex with your mother or else im gonna kill your son  but he didnt have a gun i wouldnt do it   he could have a knife though  yeah right  sure right  if a killer put a knife to my throat and said  have sex with your father or else im gonna kill your mother  while havin sex with you  i would have sex with myself  yeah i would that makes sense whatre you talking about   how do we write the note cartman  left e flat   lets see i think it looks like this  alright  now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music  and change it to the tone cartman played  cmon  there  that should do it  sweet i cant wait to see em crap their pants in front of everybody yguys  okay lets get back to the room  whats
