britches by our artist alanis morissette   huh  its the same goddamned song  now look im tryin to be cool about this  but you just cant rip peoples music off its against the law  i am above the law  mr chef im afraid you leave me no alternative were going to sue you  sue me you stole one of my songs and you are going to sue me  yes i suggest you get a real good lawyer well have the best in the

let me do all the talking chef were going to bring these bastards down  right  this court is now in session who is representing the defense  i am your honor gerald broflovski   and representing the prosecution  i am your honor johnny cochran   uh oh  why oh oh  chef thats johnny cochran huh hes the one that got oj off  oh oh  i need some help over here please help i think hes got thirddegree burns  give the child to me  is he goin to be all right doctor  is he goin to live  its a stick  damn it dont give me that medical jargon just tell me straight  is he goin to be okay  and so on this fifteenth day of what is considered to be the most important  trial of theday johnny cochran has appeared to defend capitalist records  the question now is will cochran use his famous chewbacca defense   whats a chewbacca defense  i dont know  thats what cochran used in the oj simpson trial  goddamned i hate that cochran guy if he was here in front of me id be like  ay you stupid son of a bitch you d i b ima im gonna kick you in the nuts  im sure that would scare the hell out of him cartman  and so in summation ladies and gentlemen of the jury youve heard  the version of my clients song recorded over twenty years ago  youve heard the exact same song produced by these cheats in the past month  id say its pretty much an openandshut case make the right decision thank you  ive got em  mr johnny cochran your closing arguments  ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury chefs attorney would certainly want you  to believe that his client wrote stinky britches ten years ago  and they make a good case hell i almost felt pity myself  but ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury  i have one final thing i want you to consider  ladies and gentleman this is chew bacca  chewbacca is a wookie from the planet kashyyyk  but chewbacca lives on the planet endor  now think about that that does not make sense   damn it  what  hes using the chewbacca defense  why would a wookie an eightfoot tall wookie want to live on endor  with a bunch of twofoot tall ewoks that does not make sense  but more important you have to ask yourself what does this have to do with this case  nothing  ladies and gentlemen it has nothing to do with this case it does not make sense  look at me im a lawyer defending a major record company  and im talkin about chewbacca does that make sense  ladies and gentlemen i am not making any sense none of this makes sense  and so you have to remember when youre in that jury room deliberatin and  conjugatin the emancipation proclamation does it make sense no  ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury it does not make sense  if chewbacca lives on endor you must acquit the defense rests  ohkay then  wow hes good  in a tearyeyed courtroom johnny cochran has just finished his closing arguments  and as was anticipated he did use the chewbacca defense  whether or not it worked is up to the jury to decide  how find you the jury  we find the defendant jerome
