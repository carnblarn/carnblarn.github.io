contest  yes i am ive got the costume its waiting in the house  yesterday i got this huge package in the mail and it was big okay  hold on kids  mrs broflovski  were from mt peaceful cemetery could we have a word with you  eehh sure come in  what is it  ms broflovski somebody has defiled your mothers grave  defiled how  well im afraid that somebody dug her up  dug her up why  well the most likely reason is that  somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body  we dont want to upset you but it happens  somebodys probably making love to her corpse as we speak  every vile position every disrespectful act imaginable  hoh dear god  yes by now hes probably even removed her eyes  and made love to the empty sockets as well  no we dont want to upset you but you should know  that your mothers body would be stiff and dry  so he would have to have it soaked in warm water  for several hours before making love to it   yes and now for the difficult part  brace yourself  it is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh  leaving her to look something like an over loved hunk of swiss cheese she probably  okay okay i get the point just tell me what youre gonna do about it   do  oh we dont do anything were just the watchmen  yeah i guess maybe you might wanna call the police or something  now he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place  so as not to allow further decomposition  package delivery for mrs cartman  a package oh really  well i think i can sign for that  sign heah and heah and heah  i got a christmas present i got a christmas present  maybe i can see what it is ill just open one little corner  thats good ill rewrap it later  oh sweet lifesized blowup antonio banderas love doll  with realistic genitalia  oh

docks for the halloween haunt  but first we just need to inform you about thee people or persons out there  digging up bodies to have sex with them gentlemen  good afternoon ladies and gentlemen  a person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac  so that you all know what to expect my partner alan has draw a sketch  of what having sex with a dead body might look like  yes we know its horrible its probably best you not look at it  now alan will demostrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like  excuse me how is this helping  thats it folks now we can all go to the docks and enjoy the halloween haunt  noo dont go to the docks  im captain bly  you landlubbers had better stay away from the docks  or else therell be hell to pay  fire the cannon  we wont warn ya again stay away from our docks  i warned you i told you this would happen  when you allow bands like korn to come to town  and play your hedonistic hallowen concerts this is what you get  great rehearsal gang that was really groovy  lets practice one more time before the show starts  guys im sorry but the halloween haunts been cancelled  cancelled  you best clear out of here theres pirate ghosts and theyll kill you  well gang it looks like we have to pack it up  goddamnit now what the hell are we gonna do  oh hey the kids from last night  wow is that the antonio banderas lifesized blowup doll  hey kenny  say whats the matter you kids look kind of glum   somebody took my dead grandma  what  we dug her up cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders  but then something took her body away  now shes doomed to walk the earth in limbo  aw i hate to see little clowns cry  well that does it somethin funny is going on here  your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts  theyre not pirate ghosts jonathan theyre ghost pirates  pirate ghost would suggest that a pirate died and became a ghost  but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate  no david then they are pirate ghosts because theyre the ghosts of pirates  youre wrong because there were no pirates in colorado  so these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact   but that makes them pirate ghosts  no it makes them ghost pirates  guys guys guys fighting isnt gonna solve anything  dont you see this is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do  pirate ghosts  then youll help us  sure well help you if theres one thing we like more than playing music  its solvin a groovy mystery  alright  is everybody okay  people stealing bodies to have sex with them pirate ghosts destroying the town  when did everything go so wrong  i hate to say it but i think priest maxi was right this is what we get  for celebrating halloween and allowing that band korn to come play  hes right nothin ever went wrong in this town before that evil korn band showed up  well i say we go find them and kick their devilworshipping butts out of town  lynch mob  so this is where you last saw your dead grandma  right maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside  alright gang we have to split up and look for clues  how should we split up  i know lets have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life  which they can overcome go this way  and everyone whose insecurities sabotage  their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way  okay  wow that was easy  heres their van heres their van   lets flip it over  okay people lets try to stay orderly  the best way to do this is all get on one side and push it from the top  devil woshippers  come on they gotta be around here somewhere  this place gives me the creeps  say this looks like a clue  pirate lore of south park  now why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates  whoa what was that  the noise came from in here stay close everybody  oh no i lost my glasses  what does this dead grandma look like  uh she was all like crunchy and crispy and stuff  hey i got an idea we should set a groovy trap  good idea  how do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts  we need something that might catch their eye to use as bait i know  your antonio banderas love doll  oh no this is my christmas present  if anything happens to it my mom will know i opened it early  come on kid we all have to do our part even antonio  my glasses gotta be around here somewhere  is that you jonathan boy im glad to see you i lost my glasses  hey you got a cold jonathan  yeah that sounds like a groovy song man remember that one  fieldy what are you doing  oh i was talking to you jonathan  hey wait a minute  if youre over there then how could you be over here unless youre actually a  puhpuuhh pirate ghost  okay heres how the trap will work  when the pirate ghosts walk in they should go right for antonio banderas  when they hit the superslippery floor theyll slide onto this mining cart  which should travel down this path into the next room  where the fish net will fall on them  wow cool  hey somebodys coming  weve got to hide  hey theres antonio banderas hell help us  jonathan no  hold on guys  lright korn time for you to get out of town  korn is sending their demon minions upon us  alright gang looks like were gonna have to use our special korn powers  korn powers vitalize  form of corn  alright great job gang   that didnt help at all  we know its just cool to do  nibblet  what the hell is that thing  you did it nibblet you trapped them  yeah and now lets see who these pirate ghosts really are  oh i guess they really were pirate ghosts  alright korn you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me  hehey look what nibblet sees   what the  fr maxi  well what are you waiting for barbrady arrest that band  no arrest him  i think ive got this groovy mystery solved  well i must say i still dont get this at all  its simple priest maxi didnt want there to be a halloween  so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks  yeah and then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts  then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese  and all he had to do then was create a ghost ship  by using some candles a mirror and two squirrels  father why did you go to all this trouble  because halloween is an abomination of god  i would do anything to stop this wretched unholy holiday  including killing people and wreaking havoc all over south park  dont you see that by trying to stop halloween  youve scared the hell out of everybody  no  okay buddy you can explain downtown  well this is all fine and good  but it doesnt explain what happened to my mothers body  yeah wheres grandma  there she is  well thanks a lot korn you korn powers really came through for us  yes we were wrong about you will you please play for our halloween party  well sure why the heck not  all right  oh no the pirate ghosts are back  nibblet  well this sure has been a wacky night  but me and the gang learned a lot and we hope you did too  you all perceived us to be mean evil people  but really were just normal guys and we all  perceived pirate ghosts to be real when actually they were just cotton swabs  so i guess the lesson is  its easy to perceive somethin someway and then be wrong  so we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive  the gang and i wrote a song about it and it goes goes a little somethin like this  and aone andatwo and a  sweet  antonio no  you son of a bitch chicken from outer space thing come back here  and the winner of the costume contest is  wendy for her chewbacca costume  come on up wendy
