dreamcast  how  look the tooth fairy is all made up right  all made up not real nothings real  so all we have to do  is go to a really rich kids house  put our tooth under his pillow  wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money  then sneak back in and take it  woohoo  the kidll never even know  oh dude that istits  that is big fat oprah tits right there  oh my god what if im not

size of these houses  told you dude  cherry creek is the richest part of denver  ill bet these kids get 10 bucks a tooth  from the tooth fairy  hey that house looks perfect  theres obviously kids living there  here you can tell this is the kidss window  cuz its gotmegaman stickers on it  cartmanonce youre in the kids room  leave the tooth under the pillow then come back out  well wait for the parents to see it and leave money  then swing you back in to grab it  got it  this is the smartest business venture ever  what the  hey what the hell are you guys doing  were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kids pillow  then come back and take the tooth fairy money  that his parents leave him  hey you cant do that  why not  because thats what were going to do  yeah you ripped off our idea  what the hell are you talking about  weve been doing this for over 2 years   nice tooth fairy costume  you think anybodyd believe you in that  its better than your dress  you look like a bad jennifer lopez nightmare  how dare you  look this is our turf  you better scram before the boss breaks your legs  you scram we were here first  whats going on  oh its the tooth fairies  oh nice going now you woke him up  youwoke him up  i dont have any loose teeth miss fairies  but i have been a very good boy  shut up shut up shut up  alright that does it  cmon were going to see the boss  whos the boss  loogie  my associates here tell me you were working cherry creek tonight  is that true  uh yeah  right on our turf boss  i aint never seen that kinda disre  we were there first  kids been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years  i do it just like my big brother before me  and my oldest brother before that  damn it and we thought we were so original  let me ask you something  you were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kids pillow  then what  what do you mean  how were the kids parents going to know  there was a tooth under their childs pillow  ha you guys dont even know  how the tooth trade works  whats the tooth trade  look any shmuck can sneak through a window  wearing a pretty dress  the tooth racket is much more involved  we keep careful track of what houses weve hit  so we dont hit the same ones twice in less than 2 months  we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow  but leave a note for mom and dad to see  this is how we let the parents know  to leave money under the pillow  once the notes have been placed in the last house  we start all over going back to the first house  but this time all we have to do is collect money  and the kids never know what hit em  wow wow wow  the hardest part is getting teeth  weve tried various places  cemetaries  hockey games  anywhere we can find them  no  the teeth we do manage to acquire  are then sorted according to size color and quality  but theres never enough teeth  never enough  amazing  man that is tits  and now my only problem is  what do i do with you  raarr  tell you what how would you like to  run the south park tooth racket for me  oh i dont know  its that or i can cut off you penises  hmmm work for you or have my penis cut off  work for you or have my  cartman  how much do we get if we work for you  ill cut you in at 2  penis cut off  were in  fellow dentists as you all know  we are still having numerous reports  of missing teeth from all over the country  there are also reports of missing tooth fairy money  we believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this  a giant halfchicken halfsquirrel  that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep  in order to build some kind of a giant nest  for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring  we believe also  that this creature would have at least a mild understanding  of algebra  uh excuse me i think i have a more logical theory  well by all means mr foley enlighten us  i think what weve got here is a black market tooth racket  something where one group is stealing the money and teeth  from another group for a profit  ha ha ha ha ha ha  ha ha ha ha ha ha  oh mr foley you realize how ridiculous that sounds  its not ridiculous its very possible  ive seen it happen before  where  in montreal  ha ha ha ha ha ha  ha ha ha ha ha ha  and where pray is this montreeal  look i know how to handle this  all we have to do is bring down the kingpin  and the rest will fall  youll see ill have it taken care of in a matter of weeks  very well mr foley you go on your wild goose chase  and meanwhile well deal with therealproblems at hand  i will  anyway the halfchicken halfsquirrel  would
