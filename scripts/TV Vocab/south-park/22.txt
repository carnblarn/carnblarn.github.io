im afraid my buddy kyle was right  theres not enough room in south park to accomodate a festival  mr poo if you wouldnt mind we cant hear our chairman  if you could just turn yourself down  youre at about 7 right now we need you at about 3 ok  uh folks please  little towns like this simply arent meant for big advance  we love having visitors but golly  too many of you is hurtin our ecosystem  besides folks film festivals shouldnt be about  what celebrities are comin  or what film is gonna get shown  it should be about people gettin together  and watching movies and about people who can never get their  movies seen get a chance to have it watched  if only once  a good film festival should be something where we all say  oh lets forget about lawyers and exits and studios  and celebrities  lets forget all those things for just a while  and just watch some new art   i have had enough of you  now as i was saying this shall usher in a whole new decade of films  oh ohoh hes dead mr hankeys dead  well this worked once before  thanks chef your big chocolate balls are just the trick   what the hell is he doing  i dont know  oh my god  it smells it smells  ahh hurry up its coming  im trying damn it  lets get out of this town  golly i guess i dont know my own strength  you did it mr hankey you got rid of all the film people  oh yeah now all we have is a town covered in shit this is much better  i couldnt have done it without you kyle kisses  stan im sorry i dragged you to all those independent films  well thats ok wendy i fogive you  sometimes i forget that even though a few independent films are great  most of them suck ass  yes and ive learned something too  being a sell out is sweet cause you make a lot of money  and when you have money  you dont have to hang out with any poorass loosers like you guys  screw you guys im going home
