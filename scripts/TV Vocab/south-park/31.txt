with it   i think im gonna name it gorak  no dude we have to name it steve  steve what the hell kind of caveman name is steve  its my name and i found him   you didnt find him i found him  what are you talking about dude  i fell down that abyss and there it was  you wouldnt have even noticed it if i hadnt pointed it out  kenny who found the ice man   yeah i think you ought to name him steve  i think were almost there you guys  alright people the next order of business is a very serious matter  we need to vote on whether south park should reinstate the death penalty or not   all those in favor say yippie  yippie  wait what was that i missed the question yippie   all those opposed say nay  nay   screw you  hey screw you  hi excuse me  not now kids the town is having a very important debate on capital punishment  but we found a frozen ice man from the past  i found this frozen guy in the woods today  no i found this frozen guy in the woods today   what the hell is going on here  we came for our reward   yeah like a kid with a wallet  reward what reward  mayor i think the boys may have stumbled on to something here  you see mayor frozen links are often found dinosaur eggs woolly mammoths  this specimen could be a missing link in our evolution if i could unfreeze the body  and perform an autopsy i could learn much about this creatures people and its time   sure sure sure be my guest knock your socks off  thank you mayor  oh and boys i cant give you a reward for finding this creature  but if youd like ill let you name him   really  sweet how bout steve   steve it is  wait a minute his name is gorak  come on steve weve got work to do  unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work  well have to use the most advanced methods available  this is very exciting he could be a neanderthal  or an australapithocus from the paleolithic era  do you see that kevin these clothes are from eddie bauer  i havent seen anybody wear clothes from eddie bauer since 1996  this is incredible think of all we can learn from this body all that it teach us  lets hope the press doesnt get wind of this right away  stand back people theres nothing to see here   what about the prehistoric ice man  oh yeah there is that  dr mephesto could you please tell us whats going on  ladies and gentlemen we still have a lot of work to do  but it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months  yes its true although at this early stage  we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes  fascinating news tonight from south park  an ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice  a team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body  so that it can be autopsied and studied  the caveman was discovered by kyle brovlofsky who had this to say  well i fell down this ice cavern and i saw this block of ice  the prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neopostjurassic era  where he was probably a part of a hunting and gathering  tribe that lived on waterston street  thats it kevin we can begin the autopsy  whats this   holy crap hes alive  thats impossible do an ekg on him   my god he really is alive the ice mustve preserved him  well quick do something  no no weve got to think this through  mayor this man has not been conscious for almost three years  he wont understand what he sees hell be frightened and confused  well you cant just let him die  perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time   oh my goodness it looks as if hes about to speak  where where am i   what  whats he saying  is that english   what youre hungry  where am i   youre hungry  whats going on  me friend friend me friend mephesto  mephesto  if we could understand what hes saying then maybe we could get some answers  if only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level  as primitive as his own a mind like a child   dude i wanted to call him gorak  goraks a gay name   no it isnt  why you being such a dick  im not being a dick youre being a dick  hello children dr mephesto needs one of you  to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man   ill go  no ill go i found him  damn ive never seen you guys fight like this  alright theres only one fair way to do this  everyone stick out their potatoes  my mother and your mother were out hanging clothes  my mother punched your mother in the nose what color blood came out  bloo uh o spells blue  and that means that you will go to the lab and help out mephesto  and then we could all go home and watch murphy brown   steve you  where am i  steve steve   oh good your here  oh my god they revived gorak  you bastards  yes and i need you to communicate with him  see if you can understand what hes saying   uh hi  hi   whatd he say  he said hi   very interesting  where am i  what   he wants to know where he is  tell him tell him hes home  youre home   in the year 1999  its 1999   hes been frozen for the past 32 months  dude youve been frozen for 32 months   and we found you  what 32 months  alright alright calm down i think thats enough for today  good job dude you freaked him out  shut up assmaster youre just jealous that they had me talk to him  guess what youre not my best friend anymore cartmans my new best friend  oh yeah well youre not my best friend anymore either  cartman in now my best friend  killer  fine   fine  fine   are you alphonse mephesto  the same  we understand that you are currently in  possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996   thats right  we would like to  we would like to offer our services in your experiments  where are you gents from  from the university of america  well theres not a lot to see but come on in  hes still not responding much to us the shock is still settling in  but weve made great progress now that hes in the habitat   habitat  yes kevin and i designed a habitat for steve to live  in that is completely like his own world everything is 1996 oriented  amazing he looks so much like us  yes well kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out how related to us  steve really is he came up with this drawing  dr mephesto we realize that scientific study is expensive   we wanna help you make this project more lucrative  how would we do that  its easy  as you can see the ice man is listening to ace of bass  which was a very popular group during his era  their primite drumming soothes peoples tempers   he doesnt look very happy in there  no he sure doesnt  i wasnt talking to you buttpipe i was talking to cartman  well i was talking to cartman too  oh im pretty friggen cool all of a sudden  here we see the ice man trying to gain internet access on the computer  the internet was not very big at his time so the web frightens and confuses him  its okay he cant hurt you its oneway glass  he cant even see us and now the ice man watches television  this grizzly bear has the strength of over ten morgan freemans   im really pissing him off right now  wait this could be dangerous   how so  hes changing the channel  something on the television could frighten and confuse him  and theyve done it the atlanta falcons are going to the superbowl  what   you guys arent being very nice to my creature  hes my creature  hes fine boys and were learning so much from him  let him out dude hes scared  he would be more scared on the outside you think this stuff freaks him out  how would you think hed react to whats happening in the government right now  but it isnt right  little boy sometimes whats right isnt as important as whats profitable  oh my god they killed kenny  what im not talking to you  gorak   gorak are you there  oh hi what are you doing here  viewing hours are 10 to 18  i dont think its fair
