now pay attention ahem  i heard there is no christmas in the silly middle east  no trees no snow no santa clause  they have different religious beliefs  they believe in muhahmad and not in our holiday  and so every december i go to the middle east and say  hey there mr muslim merry fuckin christmas  put down that book the koran and hear some holiday wishes  in case you havent noticed its jesuss birthday  so get off your heathen muslim ass and fuckin celebrate  there is no holiday season in india ive heard  they dont hang up their stockings and that is just absurd  theyve never read a christmas story they dont know what rudolph is about  and that is why in december ill go to india and shout  hey there mr hinduist merry fuckin christmas  drink egg nog and eat some beef and pass it to the mrs  in case you havent noticed its jesuss birthday  so get off your heathen hindu ass and fuckin celebrate  now i heard that in japan everyone just lives in sin  they pray to several gods and put needles in their skin  on december 25th all they do is eat a cake  and that is why i go to japan and walk around and say  hey there mr shintoist merry fuckin christmas  god is gonna kick your ass you infidelic pagan scum  in case you havent noticed theres festive things to do  so lets all rejoice for jesus merry fuckin christmas to you  on christmas day i travel round the world  taoists
