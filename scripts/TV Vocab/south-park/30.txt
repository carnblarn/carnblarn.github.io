you are  thank you mayor i dont want to sound like a dick hole but i  mayor these boys want that harbucks coffee shut down right now  well i cant just shut them down this is a free country   but theyre ruining our city  the best i can do is create a proposition  well call it prop ten  the town can vote on it and if it passes well see what we can do   hurray  what do you say boys were gonna pass a law   uh hurray  so i guess you wanna do some campaigning  you can do commercials and thing like that we can have a vote in the middle of town  and obviously if more than fifty percent of the people show up  and care enough to want harbucks out then theyre out so good luck to you   didnt you see them  alright whats next   next is issue thirtysevend missing underpants  is it cold in here  boys could i have a quick this and that with you  boys i dont know who wrote that report  but now that youve convinced everybody you better stick with it  because if these people find out that you didnt really write that paper  and i actually do get fired then mr hat is gonna do horrible things to you  oh not that mr hat thats real horrible  anyway good luck passing your new law boys  jesus man

on prop ten here to remind us why  are the loveable innocent children  since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers we went and asked  our friends the underpants gnomes and they told us all about big corporations  underpants gnomes  big corporations are good  whats this  good  because without big corporations we wouldnt have things  like cars and computers and canned soup  even harbucks coffee started off as a small little business  but because it made such great coffee and because they ran  their business so well they managed to grow and grow  until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today  and thats why we should all let harbucks stay  thats not what you said last time  well the truth is we didnt write that paper last time  you little turds youve ruined my life for the last time  these boys are absolutely right weve been using these poor kids to pull  at your heart strings for our cause and its wrong  were as low and despicable as rob reiner  you keep protesting and complaining  but did any of you even bother to taste harbucks coffee  harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best  dont you think you should at least try it  hey this is pretty damn good  ya it doesnt have that bland raw sewage taste that tweeks coffee has  hey hey that is good   its a french roast  its suttle and mild  mild like that first flash of sun on an april morning this is coffee the way it should be  hey no hard feelings tweek ya know  we still need some one to run this harbucks coffe house  im sure it will make a lot of money  thank you mr poston but i think well be fine  with the money we make selling our son into slavery  just kidding son  i love you guys
