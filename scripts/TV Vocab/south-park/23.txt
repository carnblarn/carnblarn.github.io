                 its a good thing we got her to the hospital in time  whats wrong with her  its chickenpox there seems to be a small epidemic going around  your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little girl i take it  no no shes been perfectly healthy  well thats the problem see chickenpox is pretty normal thing with young children  as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease   shelley looks whos come to visit you your little brother stan  oh whoopee  you know most people dont realize chickenpox is actually a form of herpes   dude you got herpes on your face  shut up brat   will my daughter be ok  shell be fine   stop it  we just want to be cautious and monitor her here  come on stanley give your sister a kiss and then we have to go  and then the doctor said that its much worse as you get older  my daughter is in pretty bad shape now  but if she were in her 20s she could die  my god i never knew the chickenpox was such a dangerous illness  i guess its much better to get it when youre young  so tell me if im crazy but i started thinking that we should intentionally  have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox  let them get it now while theyre young  thats not crazy at all sharon mothers do it all the time  ooh yes when i was a child my mother had me go over to a little girls house  who had the chickenpox just so i would get it  so

to turn in a paper too  homework but im in the hospital  well your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while youre sick  that son of a bitch what kind of sick weirdo is he  now stanley i know

heres a pencil and some paper  hey wherere you going   were going down to happy burger for some milkshakes  milkshakes   yeah and then were going to the movies  see ya son   weak  so this is how america works  we have gods and clods  my dad says america needs both rich and poor to survive but i have a better idea  no i dont understand it dr schwartz hes perfectly healthy   hes been over at kennys house 3 days in a row and still hasnt caught the chickenpox  what  i dont know what else to do we sent the other boys over and they all got sick  but i cant get my little kyle to catch it   oh my god  kyle what are you doing there honey   you  ill call you back drshwartz   you  what bubala what is it  you sent us over to kennys house on purpose you wanted us to get sick  oy it was for your own good kyle i wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young   why so i could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die like stan  now kyle come here   you get away from me you crazy woman  oh boy   beer  oh no thanks i brought my own  microbrew sampler from aspen has 6 different beers from local breweries  say remember the time we built the fort in your moms back yard   it took damned 2 years to finish it  what ever happened to that old hunk of junk   thats where i live now  o right   and so thats why nightrider was the best show in america  stan stan   wake her up and were both dead  sorry sorry  you know how after we spent the night at kennys house  you and cartman got sick with chickenpox   dude our parents sent us over there to get us sick  what are you talking about  they knew that staying at kennys house would make us sick   and they made us do it anyway  they did   yeah and i think i figured out why  why   because theyre a bunch of assholes  uh of course  come on dude we gotta get outta here  i dont know what theyre planning next but it cant be good  i hope that one day america can be more like endor  where the ewats live endor is very  mom asnwer that  they have crazed ewats and barbeques  which is why i like endor more than america  cartman you remember how we all spent the night at kennys a couple of days ago  i remember frozen waffles with no sidedishes  cartman our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from kenny  yeah dude your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face   she what  its some kind of parental conspiracy   our parents are trying to kill us or something  that bitch  im gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts  no no no no come on fatass were gonna get em all back  well im sure youll find another job soon something will come along  its not that easy you were lucky  now now i wasnt lucky  you had rich parents you got to go to that expensive community college  i worked my ass off to get to where i am today i wanted to be somebody  i wanted to be somebody to i just wasnt born with a silver enima up my ass  youre just jealous youre a bitter old drunk just like your father  now dont make me do that again  you son of a bitch   doctor  yes   wheres stan  stan   stan our son  oh yes wheres stan   you mean stanleys missing  no no hes not missing  we just cant seem to find him at this moment   oh my god our son ran away  will he be ok out of the hospital  oh sure sure but we have to get him back soon  if he doesnt get his antibiotic shot today he could die   die  yes die it wont be an easy death either   the chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs  ok well lets go look  as he chokes for breath the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain  making him think hes david duchove  ooh god no   im sure he couldnt have gone far  now moving on all fours and wheezing  uncontrollably his cellular structure will regress in a deluctnous mass of  so how was it did you boys have a good time fishing   that son of a bitch ripped my parka  catch anything  i just dont get it why would he invite me fishing and turn into a complete bastard  well darling i have to tell you something he didnt invite you i set the whole thing up  what now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that  i thought it would be good for you  just like you deceived our son into going to kennys and that didnt work either  im doing the best i can  my final solution by kyle broslofski my dad is the smartest guy in the whole wide world  he has taught me that all poor people are actually things called clods  i wanna live in a world of only gods so my idea to make america better  is to put all poor people into camps   what  if we get rid of them  there will be nothing but rich people  and there wont be any hunger poverty or homeless people   cause theyll all be dead the end  oh god what have i done   whats happening here terrance  were doing and anal transplant its our only hope   whos the doner  i am phillip i am   terrance youre giving up your ass for me  just half my ass  can you believe it phillip  here we are best friends and now were going to share the same ass  oh
