to jail to rot in his cell and everything is back to normal  and i guess the only thing left to say is  god bless us everyone  and i guess thats what ive learned im sorry for what ive did but that doesnt make up for it  i deserve to be in jail ill i hope is that i dont make mankind lose faith in itself  yes theres murders in the world and rapists and thieves but those are the vast minority  the majority of mankind is made up of caring people who try everyday to do what they think is right  and thats the spirit of the season   what do you think guys  it sucks just like all your other books   well goodnight you guys happy holidays  shut up  what was that   what the  merry christmas charlie manson  hark the herald angels sing  glory to the newborn king  peace on earth and mercy mild  god and sinner reconciled  joyful all ye nations rise  join the triumph of the skies  hark the herald angels sing  this is pretty fucked up right here
