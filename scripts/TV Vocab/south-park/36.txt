pounds craig at 45  uh how long do you expect the fight to last  however long craig wants it to last  mamake no mistake craig has been ready for this fight since day one  he doesnt even view it as a challenge  hell view it as a challenge when hes getting his ass kicked  huh did you hear that it sounds like diarreah  comming out of someones mouth or something  shut up fatass  dont call me fat you son of a bitch   wow tweek and craig really hate each other huh this will be a good fight  on your first day look at the mans shoes  sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes  when he takes you out to dinner  try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you  if he only has one credit card beware  it means he doesnt spend a lot and worse yet it could be a debit card  if he has more than four credit cards thats a little fishy  the perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is two yes bebe  what if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or lawyer  but is still getting his degree  dump that zero and get yourself a hero  he could be earning that degree all his life  while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats  when i have you guys ten bucks  im gonna use it to buy the sweetest bigscreen tv in the world  thats more than ten bucks you stupid fatass  well if i get ten bucks from each of you  thats like two thousand dollars  hey
