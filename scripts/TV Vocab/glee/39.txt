guess sue was hiding it in offshore accounts  in the cayman islands and were having some trouble  accessing some of it  any of it  this is salt water taffy  ah i love salt water  when i was a student here we paid for our entire trip  to nationals selling this  classroom to classroom  door to door  we pushed this stuff like crack  and so will we  so to make 5000  at 25 cents apiece  we need to sell 20000 pieces of taffy  wait do you honestly think that we can sell 20000 anythings  i mean we won regionals  for the first time since dinosaurs roamed the planet  and i still got a freaking cherry icee facial  oh my god im so sorry  yeah santana is right  nobody cares about us  i cant listen to this  mike are you okay  no  you guys complain all the time about being mistreated  but you have no

reigning champion  at this school will be usurped  im asking you for your help  our mission to destroy the glee club  well target their fragile sense of selfesteem  so that they implode long before they can make it to nationals  and i call this union  the league of doom  ooh  okay first of all that is a ridiculous name  and second of all what kind of a meeting  doesnt have bagels or something  wow it would be hard to be married to you  and for the record or mixed nuts  i am trying to move on with my life  i dont hate will schuester  but you do hate the glee club  thats true i do  and i am

league of doom you can count me in  although i am enjoying my second career  as a smalltime medical marijuana dealer  okeydokey it doesnt change the fact  that william took my job  here are your beepers  you will await further instructions  and until then we will be known only as  the legion of evil i dont think i was listening when you said what our name was  wait a second is it league or legion  worst henchmen ever  i missed you so much last week  so what do you want to do tomorrow night  whoa there cowboy we havent even had our pizza yet  im just trying to get you when i can  you

a relationship with me meant  being in a constant state of wanting  i am both awesome and unavailable at the same time  youre kind of awesome  what do you think about my taffy sale plan  to send the brainiacs to detroit  um i think its as terrible as the word  brainiacs but  oh okay heres your problem all right  youre thinking too small okay  that crazy exwife of yours messed with your brain  and now you think you cant dream  okay well whats your idea  a night of neglect  that actually sounds like life with my exwife  hilarious no seriously heres what you need to do  have a benefit  you know how they do on tv when theres like an earthquake  or they want to raise money for like a sad disease  thats actually a really good idea  i know it is  see your kids are feeling really neglected right  so you fill the auditorium with people who are there  to hear them sing and poof  oh im loving this  and we can sell tickets  and it is a perfect place to practice for nationals  and you know the best part  were only going to do songs by neglected artists  because its a night of neglect  can you define what you mean by neglected artist  um someone whose brilliance isnt always appreciated  oh so you mean like me  i mean like all of us  all right everyone next saturday night  in our auditorium  mckinley highs first annual  night of neglect fundraiser benefit is officially a go  sergeant handsome walk with me  im surprised you even saw me  i was blending in pretty well back there  heres your mission word on the street is that schuester  and that substitute holly holliday are official  i need you to break them up  shes looser than a thrift store turtleneck  and probably just as diseased  just my type  psst ready for my closeup general zog  sandy how do you manage to enter a building  without setting off all the fire alarms  you know i have to say with all this sneaking around  i have never felt more alive  whats my assignment  pink dagger i just learned  that the glee club is performing a benefit concert  its just the opening we need  theres a student club i want you to sponsor  heckling  the worlds second oldest profession  hell am i doing in here  good louder  in olden times  hecklers provided a needed service  to the medieval community pink dagger if i may  welcome to the very first meeting of the heckling club  you set me up you told me  i was supposed to come here to get homework help  congratulations youre all in  im really confused  im totally doing lykke li  shes bjork meets florence and the machine  and a promising new talent  what about you mike  the mike chang dance dance revolution  im tired of my dancing being overshadowed  by all of you guys singing  its going to be just me and my sweet moves  on that stage  youre forgetting about the most neglected artist  this glee clubs ever seen  aretha franklin  neglected shes like the queen of soul  see i auditioned for this club  singing respect and shes gotten none since  so im doing aretha  awesome mercedes  awesome all of you guys  those songs are great appetizers to my main course  celine dions my heart will go on  its gonna be our finale  thats like the biggest song of all time  no you dont understand  celine isnt the neglected artist i am  i was kind of hoping to do the closing number  hey you guys remember sunshine corazon  you are a terrible spy  seriously with your size  you easily could have stayed in the air ducts for days  im not a spy  i heard about your benefit concert on facebook  and i wanted to perform  i know what it feels like to be in academic decathlon  no one pays attention to you no one cares  its not right we study so hard  yeah but youre in vocal adrenaline  how do we know we can trust you  because i have nothing against any of you  i have 600 twitter followers i can get all of them to come  how many tickets have we sold so far  four no ones interested its just sad  please just let me show you what i can do  i would like to sing the perfect song about neglect  all by myself  im such a better singer than everyone else  so i know how it feels  im all alone at the top  also im really short so even when im in a group of people  it feels like im wandering alone through a forest  theres no way that shes singing in our auditorium okay  shes the enemy  i say we give her a chance i mean you owe her rachel  you sent her to a frickin crack house  when i was young   i never needed anyone   and making love was just for fun   those days are gone   living alone   i think of all the friends ive known   when i dial the telephone   nobodys home   all by myself   dont wanna be   all by myself   anymore   all by myself   dont wanna live   all by myself   anymore   go on now  dont wanna live by myself by myself anymore   by myself   anymore   whoa ohoh ohoh   come on  so can i perform with you guys  absolutely not shes just trying  to get on our good sides so she can spy on us  youre one to talk we told you  the same thing about jesse st james last year   and you were right  this whole thing  isnt about us its about helping the brainiacs  yeah we need sunshines  twitter followers to come and pay for tickets  or theres no point in having a benefit at all  fine mercedes youre okay with being bumped  to the decidedly less glamorous middle spot  right  um sure i guess  absolutely  hey mercedes can i have your shoes  i promise to give you a dirty pair of my flipflops in return  do you know how hard it is  to find hightop yellow patent leather sneakers  really im surprised  you didnt just give them to me considering  how little you think of yourself  youre the most talented singer in glee club  yet youre constantly taking the backseat to everyone  well what am i supposed to do  imim tired of fighting with rachel all the time  okay youre always singing about respect  but respect isnt something you can ask for  you have to demand it  and you deserve it  you dont seem to have trouble in that department  right you know what  neither does aretha or jlo or mariah  you know why because they get proof every day  i heard mariah makes appointments at 900 am  and shows up at 400 in the afternoon  because she knows people will wait  but those kinds of demands are ridiculous  exactly but once you see that no matter  how ridiculous your demands people will meet them  you know you have it have what  respect and as your manager  id say youre thinking too small  wait a minute since when are you my manager  since you agreed to give me ten percent  of whatever we can come up with to ask for  sister you got yourself a deal  are you okay  yup i will be as soon as this counters really clean  i hear that ocd symptoms tend to get worse  when the person is under great stress  carls gone  he asked for an annulment  which i guess  hes legally entitled to  considering we never actually consummated the marriage  you guys never  at what age are you allowed  to look back on your life with nothing but regret  is 32 too young  i actually believed  that id have a handle on my ocd by now  its just been so long and  im so tired  this your lunch  yeah  what are you doing  one day youre going to find a way to beat this thing  until then  im here for you  no judgment  just  a friend that you can count on  cheers  so uh the braniacs  asked us to be benefit heads for the night of neglect  and we would like to select you  head of talent relations  we figured youre probably used to relating  to talent because youre so talented  well first im honored that you came to me  but i think its a little insensitive of you to be  flaunting your dating in my face fantastic  cause we are having problems with one of our performers  a i need a bowl of green mms  and by bowl i mean large bowl well really a small barrel  o kay  two i need humidifiers  lots of humidifiers a team of humidifiers  whose only job is to make  the air that mercedes breathes more humid  well try our best shh im not finished  before every performance i like to wash my hands  and after doing so i like to dry them on a fresh puppy  excuse me i believe you heard ms jones  in fact if i were you id probably get a whole litter  of fluffy puppies just in case she decides  to take a postshow shower  stars make demands the way that babies  make messes in their diapers  they cant help it what a star wants is  to just feel appreciated and respected  they just want to feel like theyre being heard  she seemed pretty serious about the puppy  well obviously hers is a talent that we have neglected  i can relate  so leave it to me ill take care of it  hello class  i am the worlds most famous and stylish divorcee  wallace simpson  i was married a bunch of times and then i fell in love  with edward viii and made him abdicate the throne  i had giant hands so a lot of people thought  i was a hermaphrodite but that wasnt true others said  i was a nazi sympathizer  that was true  boy did i think that hitler showed promise  tomorrow were gonna do  catherine the great and her pet stallion fred so come early  we havent been introduced  im dustin goolsby coach of vocal adrenaline  oh  so youre the big competition at nationals  well thank you very much for volunteering your star  for our night of neglect benefit  what are you talking about i never approved that  let me cut to the sexy chase  think about how many more years  you have left of productive ovulating  those arent eggs in those fallopian tubes  theyre rare exotic pearls  oh so youre trying to seduce me  jackpot this hairline is 85 my own  and my sperm count is off the charts  well  as tempting as that sounds i have a boyfriend  yeah you do now  admit it im handsome  im goodlooking and im easy on the eyes  also im gorgeous  and im dating will schuester  let me tell you something about will schuester  that guy has tiny baby hands  seriously its weird  once i saw him try to pick up a big mac and he couldnt do it  he had to eat it layer by layer  teeny tiny wee  baby hands  that are big enough to knock your teeth out  well this is awkward  consider my offer  what offer  he was just hitting on me  isnt that silly  whats wrong  well we were supposed to have lunch and you dont show  and now youre getting hit on by the coach of our archrival  how is that my fault  and by the way i did show up for lunch  and you looked like you were actually having  a pretty good time  i kind of felt like i was intruding so  oh man i am  i am not the jealous type will  neither am i  look how about instead of a pointless argument  we rehearse our duet for the benefit  i really dont uh feel in the mood to do a duet right now  i think i just have to clear my head  uh no problem  ill see you at the benefit  well as you can see we have followed  your exact specifications  wait wheres my puppy  she specifically asked for a puppy  this is unbelievable  how am i supposed to work like this dont worry puckerman is  out right now scouring pounds for the perfect pomeranian  good this is almost worthy of the artist  doing the closing number at the benefit  well actually um sunshine  is going to be doing the last number because  shes bringing in hundreds of people  and so ill go on  before sunshine because im well me  and uh ms holliday and mercedes will go on before me  fine  but ms jones isnt happy about it  in exchange shes demanding  that during the day of the benefit her feet  never touch the ground excuse me  oh did you not see celines wedding carried in  chers comeback tour carried in  gaga at the grammys  carried the hell in  um im sorry areare  you saying that you want to be carried in in a giant egg  well get back to you  and that was the spanish classroom  and of course you know the choir room  hey you guys you better  get in the auditorium the shows

really cool  bye  oh you miss them  what the hell are you two doing here  were here for the benefit dont tell me youre going  i wouldnt be caught dead  i was pumping iron in the gym  and one of the guys told me you two were here  spreading your fairy dust all over the place  would you just give it up  you can live whatever lie you want but dont pretend  the three of us dont know whats really going on here  you dont know squat butt boy  hey no guys stop real brave with your fists  but youre a coward when it comes to the truth  truth about what its none of your business j lo  first of all

here and i crack one of your nuts  right or left thats your choice or you walk away  and live to be a douchebag another day  oh and also i have razorblades hidden in my hair  mmhmm tons  just all up

shes not coming and neither are any of her followers  i told you shes evil  i was just in the auditorium  theres like six people in there  i say we blow this whole thing off and hit the arcade  no no screw that  these people paid to see us sing  whats that saying  the shows got to go all over the place or something  you mean the show must go on yeah  finns right you guys  okay whether theres six

guys i hate to say it but i think we have to buck up  tina im sorry you had to go through that  but its actually a really good lesson for us  i mean thats a part of show business guys  sometimes people can be really mean  think about whats going to happen  if we have an unfriendly crowd at nationals in new york  and im sure theres going  to be some vocal adrenaline hecklers there too  we need to find some strength and barrel through this  i think i may know a way to shut those hecklers up  for a number or two  take as much as you want  thanks babe ill take two  and remember  vote quinn fabray for prom queen  and now please enjoy the dance stylings  of mr mike chang as he busts some moves  to jack johnsons bubble toes  its as simples as something that nobody knows   that her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes   on the feet of a queen   of the hearts of the cards   and her feet are all covered with tar balls   and so   well i was eating lunch at the dlg   when this little girl came and she sat next to me   never seen nobody move the way she did   well she did and she does and shell do it again   when you move like a jellyfish rhythm is nothing   you go with the flow you dont stop   hmm   its as common as something that nobody knows   that her beauty will follow wherever she goes   up the hill in the back of her house   in the wood shell love me forever i know   she la da da da da da   la da da da da da da la   if you would only listen   you might just realize what youre missing   youre missing me   its as simple as something that nobody knows   that her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes   on the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards   he feet are infested with tar balls   and la da da da da da   la da da da da da da   la da da da da da   la da da da da da da da   bravo whoo  yeah  that was all kinds of awesome yeah  terrific job mike whoo  hey sounds like the heckling club loved our refreshments  yeah but were almost out of that taffy  how are we going to keep them  from going after us again after the intermission  by being so good that they cant heckle us  and i know just the person for the job  wwheres mercedes  shes up  im sorry ms jones has not appreciated  the way shes been treated  and is refusing to go on  let me talk to her  dont bother mercedes has left the building  okay you guys go find mercedes  im gonna go deal with the haters  are we in trouble  oh no not at all  i was just taking the opportunity of intermission  to tell you guys what great hecklers you are  you must practice a lot  no not that much just on the internet only  you know my posts on ncis and miami chat rooms are legendary  youre kidding ive never seen you on there  you wouldnt because i post as ncisucks or ncistupid  im the beckster on the entertainment weekly chatrooms  and my curlyhairincairo twitter account  helped bring down mubarak  technology has allowed us to be brutally cruel  without suffering any consequences  in the past if i wanted to tell someone they sucked  id have to say it to their face  which would usually result  in them kicking me in the groin  i get it we live in a culture of insults  i mean were constantly bombarded with these  images of people who are richer than us and happier than us  and have more interesting sex than us and it makes us feel terrible  preach  you know we tear them down to feel better about ourselves  and we dont just stop with the people who are on tv  or in magazines we do it to everybody  and we think that because its done anonymously  there are no ramifications  but there are ramifications guys  because it makes you comfortable with insensitivity  do you know that one of the girls you heckled tonight  has been crying for an hour  are you saying you never ragged on anybody  oh of course i did i spent three years  sending hate mail to debbie gibson  until she wrote me back and said  that the stress of my letters was giving her alopecia  and then i felt terrible  because i realized it was just my jealousy  that she could fill a mall with her adoring fans  you guys are great kids  some of those insults were rad  but just think about how you could lift up the world  if you turned some of those barbs into roses  i mean intermissions almost over why dont you get back  in there and turn some of that jeering into cheering  na no i think im just going to go home  probably do a new post about how handsome mark harmon is  me too im out  im splitting too  they say if you have nothing nice to say  ill be 18 in three years  wait for me  let me in let me in  come on its raining  weve all been looking for you  dont bother with the pep talk im not going back in there  my demands were not met  have you ever read anything about aretha franklin  she was a gospel singer  and one day she went to thisthis show  nothing fancy it was just like a state fair  and the master of ceremonies  hands her a tiara and calls her the queen of soul  and thats how she earned her crown  thats how she gained all of her respect  not byby requesting for special pillows  oror food but  singing  i just dont get it  why are you a bigger star than me  you always get the big solos  the best songs the moments in the sun  why is it never me  i dont know  i mean youre just as good of a singer as i am  yeah and everyone actually likes me  thats your problem  because i would rather be a star than be liked  andand  im not saying that its healthy  and im not saying that its better than being loved  but theres nothing  nothing that i wouldnt do  for the chance to be in the spotlight  i just  really wanted that closing slot  well if you want that closing slot  then go in there and take it from me  where is everybody lets get on with it  youre a really horrible person you know that  you sound like my courtappointed therapist  pink dagger im going to need to speak with you right now  yes general  you know i had a feeling you might be behind this  you have no proof  and
