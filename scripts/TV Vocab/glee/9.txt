                1 you shouldnt do this to yourself  do what  i know how much it hurts to be off the team  youre just torturing yourself watching them  i needed a good distraction  from what  685  thats how much a sonogram costs  this is just the beginning  theres going to be more doctors visits  vitamins new clothes for when i explode  what are we going to do  what are you going to do  im looking for a job  i mean no ones hiring  i almost got in at olive garden  but they said i was too tall to be a busboy  somewhere in that pea brain of yours is a man  access him and tell him to prove to me  that i chose the right guy to have a baby with  i will  iill find a job  you can count on me i swear  where you going  you were right  this does hurt too much  my blog has lit up with comments  suggesting you dont have a shot at nationals  since you lost quinn fabray  no the cheerios are stronger than ever  were gonna take nationals with this routine  mediocre  hit the showers  bell ringing  i have several sources reporting  quinn didnt want to leave  but you kicked her out because of the pregnancy scandal  well jacob this is ohio  and in order to win my cheerios need  to appeal to that panel of judges  so if i have a pregnant girl doing a handspring into a double layout  the judges arent going to be admiring her impeccable form  theyre going to be wondering if the centrifugal force  is going to make the babys head start crowning  oh and by the way all this off the record  probably should have told you that earlier  this isnt fair  is it fair that i had to stop providing the baseball team  with protective cups  i only get a certain amount of dollars a year  to spend william  yeah but artie is  is used to overcoming challenges  hell just have to find his own ride to sectionals  that handicapable bus costs 600 a week to rent  we cant afford it  oh but theres enough money in the budget  to fly the cheerios all over the country for their competitions  sue sylvester has boosters that write fat checks  none of her travel expenses come out of the school budget  look when i was in the glee club  the best part of the competitions  was the bus ride to the event  it was about camaraderie and supporting each other  you think i feel good about this  well my students wont stand for it  thats very moving but my hands are tied shue  if you want that bus youre going to have to find a way  to pay for it yourself  sighs   bell ringing  what about target  tried not hiring  another doctor bill came to my parents house last night finn  were lucky that im clever and intercepted it  but we have to start paying these doctors bills  or theyre going to go to a collection agency  and then my parents are going to find out that im with child  your child  will all right guys  were doing a new number for sectionals  i know that pop songs  have sort of been our signature pieces  but i did a little research on past winners  and it turns out that the judges like songs  that are more accessible  stuff they know  uh standards  broadway  defying gravity  i have an ipod shuffle dedicated exclusively  to selections from wicked  this is amazing  think you can handle it rachel  its my goto shower song  its also my ringtone  mercedes why do we have to go all vanilla on this song  see what we need  is my chocolate thunder  okay we dont have time to rearrange a song  for you mercedes rachel is singing it  dont worry well find something for you  to dip in chocolate  laughter  on to item two  the school wont pay for the special bus we need  to take artie and his wheelchair with us to sectionals  wwwhat  thats completely unfair  so were going to have to raise money to pay for it ourselves  see when i was in glee club  and we needed new silk cummerbunds for regionals  we held a bake sale  scattered laughter  santana youre joking right  i mean bake sales are kind of bougie  so hip people stopped eating delicious sugary treats  its not that  its most of us dont know how to bake  i find recipes confusing  my family is fully committed to takeout  yeah mr shue kids are busier than when you went here  weve got homework and football and teen pregnancy lunch  cant arties dad just take him  i cant believe how insensitive youre all being  are you a team  of course  but artie understands dont you artie  oh of course  its cool  anything that takes away our time from rehearsing  doesnt serve the team  bell ringing  let me help you out buddy thank you  hey im really sorry about how they all reacted artie  oh its okay im used to it  they just dont get it  can i use the auditorium this afternoon  to rehearse mr shue  some of the band equipments in there  sure  playing jazzy version of dancing with myself  fingers snapping rhythmically    on the floor of tokyoo      or down in london town to goo      with the record selection with the mirror reflection      im dancing with myself      when theres no one else in sight      in a crowded lonely niight      well i wait so long for my love vibration      and im dancing with myself      im dancing with myself      im dancing with myself      well theres nothing to lose and theres nothing to prove      and ill be dancing with myself      if i looked all over the world      and theres every type of giirl      but your empty eyes seem to pass me by      and leave me dancing with myself      so lets sink another drink      cause itll give me time to thiink      if i had the chance id ask the world to dance      and ill be dancing with myself      oh dancing with myself      oh dancing with myself      oh theres nothing to lose and theres nothing to prove      ill be dancing with myself      oh dancing with myself      oh dancing with myself   music fades out    oh theres nothing to lose and theres nothing to prove      and ill be dancing with myself    bell ringing  i have something id like to say  i want to audition for the wicked solo  murmured encouragement  kurt theres a high f in it  thats well within my range  well i think rachels going to be fine  for the female lead but im happy to have you  try out something else kurt  and well make sure its got a killer high note  students murmuring  artie you tried anyway  i wanted to say something to you guys  i was a little disappointed at how you were all so willing  to take the bus to get to sectionals  and make artie drive by himself with his dad  were a team guys  were in this glee club together  artie doesnt care  his dad drives him everywhere  i do care  it kind of hurt my feelings  we didnt think you would take it personally  well youre irritating most of the time  but dont take that personally  i dont know if you guys really understand  how much harder artie has to work just to keep up  preach  were riding to sectionals together  or were not going at all  and to pay for the bus were having a bake sale  bake sale st ignatius nursing home  was having a tag sale  and my av club friends here agreed to help out  for the next week  each of you is going to spend three hours a day  in a wheelchair  oh oh oh  and were doing a wheelchair number  dancing with myself playing  billy idol   on the floors of tokyoo      or down in london town to gogo      with the record selection and the mirrors reflection      im dancing with myself      well theres nothing to lose and theres nothing to prove      well im dancing with myself      oh oh oh    song ends  puck i didnt even know we had a home ec room  whats all this  ingredients for cupcakes  for the stupid bake sale  whats this  its what i have left over from my pool cleaning money  after i bought dip and nunchakus  i was getting that you kinda need money  for our kid  for my kid   how much has finn given you  just stop  i told you before  i dont care if that baby comes out with a mohawk  i will go to my grave swearing its finns  it would be pretty awesome if it came out with a mohawk  you are such an egghead  im not  giggling  laughing  sighing  squealing ah  that was perfectly measured  squealing laughing  there you go  laughter  what the hell  chuckles sighing  were baking  i can see that  im gonna go change  wheres my jelly creme center  sorry dad i mustve forgotten  whats up with your brain today  you know i think its going soft  from all that crap you put in your hair  its organic and im fine  im sorry its a glee club thing  its not about a guy is it  cause im not ready to have that conversation  oh at least you dont have to worry about me  getting someone pregnant chuckling  its not a guy  were doing this amazing song for sectionals  a personal favorite of mine  and mr schuester wont give me a chance to sing it  why  its traditionally sung by a girl  well you sing like a girl  you know in a good way  look kurt i dont know  how this music stuff works  im pretty exclusively committed to my mellencamp collection  but isnt there more crossover nowadays  you know chicks doing construction  guys wearing dress shoes with no socks  didnt that girl from your high school  just join the boys wrestling team  whistle blowing yes  whoo  yes but her parents had to sue the school  this is really getting you down isnt it  im full of ennui  so its really getting you down  yes  you cant discriminate against my kid because of his sex  religion political affiliation  or the fact that hes queer as a three dollar bill  and i wont accept it  this isnt academics  or athletics mr hummel  its an arts program and mr schuesters  judgments are subjective  you put on a blindfold and listen to my kid sing  and you will swear youre hearing ronnie spector  wait dont try to backpedal on this schuester  i was just going to agree with you  i know this is going to be hard on you rachel  but i cant in good conscience  preach about the importance of helping artie  and then reject kurts request out of hand  so youre giving him my part  now i cant just give him the part  that would be just as wrong but i can let him audition  what do you mean like a tryout  all right that seems fair  this is totally unfair you gave me the part  and i will give it to you again  if you can sing the song better than kurt  okay this seems like a reasonable deal  but how do i know this isnt just some show  to stop me from taking a flamethrower  to this place  whos going to judge  now all of you are going to judge  and in the spirit of full access  each of you is going to get a vote  whatever singer has the most votes  gets the part  this isnt going to be about talent mr schuester  its going to be a popularity contest  stop right there mr shue if i may  we all know im more popular than rachel  and i dress better than her  but i want you all to promise me that youre  going to vote for whoever sings the song better  raise your right hand  your right hand brittany  its this one sorry  repeat after me  i promise to vote for whoever sings the song better  all i promise to vote for whoever sings the song better  its on  bell ringing  all right guys  maybe one of these days youll find a way to create  teaching moments without ruining my life  gentle piano melody plays  discordant notes play  shue i saw all your kids in wheelchairs  and i was very impressed  well thank you principal figgins  but actually its made me realize that theres only  one wheelchair entrance in this school  and its all the way on the far end of campus  mckinley needs ramps  no way those are what i call  lazy makers  they discourage our ablebodied students  from getting their proper exercise by using the stairs  what is she doing here  yes what am i doing here  i have a cheerios routine to polish  thats gonna clinch us nationals  i brought you two in here  because both of you have a point  handicapped ramps are expensive  but inspiration is free  will im so inspired by your stunt that im insisting  that ms sylvester do the same with the cheerios  i beg your pardon  cheerios is not accessible sue  its by invitation only  i want to see a squad  that reflects our communitys diversity  now glee club held open auditions  and everyone got in  now that quinn fabray  is off the squad you will hold open auditions  to fill her slot  and mr schuester  will monitor them to make sure  that they are fair to all  okay let me break this down for you here  there comes a point  when youve got to stop seeing people for what they look like  and ask them to show you what they can do  and as soon as a cheerleader  rolls herself out onto the field in a wheelchair  she becomes decidedly less effective at cheering people up  its just a fact  no sue the fact is youve never given other students  the fair shake that they deserve  im asking you to try it  what do you have to lose  maybe somebody at this school will surprise you  finn cupcake  these cupcakes suck thats why were not selling any  its not about the cupcakes its about us  nobody wants to buy from losers  were in glee club and in wheelchairs  she has a point  six months ago i couldve sold  on fear alone  oh my god what is she doing  i actually think theyre kind of friends  brittany is always cheating off her test papers in math class  see so many  and look how pretty they are becky  wow  brittany youre supposed to be in your wheelchair  i lost it  are you a cheerleader  its so cool  so is buying a cupcake  thats really cool  but i dont have any money  thats okay i have some  thanks  so how much do we have now  well with this one dollar we have one dollar  this is ridiculous  well maybe if we put a jelly bean or something  on top wed sell more are you an idiot  how am i supposed to trust you to take care of our baby  when you cant even figure out how to sell a damn cupcake  stop attacking me im sick of it  get a job  im trying  chair clattering  quinn scoffs  sighs  sue i dont know what im supposed to be doing here  you just call a name they come in and try out  just give them a chance to express themselves  im about to projectile express myself  all over your hush puppies  mckinley hey hey  mckinley hey hey  no  baton clattering echoing  no  youre not serious are you  tell me youre not serious  no  no friggin way jacob  lightly groaning  freak  okay ive been at this for an hour thats all i promised  sue theres just one more person on the list  give her a shot  becky johnson  jackson jackson  sotto voce be nice sue  i heard that youre doing a routine with

line  you dont know what im dealing with  all i know is that youre a punk  who doesnt deserve to have quinn as his girlfriend  youre a punk  grunting groaning  will hey hey break it up  break it up  come on  hey he started it  i dont care  now  sighing  youyou guys are best friends  what the hell is going on  im just really stressed about the bake sale  i really like artie okay  you okay  the key to a double turn is to just go for it  you push with the right wheel and pull as hard as you can  with the left and find a spot on the wall to spot you  so you dont get dizzy  will okay guys take five all right  oh remember to show up early on thursday  its rachel versus kurt  for the big solo  careful  artie respect the chair  i really admire you artie  i had no idea how difficult this was  its just like you with your stutter  you dont really notice it after awhile  hohohow did it happen  you dont talk about it  my mom and i got in a really bad car accident  when i was eight  and she was fine but ive been in the chair ever since  but i want to be very clear  i still have the use of my penis  singing ascending high notes  phone ringing excuse me a second  singing continues  singing

the solo because its right for the club  i really think that the judges at sectionals  will find a female version of defying gravity  much more accessible  but i dont think thats going to happen  people just dont like me  yeah you might want to work on that  but i like you  we need to talk  ill get out of your way  no you stay i need a witness  do you know what this is  oh its just a past due notice  my mom gets them all the time  right but if this sonogram bill doesnt get paid  its not your phone thats going to get cut off  you will get cut off  you need to help me with this finn  or else were going to go our separate ways  im screwed  not necessarily  i know i know i know i know  hey hey guys hey guys this is amazing  santana hi  puck found his nana connies old recipe  theyre

sniper  i would have already radioed in your coordinates  just like in the falklands  im not going to let you bully that girl sue  oh i bully everybody will  its the way i roll  yeah but this is different  shes not like everybody else  i want you to listen to what you just said william  youre asking me to treat this girl differently  because she has a disability  when actually it seems to me  she just wants to be treated like everybody else  why are you doing this  because i know you  and youre up to something  you dont know the first thing about me  good luck  quietly im rooting for you  all right welcome to the glee clubs  first official divaoff  cheering  lets get this party started  piano playing defying gravity intro    something has changed within me      something is not the

person  to realize that we are not going to take money  from a friend in a wheelchair  hey  here  whats this  i got a job  excuse me  are you the manager yes  you need to hire my friend finn  he is clearly handicapable and refusing to hire him  could be seen as discrimination  my dads are gay and unless you want the full force  of the american civil liberties union coming down on you  id work

really appreciate what you guys did for me  but im not the only kid in a wheelchair at this school  and im sure there will be others after i graduate  and i know how important it is for all of us to go  to sectionals together  but i think id rather just get a ride from my dad  and use this for a handicapped ramp in the auditorium  any objections  well sure beats having to carry him in every day  chuckling  you think she has a brain tumor  that can cause erratic behavior  all i know is that she walked in unannounced  and she wrote me a check for three new handicapped ramps  i just dont get it  i mean first putting becky in cheerios now this  what is her angle  why ask why  just enjoy the fact that youre getting your bus after all  hows she doing great  she asks about you  shes been watching you on tv  i need to get here more often  oh you get here plenty  jean  your little sisters here to see you  hey sue hi hi honey  my sister is famous  you got that right  i got something for you

push people away anymore  you understand what thats like dont you  no i dont  i would never try to push people away  cause being in a chair kind of does that for you  i thought we had something really important in common  wait artie im sorry  i am too  im sorry now you get to be normal  and im going to be stuck in this chair the rest of my life  and thats not something i can fake  drill whirrs
