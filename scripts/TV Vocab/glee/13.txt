mouth  kurt wants in  i say we lock rachel up until after sectionals  i volunteer my basement we cant  we need her to sing damn her talent  we just heard who told  we assumed it was you  why would i do that  to get back at puck arent you guys dating  sex is not dating  if it were santana and i would be dating  look i dont want to rock the boat  since quinn got pregnant im top dog around here  hold up rachels walking by  hey hot mama  shes gone  look i know i screwed up  telling all you guys about quinn and puck  and i feel really terrible about it  but we cannot let rachel figure this out

now it doesnt have to happen in broad daylight  really i want to do this will  i want to take the kids to sectionals  okay but what about ken  i mean hehes going to be furious  i appealed to him as an educator  you will always choose schuester over me  he wont even be there ken  i am doing this for the kids i really thought  that you of all people would understand this  this time i dont think that i do  he took it great  just great  laughs  i cant thank you enough  school bell rings  rachel hey  i know its not my place but have you had your doctor run  the full genetic test panel on your unborn child  i only ask  because my cousin leon and his wife got pregnant  and then they found out that he was a carrier for taysachs  whats that  its a genetic disorder  pretty terrible from what i understand  if one of the parents is a carrier  then theres like a 50 chance that the child has it  or something like that  no leons leons baby was fine  stammering it was still pretty scary though  my doctor never mentioned that  you know im such an idiot  they would only run the test if one of the parents was jewish  yeah only jews carry the gene oh  okay ill see you in rehearsal school bell ringing  you have to take me to go get those jewish baby tests  why is that even a real thing  because if something is wrong with the baby  terri schuester isnt going to take it  and i cant ask finn

numbers  the kids are completely freaking out  artie keeps ramming himself into the wall  and im pretty sure jacob ben israel wet himself  i knew it  sue leaked the set list  will  will these kids need a leader right now  just hold tight  i know what to do  okay  sue  what kind of teacher are you  hey buddy i just came by to feed my venus flytrap  you leaked the set list  and you are not going to get away with it  that is a libelous accusation  and i insist you retract it immediately  you have no proof  no proof  you are the only person who had the list  but other than that you have no proof  its time to face facts william  at 100 pm this afternoon  your little club will have had its shot at the big time  and they will have failed  glee club will be canceled  and all that money figgins has been funneling  into your budget will finally  and rightfully be restored to mine  you have crossed the line  i am not going to sit idly by anymore  i am going to expose you  for the fraud that you have become  bring it on william  im reasonably confident  that you will be adding revenge  to the long list of things youre no good at  right next to being being married  dont  running a high school glee club  and finding a hairstyle  that doesnt make you look like a lesbian  love ya like a sista  get your hands off me  youre not going to push a woman are you  i didnt think so  hey finn  i just called your mom she told me youd be here  yeah you know football season ended  so im just cleaning out my things  sounds like something that couldve waited till monday  you heard anything  yeah  its pretty bad  i cant be there  and i can  i cant even  be in the same room as her without crying like a girl  i cant look at him without wanting to punch his face off  i dont have any more pep talks finn  you know i know how you feel  all i know is that  between you and me  i dont think that they can win without you  but thats not fair  why does it always have to come down to me  why do i always have to be the bigger man  because sometimes being special  sucks  i just want everything to be like it  like it never happened you know  well finn  you cant always get what you want  listen ill be in the choir room  oh mr shue you forgot your keys  no i didnt  nope your moneys no good here im buying  celebratory giant pretzels  i dont feel much like celebrating  why not  one of us is going to take this thing  hi  nice set list  of course i havent heard your deaf kids perform yet  but i hear theyre doing dont stop believing  um who are you  im so sorry let me introduce myself  im emma pillsbury  im the faculty advisor for the mckinley high school glee club  oh what happened to the white guy with the jheri curl  you should be ashamed arent you ashamed  youre educators  actually no you know what youre more than that  you take care of disadvantaged kids  and youre teaching them that  the only way they can compete in this world is by cheating  im sorry but what kind of message is that  i dont know what youre talking about  dont stop believing is the most downloaded song  in the history of itunes  ive only got one good ear  and even i know that scarlet fever  right and proud mary  in wheelchairs  do you have any idea  how much winning is going to mean to my girls  its going to be a life changer  make them feel like theyre worth something again  imim sorry do you do you think  that theyre not going to know that somethings up  the fact that you just magically came up  with two brandnew numbers days before competition  they were great up there  thats all i know i think  what we have here is a case of deaf racism  shame on you  no you know what the real shame is  is that maybe if you believed in them just a little bit more  they wouldve been amazing up there  without cheating         dont stop believing      hold on to that feeling      streetlight people    holding note  meeting in the green room in five minutes    dont stop believing    you leaked the set list you dont want to be here  you were just sue sylvesters little moles  i know for a fact thats true  sue asked us to spy for her  santana look we may still be cheerios  but neither of us ever gave sue the set list  well ii did but i didnt know  what she was going to do with it  okay look believe what you want  but no ones forcing me to be here  and if you ever tell anyone this ill deny it  but i like being in glee club  its the best part of my day okay  i wasnt going to go and mess it up  i believe you  okay look guys theres no point in us arguing anymore  wewe have go on in an hour  and we have no songs  perhaps i could improvise some of my def poetry jams  no no  look were going to do this the right way  lets start with the ballad  mercedes do you have anything else in your repertoire  yeah but its not as good  as anything youre going to sing  no we we agreed we agreed  that i would sing and im telling you  and that aint happening  look rachel  the truth is youre the best singer that weve got  kurt as much as it hurts me to admit it and it does  shes right  rachels our star  if anyone is going  to go belt it on the fly it should be her  well i do have something  that ive been working on since i was four  then i guess we have our ballad and we can close  with somebody to love  its a real crowdpleaser  yeah that and a can of soup will guarantee us third place  we still need another song  we can all sing together  i have one  sighs  i found the sheet music online  i used the cheerios copier to make copies  and then i trashed the thing  mike matt  brittany santana youre our best dancers  figure something out and well all follow your lead  its going to be choppy good  were best when were loose  look all we have going for us is that we believe in ourselves  and what were singing about  if we can show the judges that  we might have a shot at this thing  its good to have you back finn  you cool if i take my spot back  quite  i was just here because i was hoping  to get into rachels pants  sighs  we cool dude  no  finn  you okay  dont worry about me  okay this is all up to you now  you wanted the solo you wanted  the chance to be the star  this is your chance

honking  and everyone was crying and i was like get off the stage  youre terrible and youre making me super uncomfortable  now hold on just a second candy  those haverhurst kids twice had me reaching for my handkerchief  and those jane addams girls had it going on  in all the right places  woman can i just say something  i have no idea what the hell im doing here  im serious  i dont understand what a glee club is  and i have never even heard the term show choir  until about three hours ago  when my boss told me he had tickets to nascar  and i had to fill in at this fool event  those jane addams girls  ill be damned  if i didnt apportion hundreds of thousands  of taxpayers dollars to that school  so they can parade their behinds around like a bunch  of hoochie hos  the mckinley group was good but didnt seem all that rehearsed  but i liked their energy  well i have to admit i have a soft spot  for the rolling stones  i was at altamont speedway in 69  i actually saw that guy get stabbed  cant get that image out of my noggin  to this day  i seriously dont know  what either one of you are talking about  i have never been so bored  i mean  if i had to pick a group that i hated the least  it doesnt sound good guys  hey  um  i just wanted to say how great you all were  and i thought you were amazing  we have nothing to say to you  because we cheated i know  i feel terrible about it  but im going to tell the judges right now  that we dont deserve to win  and your email addresses  you guys were so much fun to watch  you should be very proud  get me the hell out of here

i hope it works out for you  im taking responsibility will  i mean im weak and im selfish  and i let my anxiety rule my life  but you know i wasnt always that way  its just that i wanted so many things  that i know were never going to have  but that was okay as long as i still had you  say something  im looking at you  and im trying  i mean i really want to feel that thing  i always felt when i looked at you before  that feeling of family  of love  but its gone  forever  i dont know       hey  nice ice sculpture  wheres ken  um home  id imagine  probably trying to regain some of the pride  that i stole from him  he dumped me  what  he said moving the wedding for sectionals was the last straw  but i thought he understood  thatthat you were doing this for the kids  he understand that  i wasnt doing it for the kids  i was doing it for you  emma  im so sorry  no gosh no its not your fault  ii really messed up  he was absolutely right  i was settling for him  really one blink from you
