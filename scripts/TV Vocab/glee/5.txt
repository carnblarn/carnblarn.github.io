                heres what happened last week quinn told finn   im pregnant  but she didnt tell him that hes not the father  puck is  whats up milf  can you believe that  wow  but thats not the only baby drama terri says shes pregnant but really shes faking  and mr schuester doesnt know  oh my god  also rachel quit the glee club because sue got sandy  to come back to direct a musical  and thats what you missed on glee   a singer in a smoky room    the smell of wine and cheap perfume    for a smile they can share the night    it goes on and on and on and on   quinn you ok  i think she just had a bad breakfast burrito  can we please talk about the giant elephant in the room  your sexuality   rachel we cant do it without her  thats not true  we may have to layer santana mercedes  over quinns solo but well be fine  maybe for the invitationals but not for the sectionals  and certainly not the regionals  the wheelchair kids right  that rachel chick wants me wanna light myself on fire but she can sing  rachel left guys shes gone  if we want to make this thing work we cant look back  alright take five minutes  mr shue  i dont want to tell you how to do your job but  with all the dancing around that quinns doing  im kind of worried about the baby  yeah  yeah i get it  um  how about i give tina a few of her verses okay  okay  you think you might want to  tell your mom about whats going on  i think id rather handle it myself right now  my moms got enough to worry about  how come you havent had any morning sickness  quinn fabray has been upchucking every 15 minutes  really  thats a really good sign  that means the babys not a mongoloid  well is it bad that you havent been sick then  oh no honey no no  you should ask howard bamboo  about my linda blair impersonations  every half hour at work  i dont know what im gonna do about this whole rachel thing  hey would you like anything else  another piece of grasshopper pie  what are you going for the record  im with child  hey did you go to mckinley high  i think i had you in my spanish class  yeah like five years ago  i go to carmel now  how is that possible  you must be 22  twentyfour  im a sixthyear senior  they keep failing me so i can stay in vocal adrenaline  they fail you on purpose  yeah is that legal  im the only one who can do the triple flip  yeah hey how about that other piece of pie  how about it  honey are you all right  yeah  fine   bell ringing  so have i done something wrong or  oh no no no absolutely not  no um actually  ive just um taken a special interest in you  look i know sometimes that life can come at you pretty fast  and uh you reach a point  where you might just need a little um  special guidance  has someone told you something about my personal life  no mmmm  can you keep a secret  but you know there are very few students  that ever get athletic scholarships  okay but there are a lot of schools that give full rides  to students who excel in music  students like yourself  and i dont know maybe if you were able to go to college  you wouldnt say end up stuck in this town  in a deadend job living hand tomouth with a wife and a kid  you never intended to have you know  for example  thats just something off the top of my head  so you think if i stuck with glee  that i could get a scholarship  its definitely a possibility  you know and if you did well at regionals  maybe you could um generate some interest  but we lost rachel  do you think we can do it without her  sure  bell rings  do you think we can win regionals without rachel  well remember the jamaican bobsled team  big long shots  definitely  but if youre concerned about your future  and um those who may be a part of your future soon  um maybe you could just give rachel a talk  you know see if you can get her to come back  bell rings  how does it feel to be just a sophomore  and get the lead in the school musical  its an honor  frankly one i feel ive earned  if theres anything ive learned in my 16 years on the stage  its that stars are rare  and when theyre found you have to let them shine  recorder clicks off  show me your bra  you mean the one im wearing  quid pro quo rachel  if you want a good review  show me your over the shoulder boulder holder  no way you cant do that  my performance will stand on its own  besides no one reads the school paper anyway  oh but

huffed a lot of upholstery cleaner in the 90s  look april  ive been uh talking to the glee kids  and um i think theyre still  not so sure about having you around  you draw a lot of attention to yourself  and theyre embarrassed enough as it is  so do you think you could maybe  take some time and try to win them over  you make my dreams by hall  oates playing  yeah  mm smells like my aunt mildred  just drink it   what i want   sweet  with a bit of an afterburny taste  oh good chablis should always have a little bite  now a few swigs of that every day before school  and youll have all

lit  are you sure  she can stay  tttotally   you make my dreams come true    oohooh   laughs  dont tickle me  laughs  piano playing cabaret   what good is sitting    alone in your room   this is

know what i dont want  and it is all of this  when i gave you this part i thought you could handle it  but clearly you cant  what this show needs  is a star with a little bit more maturity  i know what youre trying to do  youre trying to get me to quit so you can be the star  well it wont work  im not going anywhere  ill say  im sleeping with him so am i  this plays weird  thats mr ryersons favorite line  youre a really good actor finn  maybe you should consider joining the musical  im pretty devoted to glee  i dont think i could just walk away from it  i know how hard it was for you  but i could justify doing both  if you came back  but we both know thats not gonna happen  do you know what we should do  elope what  nothing  we should go bowling  youre always so stressed out about the play  you just need to loosen up  i always go bowling whenever im worked up  about a big game or something  just us  yeah  yeah thatthatthat would be great  ii am really stressed out  but thats the price you pay for being a star  april dont i know it  will heyachel  april rhodes rachel berry  hey can you give us the room rachel  we need to teach april the cues for dont stop believing  wait shes singing the female lead  wait shes in the glee club  shes ancient  talent doesnt age sweetheart  thats rachels part mr shue  well rachels not in the glee club anymore  thanks finn  rachel  were

gasps  hey em just trying to figure out the set list  for saturday  i just got back from the emergency room  had them give me four decontamination showers  i think they call that the full silkwood  what happened  kurt was drunk and he ralphed on me  not really fessing up to how he got the booze just yet  but im pretty sure its not a fake id  because he looks like an 11yearold milkmaid  will i think it was april  her backpacks always clinking with empties  im so sorry  ii will ill talk to him  okay  im um  im a little bit worried  about the glee club  so am i  i mean sighs  if we dont place at regionals itits all over  we have obligations as teachers will  to give kids opportunities for growth  and enrichment  with april in glee  youre taking away a kids chance to grow  and youre giving it to someone  whose brain is soaked in corn booze  aprils not finished emma  and if glees gonna win i need to give her a second chance  she is a talented performer  and i really think that the kids are going to learn  a lot of valuable technique from her  okay  but i think you need to think about  why youre doing this  and what youre willing to sacrifice to get it  slow distorted you  suck  sobbing  sympathetically oh  rough day at the office cookie  ive just got a lot on my plate  its not easy being in the spotlight  its the difficult road ive chosen  yeah  i know that song sister  um do you have any nyquil  i could use a little pickmeup  no  these high school boys are a lot hotter than they used to be  that finn hudson is one cutie pie i gots my eye on  finns taken april  yeah well some guys like  a little somethinsomethin on the side  i think your behavior is totally inappropriate  and your presence in this school is a complete travesty  what you choose to do with your life is your own business  but dont go around screwing up everyone elses  im not afraid of you sweetie  there was a time when i was the biggest star around here  and now that ive got that back  im never letting it go  do i have to put my fingers in the holes  couldnt there be diseases in there or something  oh no ball sharings all part of the fun  here use the pink one  pinks your favorite

that dont cost too much or come in a pill   april  i brought you here because i need to talk to you  okay  im concerned that youre a bad influence on the glee club  i cant have you around if youre going to continue  to encourage them to make bad choices   one that makes me feel like i feel when im with you   well youre right will  as of right now im back on the wagon  really  thats great laughing  laughing  i have to tell you something  i was in awe of you in high school  i mean of all the roads i never traveled in my life  the one i regret the most was never  getting the chance to sing with you  really  yeah i mean thats how you get better you know  singing with people who are better than you  you really thought that much of me  april  you are the reason i joined glee club  no

look i need to get a music scholarship  so i can go to college  so i can get a good job so i can take care of my kid  and i cant do that if you dont come back to glee club  you should take it as a compliment  you could have just been honest with me  look i know what i did was wrong  i get that but that kiss was real  whatever it was it ruined any chance  of me ever coming back to glee  i hope
