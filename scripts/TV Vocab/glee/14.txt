dont understand  we won sectionals  i completely demonstrated the validity of this program  now youre saying we have  to place at regionals or the glee clubs gone  shue that was the deal from the beginning  i still have a bottom line  those spotlights in the auditorium  dont run on dreams  our electricity consumption is up two percent  besides its cold out  shue and the cheerios  can no longer

guess chicks dig me  but i guess if im being honest  its more like im not over her  im not breaking up with you  im just saying please stop supersizing  cause i dont dig on fat chicks  im pregnant  and thats my fault   and rachel  now that were sort of dating i have to work  so much harder to pretend to be listening to her  that sounds great  sometimes i wish i could be more like coach tanaka

back on it   and toyota moving forward  there  you no longer confuse me with your shemale looks  im going to donate this to the victims of hurricane katrina  they can use it to plug the holes in their

appropriate greeting  look i am really proud of what you guys did at sectionals  but as most of you have realized by now  it hasnt made a bit of difference  in your daytoday at school  i have a slushe estained training bra to prove it  the fact is were gonna have to be better  even more spectacular at regionals  its time for some reinvention  some new new directions  we need a new  hello  heres

you  ill see you later  you two should be wetting yourselves with shame  glee club won sectionals and you did nothing to stop it  if you were samurai  and my letter opener were sharp enough  i would ask you both right now  to commit seppuku  in japanese this means ritual bellyslitting  we were seduced by the glitz and glamour of show biz  let me drop some knowledge on you  ever since quinn fabray got knocked up  ive been in the market for a new head cheerleader  if you want the job and back in my good graces  youre gonna have to turn around  and listen up  youre familiar with a little glee clubber named rachel berry  rachels the kind of girl  who wants things too badly  and what she really wants is one finn hudson  i want you to go after him  shell go crazy  she wont be able to stand your dating him  humiliated shamed  shell have no choice but to leave the group  and without her  schuester wont make it to regionals  i know its been hard on you  since the baby drama  trust me i get it and it sucks  you seem to be handling it fine  well its because i realized that  i had to find this new person inside of me  the one that was okay with what happened  i just feel so bad about myself  finn that guy who made all those bad choices  who ignored the signs hes gone  this new more experienced more interesting guy is here  and i brought you here to introduce you to him  help you move forward  oh you mean like meeting other girls  because i think im dating rachel  at least she sure thinks i am  no its not about meeting someone else  its about being okay just being you  come on youre a rock star finn  youre like jagger morrison  yeah yeah i like that  good i want you to meet  the new and improved finn hudson  by singing about it  oh thats why the bands here  yeah pick a song and theyre ready to back you up  well i like what you said about me being like morrison  and the doors have a hello song  so maybe i could find myself  and do my glee assignment at the same time  all right man go to work  and that fellow glee clubbers is how we say hello  mr schuester  id like to run some of my hello ideas by you  youre a really good dancer  thanks but my feet werent really moving  that was the best part  oh  brit and i were wondering if you wanted to go out  on a date  with which one of you   with both of us  with both of us  breadstix 800  table for three  cool  what did they want  oh nothing  just the time  i know being my boyfriend is a challenge  im not quinn  i dont look like her  im not popular and my personality  though exciting and full of surprises  isnt exactly lo wmaintenance but  ill always be honest with you  painfully so  and all i ask in return  is that youre just honest with me  i dont think i want to be your boyfriend  what  look rachel youre really awesome  but i think i need to connect with my inner rock star  before i can fully commit to one woman  i need to find out who i am now  ill tell you who you are  youre a scared little boy  youre afraid of dating me  because you think it might hurt your reputation  though which youd never admit it  is very important to you  you hate what quinn did to you  not just because it hurt  but because it was so humiliating  youre freaking me out  its like youre inside my head right now  i just see you for who you are  unlike you who can only see me as this silly girl  who made a fool out of herself  in her first glee club rehearsal  and thats where you lose finn  because if you take a second look at me  youd realize that im the only person in your life  who knows you and accepts you for who you are no matter what  well obviously hawaiian pizzas the best  because its got ham and pineapple on it right  true mmhmm  so its better than most pizzas because it has  all right guys you got to get moving  on those hello numbers  who has got something to show us  volunteers  mr schuester i think i found a song  that sums up my feelings perfectly  fantastic rachel  show us what you got  guys guys guys  i dont want to be a buzzkill  but the assignment was hello  im sorry i was just focusing on the first syllable  you know what  i dont think you guys understand  the seriousness of what were up against  while we were busy winning our sectional  vocal adrenaline was busy winning theirs  theyre last years national champions  they havent lost a competition in three years  this is the big leagues guys  if we dont place at regionals glee club is over  lionel richie huh  one of my favorites  oh my god youre jessie st james  youre in vocal adrenaline  and youre rachel berry  i saw you perform at sectionals  your rendition of dont rain on my parade was flawed  you totally lacked barbras emotional depth  but youre talented  this is one of my favorite haunts  i like to come and flip through the celebrity biographies  pick up some lifestyle tips  im a senior now so this years kind of my victory lap  snagging a fourth consecutive national championship  would just be gravy  im getting out of ohio soon  ive got a full ride to a little school  called the university of california los angeles  maybe youve heard of it  its in los angeles  what do you say we take it for a spin  here  oh no iiim kind of nervous  i remember when i used to get nervous  come on i do this all the time  i like to give impromptu concerts for the homeless  its so important to give back  we should do this more often  hows friday night  excuse me  wed like to send these back  but you ate all of it  look im pretty sure you have to do what we say  and this food  was not satisfactory  there was a mouse in mine  so wed like more please  all right hottest guys in the school  go  okay um pucks superfine  mmhmm finns cute too  yeah but hes not hot though  he really isnt  and you know what brit  i think that dwarf girlfriend of his  is dragging down his rep  i mean if he were dating  say popular pretty girls like us  he would go from dumpy to smokin  hello  hey im right here  would you guys mind  like including me in your conversations  ill just give you an introduction  into the way that we work  you buy us dinner and we make out in front of you  its like the best deal ever  did you see what rachel was wearing today  i know  she looked like pippi longstocking  but like israeli  those sweaters make her look homeschooled  hey guys come on dont make fun of rachel  shes shes kind of cool  finn thats mean  you know what actually would you mind  waiting in the car  and leave your credit card  did you know that dolphins are just gay sharks  yeah  neil diamond  this is the perfect song for us  see hes known this girl for so long  but theyve just been friends  and now hes calling her up to tell her he wants more  i was sort of inspired  by my hello assignment with the kids  well i love it  yeah i love it  you do  oh  i dont know why but  i always had a soft spot for this song  too much too fast too much too fast  you smell great your teeth are clean  youre very sweet its not that im  i just havent been uh intimate  in a very very long time  how long  ever  i just havent found the right person  you know someone who wont reject me  when things get really hard with my um with my problems  itits cool  its not  its not cool i can tell  no no no  emma  i understand  ill pop in a movie  do we have to watch armageddon again  uh its that or bad boys  theyre the only dvds that terri left behind  she liked to have bruckheimer night every other week  okay okay  hey rach can we talk  look i want to apologize  i realized i dont want to date other girls  only you  you do talk too much  and usually youre just talking about yourself  but at least i dont feel alone when im with you  im glad youve come to that realization  but youre too late  ive met someone else  a boy whos finally worthy of my talent and love  whoa whoa wait  do i know him  is he is he bigger than me  oh he doesnt go to this school and hes a senior  his name is jessie and hes the male lead in vocal adrenaline  were both aware that our rome oandjuliet romance  will be a challenge but our deep respect  for each others talent will carry us through  rachel dont you think thats kind of suspicious  we make it to regionals and suddenly  the top guy in our main competition picks you up  i know its hard to believe that anyone would like me  without an ulterior motive but you have to respect  that our love is real  move on finn  i finally have  mr shue we have a problem  finn didnt fall for any of our tricks  such as i didnt wear a bra  and i had them turn up the air conditioning  ladies i misjudged you  you may be two of the stupidest teens ive ever encountered  and thats saying something  i once taught a cheerleading seminar to a young sarah palin  wait we did find out  rachels with some dude from vocal adrenaline  name  jessie st james  ooh bringing down this club may be easier than i thought  im engorged with venom and triumph  now get the hell out of my office  stop please dear god just stop  seriously guys  its like watching beige paint dry  could everyone please look at jessie  jessie give us a show face  thats a show face guys  you want to look so talented  its literally hurting you  i want a look thats so optimistic  it could cure cancer  thats what im talking about  take five everybody drink a red bull  excuse me ms corcoran  hi im will schuester  sorry i dont know who you are  im a big fan really  i also coach the mckinley glee club  i dont usually cotton too well  to my competition sneaking in to watch a rehearsal  but i also have trouble seeing you guys as competition  i believe you have a student named jessie st james  yeah i think he might be dating one of my students  im more than a little concerned  with the whole fraternizing with the enemy aspect  of their relationship  you think were spying on you  honestly  yes  noted  look i dont stand  for any funny business and jessies a good kid  i mean what can you do  the heart wants what the heart wants  sometimes theres that little spark  im not interested in coaching  just your average high school glee club  im driven to excellence  yeah excellence  a lot of people thought i couldnt take nationals  with a routine where the kids dance entirely on their hands  okay im sorry  we have to stop  i  i just cant do this  aw im sorry  im all business im trying to work on that  no it isnt that  are you gay  what  no  because most of the show choir directors  i make out with are gay  i spend every waking moment  thinking about vocal adrenaline  i have no life  i havent been on a date in three years  here you go  thanks  i did lie to you earlier  i do know who you are  i saw you at our fall invitational  i thought you were really cute  you know i know what you mean about being obsessed with work  im so committed to the glee club  and i think it played a big part in ending my marriage  how long have you been divorced  um well im not really divorced yet  and then ii started dating  someone ii really care about  but it isnt working for some reason  oh youre already seeing someone else  and you were just making out with me  im kind of a mess  look i dont want to tell you how to live your life  please be my guest  i think you need to take some time  to reintroduce yourself to yourself  you just finished being somebodys husband  and that didnt really work out  and now youre running off to be  somebodys boyfriend  seems to me you need to take a little breather  look  that hair that dimple  that terrible clunker you drive  i think youre about the cutest thing ive ever seen  heres my number  when you get things sorted out give me a call  thank you for the coffee  and the making out kind of hot  hey guys  cut the butter benedict arnold  we heard about your new boyfriend  look rachel  were all happy that youre happy  but weve worked too hard in glee club  to let you throw it all away on a relationship  that might not even be real  why cause hes in vocal adrenaline  their motto is  aut neca aut necatus eris  which loosely translates to  murder or be murdered  they give their dancers human growth hormone  look were not saying  the dude is playing you hes playing you  we just think that until regionals are over  we cant risk the possibility that he is  none of us want to go through  what happened at sectionals again  okay look jessie and i might not be true love  but what if we are  i know who i am  and how many chances at this am i going to get  if you dont break up with him youre out  you cant kick me out  but we can all quit if mr shue doesnt  well good luck winning without me  everyone is replaceable even you  how could you do this to me  how could you do this to us  were a team and  all youve ever wanted was for us to be great  and be a part of something special  now is that still true or not  you wanted to see me coach sylvester  i did rachel  i want to introduce you  to the mckinley high old maids club  have a seat  boy hips  i dont understand  well rachel its come to my attention  that youve been given the old heaveho  by that terribly uncoordinated finn hudson  ouch and i also understand  you have a serious suitor in the form a piping hot  hunkwad from another district  but that your fellow  glee clubbers are so incensed with betrayal  they barely have time to apply freeze off  to the clusters of warts between their knuckles  how did you know that  brit and i told everybody in glee club  about jessie st james  theyre furious  if rachel falls for him the club will selfdestruct  outstanding on to step two  round up a bunch of mustach esporting teenage girls  with glandular conditions  anything else  sometimes i forget my middle name  i know how torn you must be berry  my freshman year  i fell for a boy on an opposing wrestling squad  but my team wouldnt go for it  so the next time i stepped onto the mat  i pinned him so hard it ruptured his scrotum  ending his run for  the state championship  and my run for his heart  to my team  i was a legend  but i relished this victory in solitude  now  i spend my friday nights  making out with my cat  and watching ghost whisperer  well rachel  if i werent ignoring  what these ladies were saying  out of an overwhelming sense of deep repulsion  i would probably hear them encouraging you  to go for it with your carmel high beau  or you might end up like  dottie here who although her father offered  a sizeable dowry which included livestock  still couldnt get a date to homecoming  no homecoming  no valentines no sock hop  rachel you need to become even more narcissistic  and selfcentered than you already are  think of yourself your potential happiness  if not  join the club  beautiful table  meticulous really  i guess being crazy has its benefits  its date night  actually it was tomorrow  but will wanted tonight so im surprising him  and i know  he keeps a key under the mat  youre really loving this arent you  i take no pleasure in your pain terri  but i am enjoying  seeing will get a second chance at happiness yes  oh and youre the one to introduce him  to this magical new world of bliss  what you with your thre etimesaday showers  and the fact that you cant sleep  unless your shoes are all in a row  is there a reason that youre here  cause id kind of like you to be gone when will gets home  i just need to pick up the rest of my bruckheimer dvds  whose is this  thats mine  i got really tired of watching con air every night  and will picked hello as our song  oh you poor girl  dont bother sleeping with my husband tonight  youre already screwed  hello was our prom song  i mean i doubt will remembers  he goes to the market for milk comes home with a pack of gum  youre lying  ask him  or better yet go to the library  and look it up for yourself in that years thunderclap  sorry  jessie  whos there  i carry a rape whistle  just me  most spots are 2500 watts  this one is ten times brighter  we have to wear sunscreen onstage but its worth it  i guess everything is bigger and brighter here  i have to ask you something  and i need you to tell me the truth  because if you dont there will be consequences  lifeanddeath consequences  because if i give myself to you  and it turns out that youre just playing me  i might die  okay okay not literally but emotionally  itll be the kind of heartbreak that girls like me hold  for the rest of their lives like barbra in the way we were  oh my god  what  youre more of a drama queen than i am  hi  im jessie  i know who you are  you know jessie st james  the star of vocal adrenaline your competition at regionals  i want to introduce you to jessie  the guy whos nuts about you  the guy who would never hurt you   no one can know  i understand  hi  hey  i get home last night and  it was like some ghost had laid out  this beautiful romantic meal for me  a ghost who wears your perfume  i was just in the library  page 42  okay  oh my my junior prom  i wanted to surprise you on wednesday  terri came by and um  told me about the prom about the song  emma ii have no feelings about this night anymore  i didnt even remember the song  no i know i know not consciously  but somewhere inside  youre still not over her  we were naive  i think sometimes we spend  so much time with these kids that we start acting like them  youve been in the same relationship  your entire life  you dont know who you are alone  i think this song is just  the beginning of you repeating the same patterns  terri and i met when i was 15  im a different person now  how is you compromising yourself  for my crazy any different than you doing it for hers  well what do you want to do  i think that  you need to spend some time alone  i do i think you need to get to know yourself  you know you havent been okay  with having your own needs since you were 15  youre right  i guess  im just not good at being alone  and realizing what my own needs are  well maybe around the time that you figure out what they are  maybe ill be ready to get a little messy  can you go now  i think i need to close the door and cry  hey  i ended it with jessie  you can spread the word  i know you know how to do that  look im sorry uh  look i know this really sucks for you  but i think its for the best  taking one for the team i get it  no not just for the team  for us  you and me  ive been thinking a lot lately  i feel like i have  all these problems you know  with quinn andand basketball and girls and stuff  and ive been so overwhelmed  trying to figure them all out  then i realized the only thing i needed to fix was us  i want us to be together rachel  a real couple  look i even circled some dates on your crazy calendar  is you not being able to talk right now  a good thing or a bad thing  i cant cant what  ii cant be a couple with you  its the team  wewe cant have any um drama right now  you know we need we need to focus on regionals  and i appreciate your offer  but in the spirit of being a team player  i have to decline  hey whoa  im not just some guy that you met at the music store  that you can just blow off  i dont give up that easy  see you at rehearsal
