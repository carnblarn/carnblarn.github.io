cover  canaries dont like cold weather  especially pavarotti  so what did you think of the song  can i be really honest with you  because it comes from a place of caring  been there done that  look youre amazing blaine  your solos are breathtaking  theyre also numerous  kurt the council decides who gets the solos  do i detect a little jealousy  no you detect a lot of jealousy  look blaine  sometimes i dont feel like were the warblers  i feel like were blaine and the pips  bell tolls  corrected by icephoenix  school bell ringing  okay so i really took all of your notes  from my headband to heart  and i i really tapped into my pain  for this second song  so come and sit down  these are for you just in case  its pretty emotional  dont be afraid if you need to  hit it  playing ballad  youve got just one egg   youre not going to make an omelet   flying just one way   youre not going to make a jet set   sister brother wherefore art thou   no need for bunk beds in my bedroom now   oh

only child  yeah i got that uh  its better than my headband thats for sure  but it  it still feels like youre just playing scared  youre only dealing with the easy pain  you got to get to the hard stuff  thats whats relatable to everybody  i im perfectly capable of accessing my pain   i cry every time i sing a solo  exactly  when you sing i can feel it  i guess you just got to go  inside yourself to wherever the singing comes from  and write from there  have you even ever tried to write a song  quinn sometimes i worry about finn  i mean how damaged  does a guy have to be to be into someone  as annoying as rachel  still he is a good guy  and i do really like him  hes my first love  and first loves are forever  and another thing  without him im never going to get one of these  i know what youre thinking  prom queen  youre smart and super pretty  and relatively sane for a girl  does being prom queen really matter to you  well it does  prom queens live on average  five years longer than regular people  its probably because they smile a lot  and smiling has been proven to ward off diseases  but i cant do it without finn  hes a shooin for prom king  and after winning the big game  hell help me land crucial swing votes  amazingly the only person standing in my way  is her and her damn talent  if im going to guarantee that he doesnt stray with her  im going to have to play it right  they say keep your friends close  but your enemies closer  well rachel berry  you just got yourself a new best friend  kurt whistling pavarotti singing  whistling continues singing stops  pavarotti  boys clamoring angrily warblers warblers i am merely suggesting  that instead of wearing blue ties with red piping  we wear jackets with red ties  and blue piping for the competition  this is a kangaroo court  conversation stops  kurt whats wrong  its pavarotti  pavarotti is dead  i suspect a stroke  oh my god im so sorry  i know its really stupid to be upset about a bird but  he he inspired me with his optimism  and his love of song  he was my friend  now i know today we need to practice doowopping  behind blaine while he sings every solo  in the medley of pnk songs  but id like to sing a song for pavarotti today  blackbird begins  blackbird singing in the dead of night   take these broken wings and learn to fly   all your life   you were only waiting for this moment to arise   warblers gently vocalizing  blackbird singing in the dead of night   take these sunken eyes and learn to see   all your life   you were only waiting for this moment to be free   blackbird fly

for this moment to arise   ooh   sobbing thank you  bell ringing guys ive got some bad news  you know how we decided on sing  by my chemical romance for regionals  well i hold in my hand a cease and desist letter from the band  we cant do it  it was the perfect anthem  how much do you want to bet  coach sylvester has something to do with this  one step ahead of you  do you know anything about this sue  i do now i met the drummer  from my chemical romance at a drum circle at daytona beach  spring break 1996  we had a brief affair  and when i heard of your song choice for regionals  well i was compelled to notify the band  about your longrunning legal battle with peta  that is not true  you took away my cheerios  consider this the opening salvo of world war sue  so what are we going to do now  i think we should write original songs for regionals  santana all those in favor of voting rachel down a second time  no i think rachel is right  this team works best when we push ourselves  and do something a little different  thats true but if all the other teams are doing amazing songs  were not going to be so good  quinn youre right were not going to be as good  were going to be better  we wont be using other peoples words or music  itll be our own  our own heart soul not just our voices  we have a really talented songwriter  in our midst rachel  i was thinking maybe you and i could write a song together  im with quinn and rachel  i mean if these two can agree on something  its probably an idea worth considering  wait wait so suddenly  you two are writing the music for regionals no way  i think that everyone should get a chance to write a song  santanas right we can do this  what do you think mr shue  i think were doing original songs for regionals  school bell ringing hey  can i ask you a question  we used to be really close and i really miss being your friend  still waiting for the question   did i do something wrong  no look i dont know  did you  all i know is you blew me off  to be with stumbles mccripplepants  thats fine  its your loss  cause now i get the chance to write  an awesome heterosexual song about sam  that were going to sing at regionals  wait youre still dating sam  but you told me you were in love with me  i honestly dont know what i was thinking  look can you stop staring at me  i cant remember my locker combo  well well  if it isnt tweedledumb and tweedlefakeboobs  you know you cant talk to us like that  youre not our cheer coach anymore  im not anybodys cheerleading coach anymore  you betrayed me and in case you havent heard  i like to play dirty  both screaming  coughing  i dont even remember putting that in there  bell ringing brittany groans  you know i think blaines version  of the song is actually better than the original  but its not in his natural key so   how dare you  enough im tired of this  i agree i think we should just  let you pick the song that you want to sing  no im tired of the warblers being all about me  david please make sure everything  im about to say goes down in the official minutes  we are going to lose at regionals   what  i am incredibly grateful  for the belief youve all given me as a junior member  to lead you all in these wonderful songs this year  but from what kurt has told me about new directions  i just know i cant beat them on my own  which is why i propose that we rearrange  our 1100 number and turn it into a duet  loud grumbling  to showcase other talent in this group  why dont we just play it on kazoos  point of order point of order  now we all lost one of our own this week  pavarottis voice was silenced by death  and i dont want to silence anyone elses voices in this group  i think pavarotti would roll over  in his tiny tiny little grave  the placement of which has yet to be determined  all right a vote  whos in favor of warbler blaines proposal  for a dual lead at regionals  oh can i put my name on the audition list  no  no auditions  i want to sing the duet with kurt  thats ridiculous  i mean there are so many great voices  i mean everyone deserves a shot at that honor  all in favor of kurt being my duet partner at regionals  decided  congratulations kurt  boy congratulations applause  school bell ringing  all right guys lets hear it for our first songwriting seminar  cheers and applause  while quinn and rachel are hard at work  were gonna try to write an anthem of our own  now these are rhyming dictionaries for all of you  mr shue  tina and i have been already working on a song that i wrote  really thats amazing  well can we hear it  cheering  this is a song that i wrote for sam  its called trouty mouth   wait whats it called  trouty mouth  soft bluesy ballad begins  guppy face   trouty mouth   is that how peoples lips look   where you come from in the south   grouper mouth   froggy lips   i love sucking on those salamander lips   want to put a fish hook in those lips so cherry red   if you tried hard enough   you could suck a babys head   whoo   okay can we stop   stop with the mouth jokes  sit down im not finished  yes you are mr shue were not doing a song at regionals   called trouty mouth  you know what  i have to agree with sam on this one  but such a good first effort  i just dont think its got the um  epic feel we need for regionals  mr shue i wrote a song too  i wrote it for lauren  i know that when i sang fatbottomed girls  it might have hurt her feelings a little bit  but i think this makes up for it  its got a bit of a rockabilly feel  so it could give us an edge this weekend  all right show us what you got  its called big ass heart  chuckles  rock rhythm begins  my girl went to the doctor   cause her heart had palpitations   said cut the carbs or else shed end up   pushin up carnations   she stepped up on the scale   and the doctor said oh lordy   if you dont drop a few girl   you wont make it past age forty   my girl said hey looky on that fancy x ray chart   said the doctor holy hell   thats one gd bigass heart   im tellin you my friend   my girls got a bigass heart   when she shops for groceries   that heart gets its own damn cart   that bigass heart can pump two tons   of love through her chest   and then sit down and win a lovin pieeating contest   i love that bigass heart so much i think it isnt fair   like how your heart wont pay me back   for breaking all my chairs   so sick with love   i think im coming down with rickets   when that bigass heart flies coach   it has to pay for two plane tickets   oh that bigass heart   oh that bigass heart   song ends

king and queen  its the ultimate status symbol  so after regionals well go public  with our relationship and start the campaign  i dont think thats a good idea  why  because of rachel  shes really

 for a nun im pretty liberal  but im barely a nun  in fact i just joined because i needed a place to live  bless you  the convent is the one place i knew i could stay off the pole  but my question is this  that dalton academy is it a gay school  or is it just a school that appears gay  could i add a dash of rod to this lady soup  my hairdresser is a gay  and for fifteen years hes been with his partner  also a hairdresser  i see no reason why they shouldnt be allowed to marry  and raise a family of beautiful wigs  i liked the duet the two boys from dalton sang  oh boys shouldnt do a duet  the last thing we need to do is send a message  to children that gay is okay  it is not a legitimate lifestyle  and last time i checked its not in the constitution   what about that song about jesus  well that should win  uh uh uh no no no no  now that is just cheap pandering  i didnt even like to be pandered to when i was a stripper  those new directions had it going on   those songs were fresh  those songs were terrible  i am sorry but im a politician  and when i lost my last election  and there will be a recount i didnt go around singing  about being a loser  i twittered that obama is a

that rises above  to help carry their teammates to victory the mvp  and i would like to start a tradition of honoring that player  after every one of our competitions  so per a unanimous vote  by all of you our regionals mvp is  miss rachel berry  cheering  will come on up  yeah   congratulations  thank you   if i could just say a few words  sure  and here she goes making me regret voting for her  well first of all i just want to say  how amazing the song you guys wrote was  i i was so inspired  you know its its funny  ive won a lot of trophies before for singing competitions  and dancing competitions  but ive always felt like the girl  who never gets the brass ring  and maybe i never will  but today and at regionals  the way you guys believed in me  and took a chance with me  all ive ever wanted was to feel special  and to feel chosen and i just um  i wanted to thank you guys so much for giving me that  so thats all  others mvp cheering  corrected by icephoenix
