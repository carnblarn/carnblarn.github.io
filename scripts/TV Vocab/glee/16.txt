will was none too happy about  and thats what you missed on  glee   ladies what we have here is a gradea dilemma  mercedes your vocal chords  have had more fantastic runs than a kenyan track team  but

would rather die  before we allow them to become the next beyonc and jayz  and finns mothers romance with my father  is sending him into a wholly unnecessary tailspin of despair  what we all need right now  is to explore the idea of a sense of place  and how if we find that place within  we will get that happy ending  brad b flat   a chair is still a chair    even when theres no one sitting there    but a chair    is not a house    and a house is not a home    when theres no one there    to hold you tight    and no one there    you can    kiss good night    a room is still a room    even when theres nothing there but gloom    but a room is not a house    and a house is not a home    when the two of us    are far apart    and one of us has a broken heart    now and then i call your name    and suddenly your face appears    but its just a crazy game    and when it ends    it ends in tears    so darling have a heart    dont let one mistake keep us apart    well im not meant to
