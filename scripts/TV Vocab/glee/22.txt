                t know why anyone would miss an episode of glee  but heres whats been happening in case you did  quinns parents found out shes pregnant  so they kicked her out i needed my mom  mercedes so its decided  you move in with me  jessie dropped rachel and mckinley  and the new directions and hes back on vocal adrenaline  which freaked everybody out and convinced them they cant  beat them at regionals and if they dont place at regionals  the club is over which would be awful  and thats what you missed on glee  hey buddy see you on saturday  wait what  at regionals didnt you hear  im one of the judges  you cannot allow this to happen  its out of my hands william  i have no control over what  the show choir governing board says or does  let me break it down for you will  its been decided that this years regionals  will be judged by celebrities  and im a celebrity  now william  now i realize my cultural  ascendance only serves  to illuminate your own banality  but face it  im a legend its happened  do you have any idea how hard my kids have been working sue  i have to be honest will  im having a really difficult time hearing  anything you have to say today because  your hair looks like a briar patch  i keep expecting racist  animated disney characters to pop up  and start singing songs about living on the bayou  principal figgins i am begging you  do not let her do this to those kids  william i resent the implication  that i dont play by the rules  you leaked our set list at sectionals sue  i have no memory of that  i will not let you do this  we have worked ourselves to the bone to get where we are  im sorry will but our arrangement stands  you must win or place at regionals  or im disbanding the club  if i were you i would spend  less time complaining to me and more time  convincing judge sylvester here that your new directions  have got the goods  good luck with that will   i cant do this  yes you can  have another wine cooler  im president of the celibacy club  i took a vow  so did santana and brittany and i did them  what about finn  hes your best friend  come on were in high school  you think either one of us is going to give a damn  about finn in three years  lifes just a bunch of experiences you know  you dont get a medal at the finish line for being good  you just get dead  okay but you cant tell anybody  i cant lose my rep  our

its going to be over  please you think puck and santana  are going to even acknowledge  my existence once were not  in glee club together anymore  she has a point  mr schuester  do you think instead of nominating songs  we can just all go around the room  and talk about things that we loved about  glee club this year  will it took everything i had not to cry  its like theyve all walked a thousand miles  just to get punched in the stomach  what exactly are you looking for from me here  some guidance  do you remember when you were going  to quit teaching and become an accountant  and i showed you that video of yourself singing at nationals  and you said that that was the happiest moment of your life  do you remember why  because i loved what i was doing  and isnt that what youve been drilling  into their heads all year  that that feeling is way more important  than winning or losing  i miss you  im seeing someone  what  hishis names carl  carl howell  hes my dentist  hes always been very impressed with my oral hygiene  and the last time i was there he was showing me  the machines that they use to sterilize their tools  and he asked me out  weve been going out every night

chance of keeping it together  at mr shues until you decided to bail  youre our leader rachel  the way youre on everyone all the time is annoying but  its also what keeps the club motivated  you and i

five of you in here  and we sucked  i mean we really sucked  bad  one day all of you are going to be gone  and all of this all of us  will be nothing but a hazy memory  it will take you a second to

middle  and i love you guys too much  to let you not make the most of it  now i was going to quit once  but you guys brought me back with  dont stop believing  it was a nine  but we are going to make

teach me  so much only you can teach me  oh rachel i cant do this anymore  im tired of coaching glee club  i want a life  it took meeting you to realize  all the stuff that i missed out on  i need some balance you know  i need a house and a garden  and a dog a f  family  i missed out on my chance with you  and it kills me  and i cant let that happen again  wheres the rest of your team  theyre uh theyre at the hospital  quinn had her baby is she okay  yeah shes fine  it was um  its a beautiful baby girl  newtonjohn youre dead to me  remington horsey have a seat and listen up  i dont care who comes in first  i dont care who places send but i have  a very strong opinion about who comes in third  sue if i may  that bohemian rhapsody  had me amovin and ashakin and im talking old school  you know i partied with freddy mercury back in the 70s  and i partied hard if you know what i mean  back then people werent so obsessed with labels  i for one was offended  that only one of the groups chose to honor me in song  i think aural intensity should win  yes  two questions one are you single  and two how about those new directions  i liked them i thought they had a lot of heart  heart oh please  talk about blatant tokenism  that whole were inspiring were a ragtag  bunch of misfits thing is so 2009  i couldnt agree more lets vote  the production values simply werent there  couldnt they afford better costumes  are they a poor person school  groban i thought that brunette had an amazing voice  brunettes have no place  in show business  oh come on theyre just kids  thats no excuse by the time i was 14  id already formed a band  when josh groban was their age  he was already in the mickey mouse club or something  as the only educator here let me point out  that not all kids are afforded  the same opportunities as others  is that what you tell yourself to get to sleep at night  some people just simply dont have talent  you think youre a celebrity youre not  you just try hard thats about it  olivia newtonjohn has a valid point here  you have a lot in common  with those kids at your school sue  underachievers with delusions of grandeur  dagnabbit  now even i have to admit im a little confused  as to what sue is doing in this room  wasnt the theme tonight supposed to be celebrity judges  kiss my ass josh groban  i am a internationall yranked cheerleading coach  who lives in ohio when this is done  today josh and i are flying back to la first class  youll be staying here  just like those kids  i think weve all made up our minds  lets vote  thank you all for coming  as you all know glee club  is such an important  and i honestly cant even finish that sentence  so lets just get to it  the 2010 midwest regional runnersup  from fort wayne indiana  the notatall stupidlynamed  aural intensity  sue very good  mmhmm  and now  your 2010 midwest regional show choir champions  vocal adrenaline  we didnt even place  love she looks like you  do you want to keep her  no  do you  did you love me  yes  especially now  which one is yours  what are you doing here  i see her now  she looks like you  does she have a name  no  beth  pretty  i like that name  how do you even call yourself a principal  okay this is this is it this is not  emma  emma what was that about its so unfair  will your kids have worked so hard for this  did you know hes already given your choir room to the mock un  a deals a deal we lost emma  because sue cheated  she cheated will and where do you think  all that moneys going its going right  into her pockets we just  we cant let her win this one  how can you just stand there and be so calm about this  how can you just give up so easily  ive tried emma  okay it  itits over  no no its never over  i dont care what anybody says  some things are worth fighting for  you mean like the kids yes of course  anything else no  no this is about the glee club this is not about us  the hell it is  i love you emma  there i finally said it  and you love me and dentist or no  this thing isnt over between us  rachel mr schuester  yeah  can you please come to the auditorium  sure  so we have something we need to say to you  in the beginning of this year  i was just another football player  i had a stutter  i was a closeted diva  i used to be captain of the cheerios  i was afraid to dance outside my room  i hated everyone in this club  so did i  i wasnt honest about who i was  i was tossing kids into dumpsters  i had never kissed a girl before  and i was getting slushied  i didnti didnt have a father  someone i could look up to  model myself after  someone who could show me what it really meant to be a man  we dont care what the judges say  we won  because we had you as a teacher  mercedes and glee club will never end  mr shue because  you are glee club  and youre in all of us now    those schoolgirl days     of telling tales     and biting nails are gone     but in my mind     i know they will     still live on and on     but how do you thank someone     who has taken you from crayons to perfume     oh it isnt easy     but ill try     if you wanted the sky i would write across the sky     in letters that would soar     a thousand feet high     to sir with love     the time has come     for closing books     and long last looks must end     and as i leave     i know that i am leaving     my best friend     a friend who taught me right from wrong     and weak from strong thats a lot to learn     what can i give you in return     oh if you wanted the moon     i would try to make a start     but i would rather     you let me give my heart     to sir with love   its as barren as me in here will  moving on to greener pastures  did you just come to gloat sue  mostly  well congratulations  you got what you wanted  i should shake your hand  not unless you got some hand sanitizer  ive seen that car you drive i dont want to catch poor  explain something to me  maybe we werent good enough yet to beat vocal adrenaline fine  but we were so much better than aural intensity  oh william i cant reveal how the voting went down  that would betray my sacred oath as judge or something  the results simply show  the other clubs to be more deserving  all i can say is casting my vote was easy  it reflected exactly how i felt in my heart  about which team should win  well sue congratulations  you win  i lose  the kids lose  i know you think im heartless will  and you may have a point  i spend large segments of each day  picturing you choking on food  and i recently contacted  an exotic animal dealer because i had  a very satisfying dream  that the two of us went to a zoo and i shoved your face  into one of those pink inflamed monkey butts  that weeps lymph  and i know that you think im a bad person  because i remain unmoved by your nattering of trite platitudes  to your illshapen students  about how the human condition can be improved  by yes singing about it  and ive proven that i can wipe you and your glee club  off the face of this earth  but what kind of a world would that be will  a world where i couldnt constantly ridicule your hair  world where i couldnt make fun of you for tearing up  more than michael landon in a sweeps weeks episode  of little house on the prairie  and you know what will  sue sylvesters not sure  she wants to live in that kind of world  so i had a little talk with figgins  glee club gets another year  i get what i want  do you really not understand  how this sexual blackmail thing works  enough sue  i will not be blackmailed by you anymore  i will tell my wife of our heated sexual congress  before i will be bullied by you again  one last chit figgy  give the glee club another year and i wont mention us  making the beast with two backs again  huh  we have another year  youre a good teacher will  now i dont like you so much  but i admire you  and the work youre doing with your kids  i really do  bon chance william  i relish the thought of another full year  of constantly besting you  you know sue inside  youre a really good person  you have a heart  okay let go of my hand  hey  i appreciate what youre doing for these kids  i wont forget it  and im seriously going to puke in your mouth  weve got another year  what  come on we got another year  what oh my god  yeah  are you serious   whoa  okay you guys i think this is the perfect opportunity for us  to start rehearsing for next years sectionals  immediately  guys youve all worked really hard this year  and you deserve a break but i have ideas  take the summer off  have some fun  oh but before you go i have something for you  you all sang for me the other day  so today id like to return the favor  puck if youre ready    ooh ooh ooh     ooh ooh ooh ooh     ooh ooh ooh     somewhere     over the rainbow     way up high     theres a land that i dreamed of     once in a lullaby     oh somewhere     over the rainbow     skies are blue     and the dreams that you dare to dream     really do come true   all the adoption papers seem to be in order  but theres no name on the birth certificate yet  its beth    oh someday ill wish upon a star     and wake up where the clouds are far     behind me     where troubles melt like lemon drops     high above the chimney tops     thats where     youll find me     oh somewhere     over the rainbow     bluebirds fly     birds fly over the rainbow     why then oh why cant i     i
