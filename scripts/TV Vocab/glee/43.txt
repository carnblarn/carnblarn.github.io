                1 so heres what you missed on glee  nationals is in new york city and everyones really excited  jessie st james is back in town  and hes starting a show choir consulting business  two things that im great at  show choir and destroying the competition  the new directions should hire him  a they really want to win and b hes superhandsome  terris back too and sue wants the honey badger  to take out the glee club terris back too and sue wants the honey badger  to take out the glee club  before they can get to new york  and thats what you missed on glee   new directions i would like to introduce you  to our new show choir consultant  jessie st james  i dont trust this guy  how do we know hes not just going to trick us  into doing something stupid so his alma mater wins  i dont think i need to do much tricking  to get you to do something stupid finn  guys jessie is just a consultant  i still make all the calls  now i have all the confidence in the world in you guys  i just think we could use all the help we can get  because  this is it  weve been working so hard for two years  for this moment and that moment is finally here  now i was talking with jessie and he agreed  that we should continue with our successful trend  of doing original songs for the competition  i was thinking of doing one group number  and one duet rachel and i should sing a duet  we killed it last year at regionals with faithfully  yeah killed us we lost  may i uh yeah  i agree that rachel should sing lead  but finn i think its best if you sit this one out  fact is most of the other guys in here are better singers  and mike chang who cant even sing can at least dance  you kind of sing and dance like a zombie who has to poop  youyou see you see what im talking about  the guys a jerk  jessie maybe you could uh be a little bit gentler  with your advice gentle  yes im sorry  i didnt realize that we were training  for the good try ribbon at nationals  i thought we were in it to win the whole damn thing  and theres only one way we can do that  poison darts  the vocal adrenaline strategy is simple  identify your best performer  and build the entire performance around them  so what does everyone else do  and whos our star performer  were going to have auditions to find out  im going to post a signup sheet  later this afternoon mr shue  dont you think this is kind of not our style  normally id agree with you finn but this is the big time  i think we should listen to jessie  i just dont know what youre so angry about  honey badger i am lactating with rage  the glee club travels  to new york for nationals in one week  they have purchased airline tickets  tickets that i would like to screw up  i asked you to recruit an expert computer hacker  and you bring me this  do i get a super villain nickname  your nickname is panda express  but im not chinese  neither is the food at panda express  look im on top of this  all the official travel for the school  goes through the lima heights travel agency  all we have to do is email them  through principal figgins email account  so whats the hold up we dont know his password  principal figgins is an idiot  something america is chock full of  what is the most common password in america  one two three four  were in outstanding  the travel agency sent arday  confirming an itinerary with a layover in chicago  before heading on to new york  compose an email requesting a flight  thats routed through tripoli  tripoli wait isnt that in libya  the second that plane touches the tarmac  theyll be swarmed by armed militants  wait areare we trying to have the glee club killed  or kidnapped and killed  panda make it so  someone really woke up on the wrong side of the bed today  you have no idea  mr schuester  oh hey becky  mr schuester im donna jackson  im beckys mom  i really need to talk to you  i want to be in glee club  well thats great becky can you sing  not really but neither can most of the kids in glee club  but ii thought you were having  such a good time on the cheerios  sue kicked her off  becky youre off the cheerios  i dont want to see you anymore is that understood  did i do something wrong coach  you heard what i said  i want your pompoms on my desk by the end of the day  i ii dont know what to say  beckys been totally depressed  she hasnt been eating  can i please be in glee club mr shue  i just want to belong  becky  were a week away from nationals  i mean i mean the the season is almost over  id love for you to join next year  but for now i  im afraid there just isnt a place for you  we understand  thank you for your time  yeah  i hate this school  you are a terrible person  becky was loyal to you sue  cheerios gave her a sense of purpose  and then you just rip it away from her for no reason  im going to be honest with you will  i do have a reason  she reminds me of my sister  what does that have to do with anything  you love your sister  i do william and she died yesterday  what  you know when we were younger people always told me  jean wouldnt live very long  used to be that people with downs didnt live past 30  but then she turned 35 and then 40  and when she turned 50 i thought somehow  we might grow old together  last week she got pneumonia  doctor said it wasnt bad and they put her on antibiotics  i was there with her  i wanted to stay the night  and she told me to go home  at 200 am i got the call  that she had passed away in her sleep  sue i am so sorry  could you leave me alone please  to think two short years ago  i was marching down this hall  to sign up for glee club auditions  and now look at me look at us  nationals so much has changed  i didnt have my bangs id never had a boyfriend  and i still had a tiny layer of baby fat  but theres one thing that hasnt changed my dreams  im still going to be a star  which means i would kill to get this solo  hey you havent signed up to be the lead vocalist  at nationals  santana mercedes and kurt have  hey  youre the male lead of this group finn  everybody looks to you for guidance i dont need nationals  to feel better about myself  weweweve weve been working  towards this moment for two years now  and ive been busting my ass to be  a better singer and dancer for two years  and that jessie ki comes in and he wipes out  all that hard work in ten seconds  my confidence is shot  no youre youre really good finn  okay you have to believe me  im im lima good  not new york city good  rrachel im sorry  im not auditioning  wow will thats a lot of vests  um okay lets get started  so ive got one box for going with you  one box for storage and one box for giving away  im not going away forever emma  rehearsals for aprils show  start two days after nationals  and then opening night is three weeks later  im guessing we close that night  and then im back on a bus  back to my vests the next day  will you stop stop with all that  youre too afraid to admit  that youre leaving but you are  thats why youve asked me  to help pack up your apartment  and thats why were going through your vests  do the kids know no way  cant let anything distract them from the task at hand  besides by the time they get back  from summer break ill be home  you are so organized  thank you  whoa that ones a keeper  i wore this the first week of glee club  mmm right  what about um what about this one  will did you wear this the first time you tried  the new coffee machine in the teachers lounge  thats the one i was wearing the first time i met you  well you know what  you have to let it all go  youre following your dreams  coach sylvester  we brought you some flowers and stuff  were sorry for your loss  put them over there with the rest  there were more arrangements  but i had to throw some of them out  im allergic to pansies  and i dont mean that as a swipe at either of you  so whyd you bother doing this  buying me flowers comforting me  after ive actively  made your life a living hell  and enjoyed doing it  we both know what its like  to lose someone really close to you  i sort of do my dad died when i was a baby  yeah his dads dead and my moms dead  so how do you think you can help me  are you here to tell me how to deal with this not at all  cause if i was being honest with you  eddie munster and herman munster  i dont know how to deal with this  i cant go back into that nursing home  and start sorting through jeans things  and i wont plan a funeral  have you told your mother yet  as far as im concerned  she said her goodbyes to us years ago  if you boys would really like to help me  you might start by explaining  why it was her time and not mine  shes the sweetest person i ever met  and as both of you can attest im probably the meanest  so how come im the one  still standing here talking to you  we need to help her  shes overwhelmed and  she needs us to help her  seriously id like to put  the fun back in funeral just as much as the next girl  but why would the glee club  help coach sylvester plan a service  were not doing it for sue were doing it for her sister  jean is just like us guys  i mean shes been an outsider and an underdog  all of her life  we of all people should celebrate that  can i say something  when someone dies yes its a tragedy  but its also a part of life  and you cant let death put your life on hold  now i dont mean to be blunt  but i dont think you should be planning a funeral  the same week you should be focusing  on the set list for nationals  seriously  you youre serious  actually yes i am  do you know what vocal adrenaline is doing right now  theyre in their third week of 24houraday rehearsals  theyre on an iv drip  thats how hard theyre working  do you know what happens in vocal adrenaline  if someone dies during a number  they use them as a prop like weekend at bernies  no  thanks for your input jessie but were  helping sue with the service for her sister  rachel you said i needed to be more of a leader  of this club well here goes  im making the call  were doing this  sue hold on a second  finn and kurt told me that you agreed  to let the glee club help out  with your sisters funeral and i  i just wanted to say that were honored  and it takes a big person to reach out like that  and ask for help  i didnt ask for help they volunteered  and i only agreed on the condition that  frankenteen and lady trousers help me  clean out jeans room at the nursing home  they look like they could use the exercise  and i like the idea of using your glee club as unpaid labor  sue i know youre going through a hard time right now  and despite our differences i just i just want you to know  that you can lean on me if you need to  oh william i wouldnt dare lean on you  so much grease in your hair id probably slide right off  im still not convinced that this is the best idea  i dont want any of the kids to feel like theyre losers  but thats a crucial part of the process  you see i took a class at ucla in judging for reality tv shows  so im totally ready to give feedback  thats both blistering and unhelpful  it was a really good class i learned a lot  were ready for the first contestant  my name is santana lopez and i will be singing  amy winehouses back to black  he left no time to regret   kept his lips wet   with his same old safe bet   me and my head high   and my tears dry   get on without my guy   and i tread a troubled track   my odds are stacked   i go back to black   we only said goodbye with words   i died a hundred times   you go back to her   and i go back to   black   black   i go back to   i go back to   we only said goodbye with words   i died a hundred times   you go back to her   and i go back to black   fantastic santana  thanks so much for coming in  wait ththats all you have to say  you spent the entire performance scribbling notes  well if you really must know i was simply writing down  that i dont think that your performance went very deep  into the emotional truth of the song  oh is that so  well i happen to have some feedback for you  thanks santana ththats all well need  im about to go all lima heights  ththank you  hello im kurt hummel and ill be singing  some people from gypsy  ah great selection kurt  hit it  some people can get a thrill   knitting sweaters and sitting still   thats okay for some people   who dont know theyre alive   some people can thrive and bloom   living life in the living room   thats perfect for some people   of 105   but i at least gotta try   when i think of all the sights that i gotta see   and all the places i gotta play   all the things that i gotta be at   come on papa what do you say   some people can be content   playing bingo and paying rent   thats peachy for some people   for some humdrum people to be   but some people aint me   i had a dream   a wonderful dream papa   goodbye to blueberry pie   good riddance to all the socials i had to go to   all the lodges i had to play   all the shriners i said hello to   hey la im coming your way   some people sit on their butts   got the dream yeah but not the guts   thats living for some people   for some humdrum people i suppose   well they can stay and rot   but not rose   all right good job buddy  kurt  you do know that song was meant to be sung by a woman right  yes im aware  and the glee club sort of dealt with that whole  boys singing songs that are meant for girls  oh its kind of old news  then you must know that that song was done  to great fanfare by such broadway legends as  merman lupone bernadette  those are some awfully big heels to fill  and im just not quite sure that you nailed it  usually at this point the reality show would  go to commercial then we would take a five minute break  to regroup and get touchups done on our makeup  so im gonna hit the little boys room  youre doing a great job though  i really think that you should comment more  dont be shy  jessie st james totally jessie st sucks  he said i shouldnt be singing girl songs  i make my living singing girl songs  i think the winner of four show choir championships  might be able to give us all some valuable insight  we know youre in love with him rachel  but do you have to be so obvious  dont use the fact that jessie and i once had feelings  for each other as an excuse for my inevitable win  correction you had feelings for him  he made breakfast on your head  look jessie and i both appreciate the integrity  of show choir too much to soil the competition  hes just gonna vote for whoever is best  that would be me you guys can fight over whos gonna  come in second all you want because i kicked that song  square in the balls  im so gonna win this thing  no bother warming up rachel  im about to go out there and wrap this thing up  like a christmas present  oh she may get weary   them young girls they do get wearied   wearing that same old shaggy dress   yeah   but when she gets weary   try a little tenderness   oh maybe mmm   you wont regret it no   young girls they dont forget it   love is their whole happiness   yeah yeah yeah yeah   but its all so easy   all you got to do is try   try a little tenderness   yeah all youot to do isman   hold her where you want her   squeeze her dontease her   never leave her   get to her got to try   try a little nderness   oh yeah   squeeze her dontease her   never leave her   try try try yeah   tenderness   oh yeah   you got to you got to yeah yeah   rub her gentle man   dont bruise her no no   you g to loveer tease r squee her ye   try a ltle tenderness    will oo  wow mercedes  just wow  you know seeing you up there  brought me back to the first time  you auditioned for glee club  you were great back then  but you were just amazing now  thank you for singing that  and thank you for reminding me where we started  and where were going to now nationals  thank you mr shue  i couldnt have done it without you  youre not a star youre just a girl who can really sing  exexcuse me  i dont think you want this  badly enough mercedes  how many times did you practice that song  practice  no i feel my material and i sing with emotion  im in the moment mr st james  i dont need to practice  actually you do  and how long did you work on that choreography  oh wait there was none  youre lazy mercedes  not too lazy to come up there and let you taste my fist  whoever gets this solo  is gonna have to work on it day and night  do you think youre ready for that  i do i dont  i hate him  hi my name is rachel berry  and ill be singing the most difficult song ive ever sung  great what song  uh barbras closing number  to my favorite movie funny girl  rachel in your head  are you singing to anyone in particular  not really  oh  oh my man i love him so   hell never know   all my life is just despair   but i dont care   when he takes me in his arms   the world is bright   all right   whats the difference if i say   ill go away   when i know ill come back   on my knee someday   for whatever my man is   i am his   forevermore   oh my man i love him so   hell never know   all my life is just despair   but i dont care   when he takes me in his arms   the world is bright   all right   whats the difference if i say   ill go away   when i know ill come back   on my knee someday   for whatever my man is   i am his   forevermore   she may be difficult but boy can she sing  bravo  i have to be honest  that was brilliant  i have nothing but the tip of my hat  garbage this whole thing is rigged  hold on santana like i said before i make  the final call here well then make it  out of respect to you all  im going to take a couple days  and consider all the results  now i will let you all know by friday  great job everyone  we sorted jeans stuff into piles  over there are some old magazines and newspapers  that you can just toss out and this is stuff  youre definitely going to want to keep  uh photos and stuffed animals  and this third pile is stuff  that we dont really know what to do with  um pompom  toss it its not worth anything  are you sure  willy wonka and the chocolate factory  oh i love that movie  then you can take it its probably worn out  she watched it at least three times a week  just toss it all out  what  you heard me its all junk  ill take the stuffed animal  jeans had this since she was six  everything else just toss it out i dont need it  but there are a lot of memories here  you know im not short on memories of my sister so  i know what its like  to lose someone  when someone dies it hurts  very astute porcelain  thats a little nugget of wisdom id really like to jot down  coach sylvester were just trying to help  you know what cottage cheese youre not helping  youre actually making things worse  so do me a favor and take all this stuff to the dumpster  on your way to the rehearsal for whatever treacly ballad  youre planning on using to ruin my sisters funeral  why did you agree to this then  if you hate us so much then why  are you letting the glee club plan the service  i was afraid no one would come  jean didnt know a lot of people  i figured with the glee club there  at least shed have a full house  hey sue  you look nice  thank you for coming  jean always stood up for you  when i told her stories about how evil your hair was  did anyone come  its a full house actually  workers from the home  other residents their families  your sister touched a lot of people  what do you think coach sylvester  you told us that willy wonka  was jeans favorite movie  the way you described jean made her sound so special  so we wanted her funeral to be special also  something to capture and express  the joy of her life  rather than the sadness of her death  its lovely  lets sit  welcome to the most unusual funeral  that i have ever attended  which makes sense because jean was the most unusual person  that i ever had the pleasure to spend every sunday  for the last 30 years with  i think that jeans sister sue would like to say a few words  i miss my sister  every night at 1000 or so  she used to call me on the phone  and when i asked her why  shed tell me that her body told her  she wanted to hear my voice  hey  ill read it  i miss my sister  the smell of her shampoo  the way she could always convince me  to read her another book  when you love someone like i loved her  theyre a part of you  its like youre attached by this invisible tether  and no matter how far away you are  you can always feel them  and now every time i reach for that tether  i know theres no one on the other end  and i feel like im falling into nothingness  then i remember jean  i remember a life led with no enemies  no resentments no regrets and im inspired  to get up out of bed and go on  i miss my sister so much  it feels like a piece of me has been ripped off  just one more time i want to hold her  ten more seconds is that too much to ask  for ten more seconds to hold her  but i cant  and i wont  and the only thing keeping me  from being swallowed whole by sadness  is that jean would kill me if i did  so for now im just going to miss her  i love you jeanie  rest in peace  this was jeans favorite song  hold your breath make a wish  count to three  come with me   and youll be   in a world   of pure imagination   take a look   and youll see   into your imagination   well begin   with a spin   traveling in the world of my creation   what well see   will defy   explanation   if you want to view paradise   simply look around and view it   anything you want to do it   want to change the world   theres nothing to it   there is no   life i know   to compare with pure imagination   living there youll be free   if you truly   wish to be   thank you  sorry long line in the restroom  everyone was fixing their mascara  mm  you did such a great job with the funeral  im so proud of you  why are you crying  because im breaking up with you  because of rachel  cause you still love her  i shouldnt have done this with you  i thought that i could fix  everything from last year but i  i cant  i just cant and  that feeling that sue was talking about in there of being  tethered to someone i i just  i dont feel that way about you  but you do with her  no  were not breaking up  i can handle your confusion with rachel  until you get over it  were gonna stay together  and next year well be prom king and queen  just stop it  okay i dont want that life  dont you feel anything anymore  this is real  this is happening  are you happy now  is this me feeling enough for you  quinn im sorry i still love you  just dont touch me  action  well it was a tough competition  but heres the dope  santana too mean kurt too controversial  mercedes i said it twice and ill say it again  lazy bones  rachel is the clear winner  im really not comfortable having this conversation taped  well i cant practice reality show judging without a camera  its like practicing skiing without skis  ive totally done that  okay brittany can you just turn that thing off  just the off switch right right over there just  yeah i know how to turn it off thanks  okay its cool  jessie maybe you can come on  fondue for two and judge my cat  rock and roll i have to be honest jessie  the more we talk about this  the more uncomfortable i feel about all of it  it just feels like im telling  one of my children that theyre my favorite  well thats what my parents told me in front of my siblings  sure some might say that it led  to my brothers whippet addiction  and my sisters bulimia but my parents owed them the truth  you really think picking rachel means we beat vocal adrenaline  its in the bag  coach can i come in  hello becky  im turning in my pompoms and the megaphone  that you got me  ill miss our time together  im gonna stop you right there becky  have you ever heard of menopause  well i fired you in a hormonal fury  i like to call womb rage and i apologize  now id like you to pick up those pompoms  and that megaphone  you know why  next year youre captain of the cheerios  oh my gosh thanks coach  got to call my mom  uh hold it right there  im not finished  i want you to give me a hug  come here  that seat taken  no  william i have to say something  in the history of our relationship  ive said many things to you  but theres one thing ive never said  good luck  you know i spent all this time hating you  and hating that glee club  i do this thing where i sort of alternate  which one of those kids i hate the most  right now its the dancing asian  but after what you did for my sister  i just cant do it anymore  you have something jean had that i do not have  a pure heart  youre a very good friend william  and i have not been that to you  yeah you really havent  so its time for a change  starting today i will no longer be going after the glee club  frankly i have bigger fish to fry  im running for the united states house of representatives  im im sorry  whatwhat did you say  in the last year of her life  jean faced ballooning health care costs  and cuts to her disability payments  well the sue sylvester american liberty party thinks  thats a load of phooey  there is one slight problem  in a fit of pique i rerouted the glee clubs plane to libya  wait what  it took some effort  it was a long fit of pique  i had some help panda express really came through for me  so were not going to new york  i can explain that  will im gonna leave you two alone  as this just became super awkward  these are firstclass tickets on american airlines  how did you afford them  well do you know that if you complain  to the airline about contracting monkey pox  in the bathroom on the plane  you can get the president of the airline  on the phone within an hour  but you didnt no of course not  have you been on their planes theyre immaculate  no it turns out that one of the vice presidents  of american airlines is a big supporter  of the arts or something  so when i told him your glee clubs sob story  he gladly came up with the tickets  for you guys to make it happen  this is amazing terri  wait  whats the catch  im moving to miami  sheets n things is opening a new branch down there  and they have asked me to manage it  like full on manager  the assistant title is officially dropped  look will i know that i made your life  challenging sometimes but  it was only because i loved you so much  i loved you too  we just werent right  no regrets though  no not one  just try to relax a little bit while  youre down there okay  oh yeah i mean you deserve  to enjoy yourself  okay  okay  ill see you around will  hey hey  is everything okay with terri  yeah finally  it is  is are you wearing one of my old vests  yeah i didnt have the heart to throw it away  emma this isnt forever  i hope it is  really will you deserve this  youve given so much for so long  and now its your turn  but um dont be a stranger okay  thank you  jessie  thats sweet  you remember the masculine click of my designer boots  okay why did you ask me  to meet you here right before the list goes up  is this good news or is it bad news  rachel i did wrong by you last year  and i came back to make that wrong right  and i came here to tell you  that youre going to be the featured soloist  at nationals in new york  wait wait how do you know  did mr schuester tell you  let it suffice to say  that i was very involved in the decision  oh  no ii i feel bad  everyone else worked so hard  now theyre just going to hate me  they sort of already do and  you know as well as i  that sometimes thats the price of fame  i used to think that fame was the only thing that mattered  and now i realize that theres something  that matters to me more  what  you  come on  i think the list is posted  this doesnt make any sense  guys it was a tough decision  but its for the good of the club  although this is deeply personal  try not to take it personally  um you guys might want to read what the list says  what why  oh mr shue thank god youre here  to put these trolls out of their misery can you just announce  my win so that i can get on with teasing the losers  i heard your performance santana  this is mine and you know it  see jessie this is the kind of infighting  and me first attitudes that i wanted to avoid  what you call infighting i call motivation  and this is just the beginning once we get to nationals  ill have them willing to kill each other for that solo  no  ive changed my mind  were going back to what got us here  original songs sung by the entire club  were a team  and were best when we work as one  youre going to lose  whatever we do  were going to do it together  actually santana you sounded pretty good  thanks you guys were all pretty dope too  even rachel  i wish i could sound like you do santana  i mean how do you get that raspiness  so nice i smoke cigars  all right guys time to get to work  now i want two hit songs  by the time the wheels touch down at jfk come on  hey thanks for what  i know youre hurting right now  but its really cool you didnt quit glee club  if i quit glee club my big plans  for new york would have been ruined  what plans youll see
