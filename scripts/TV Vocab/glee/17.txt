funny  you guys arent watching the video of me falling  off stage at my first tinytots beauty pageant are you  that was carrot top funny  compared to this comedic tour de force  jessie thats olivia newtonjohns physical  it was pretty groundbreaking subject matter at the time  considering its depiction of fluid sexuality  mercedes oh my good laughter  wait wait  thats not olivia newtonjohn  thats thats sue sylvester  where did you get this  i can tell you that i certainly did not  steal it from her locked file cabinet yesterday  when she sent me back to her office  to get her hormone replacement injection  during cheerios practice  laughter  wait  did she just do the cabbage patch  laughter  im posting this on youtube  rachel no no wait wait  do you think thats a good idea  she might kill us  oh let her get a taste of some of  the humiliation she put us through  jessie im with finn  you guys need to stop being such asses and start being badasses  laughter  ten bucks it goes viral by lunch    lets get animal animal    hey ms sylvester  lets get physical  not really my type but i like that attitude  hey sue  lets get animal  school bell ringing  that glee club stole my private property and posted it online  and as soon as i figure out  the difference between slander and libel  im filing a lawsuit  will sue dont you think  you might be overstating this a little  will i may buy a small diaper for your chin  because it looks like a babys ass  that video has received over 170000 comments  i took the liberty of printing out a few  the man in this video looks like  the champion cheerleading coach sue sylvester  that was particularly hurtful  clears throat you know sue there are a lot  of people at this school who dislike you  my kids dont do stuff like this  is that so  exhibit b  whats a glist  its the glee list william  its a weekly ranking of your glee club  based on a hotness quotient of sexual promiscuity  it was posted all over the school an hour ago  apparently you get a point  for each act of perpetuated depravity  what makes you think my kids did this  this glist was made on a library computer  using the pass code gleeclub  your glee club is a petri dish of sexual depravity  sues right will  why only last year a list was posted  ranking mckinleys ten ugliest gingers  and the perpetrator would have  been expelled had it not turned out  to be a member of the faculty  i stand by that list  william this is serious  i cannot have an environment that sexualizes children  and damages their selfesteem  you know a week ago had i fod a list  that so degraded the glee club i wouldve been embarrassed  i was beaten to the punch  but now i know the whitehot shame  of public rebuke that pain is indescribable  william last year at west dayton high  a photo circulated of  school superintendent and what was he wearing  womens lingerie and what was he riding  pony and who was expelled  the entire school  the entire school was expelled will  what does that have to do with me  you must find out who made the glist  and suspend them before they post another one  or im holding the entire glee club responsible  are you serious  deadly serious  i cannot have these shenanigans at this school  he cannot have these shenanigans at this school  who did it  this is serious  principal figgins is threatening to disband the club  why are we playing this game  we all know it was puck  back off i didnt do squat  then why is your girlfriend first on the glist  and why am i last  aside from the fact that i refused to put out for you  okay enough no one is accusing anyone of anything  puck seriously did you do it  i said no  im a delinquent sure  i like setting stuff on fire  and ating up people i dont know  i own at but im not a liar  all right heres the important point  between this and posting coach sylvesters  personal video on youtube you guys are getting  a pretty bad reputation  why is that a bad thing  maybe if we seem more dangerous  people would stop flushing my glasses down the toilet  look things are hard right now  i get it youre under a lot  of pressure with regionals coming up  and i know that winning sectionals hasnt had  the positive effect on your popularity  that a lot of you thought it would  but becoming what you despise is not the answer  man this song is wack  no its not  its a terrific song  on a long list of top hits that  because of time or some bad press has become a joke  and like you guys its time to start  rehabilitating its bad reputation  the assignment for the week  is for all of you to find songs like this  mine them for what works  and make them great again  and then hopefully  can apply this musical lesson to your own lives  this song should be arrested for the crime of sucking  laughter

bell ringing  murmuring  sue this is not happening  the cruel slowmotion laughter is just your imagination  youre sue sylvester legend  theyre not laughing at you  because of your physical video  just calmly pour yourself a cup of joe and focus  wait whats that smell  dear god thats coffee  its usually masked by the smell of fear  sweet merciful lord this is happening  youre being laughed at in slow motion  by a roomful of inferiors whom you used to terrify  the name is brenda  brenda castle  i just transferred from fort wayne  i cant teach in indiana anymore  cause i have some drug problems  that ended up involving some of my shootins  laughing i saw your video  and you my friend are an embarrassment  and thats me talking  laughter echoes  bell ringing  i need to enlist the services of the av club  what did you have in mind  my shame at appearing so low on the glist has made me reevaluate  my image at this school and beyond  ive now realized that in todays culture  of bad boy athletes and celebrity sex tapes  a good reputation is no good at all  artie you know how our glee club assignment was  to find a song with a bad reputation and rehabilitate it  well mine is going to afford me  the worst reputation in this school  rachel berry is going to get a little down and dirty  im going to stop you  you had me at sex tape  how can i help  hold onto your hat  because rachel berry is going to become  whispers musically promiscuous  because our freefalling reps have reached terminal velocity  we are at defcon one  were such zeros they didnt even bother  putting us on the glist  what does a clister do when their tiny star  is about to fall off perez hiltons radar screen  they cause a scandal so extreme  they can no longer be ignored  um excuse me  why is she here  ive been here since first period  i had a cold and i took all my antibiotics  at the same time and now i cant remember how to leave  but i also dont know why ive only made fourth  on the glist  ive made out with like everyone in this school  girls boys mr kidney the janitor  i need to do  something to get into the top three  fine youre in in what  we dont even have a plan  what is the worst thing a student can do at this school  eat in the cafeteria  snickering  no be a disruption in the library  and im not talking about  trying to check out a reference book  mmmm  im talking about fullon chaos  including getting your glee on in the stacks  genius  i never really understood how hard it is to be laughed at  particularly in slow motion  i try to make it seem  like nothing can touch me but  boy  jean im so sorry you ever felt that way  im sorry i didnt protect you more  remember what we used to do sue  whenever i got sad  wed help at the animal shelter  to give back  because theres always someone whos got it worse than you do  bell ringing im a little confused  i understand  youre probably wondering what exactly does sue sylvester mean  when she says im your new therapist  well let me explain  as you may or may not know i star in a little music video  thats been circulating around the web  a video that has a tendency to induce  cruel slowmotion laughter  no no didntdidnt know about that  well this video  has inspired sue sylvester to start giving back  i happen to have my masters in counseling  and when i heard that our school districts  one and only psychologist had committed suicide  well i decided to volunteer my services  and they gave me your name  id really like to help  i dont know how im supposed to feel about this  ella youre crippled by mental illness  your compulsions have estranged you  from your own feelings  you nearly married a gym teacher whos more gravy than man  and youre content to be repeatedly lied to  by the man you purport to love im sorry  i bribed will schuesters landlord  to slip baby monitors under his couch  and under his bed  turns out hes been having make out sessions  with the coach from vocal adrenaline  and sleepovers with that worldclass banana magnet  april rhodes oh my god  you need to make a bold move  you suck  excuse me  you take weird little strides when you walk  as if you were raised in imperial japan  and someone bound your feet  you make a valid point  grow a pair im insulting you  you refuse to stand up for yourself  youre so afraid of confrontation  youre right  if you want to get better  you need to start communicating your feelings  you need to let will schuester know how hes made you feel  and in a public setting so he canescape  and he wont manipulate you  trust me  you need to let him have it  rachel do you know that when we dated the rest of the school  gave us a nickname  puckleberry  thats humiliating  the fact is that slumming it with me  actually improved your reputation  it gave you a sense of humanity  wait do you want to date again  i was wondering why you invited me here  as you know im taken  but i can be of some assistance  help me with my song for glee club i might be  the last chance you have to salvage  whats left of your reputation and stay in glee  besides you need a song  that going to help you express your inner pain  so what song do you want to do for your assignment  ive chosen david geddes fantastically terrible  70s top ten hit run joey run  its a story song  so we get to play parts  im going to play the role of the tragic heroine  who dies in the end   la nicole kidman in moulin rouge  and you can be the hunky heroic male lead  do i get to kill you  actually my dad shoots me with a shotgun  sighs  do you think i made that glist honestly  well it does sound like something that you would do  god im so tired of people judging me  for a few mistakes ive made  i try to be a good guy  i go to school and i say be cool puck be nice  but by second period ive got a fire extinguisher in my hands  and im spraying some dweeb with it  and i dont know how i got there  i understand yeah  i sit in glee club and i watch  a couple of imperfect performances  and a litany of criticisms just start building up inside of me like a volcano  and i keep telling myself to hold it in  and then it just comes bursting out  granted generally im right  but doesnt do much for my reputation  it does suck when you do that  so uh how do you think we can get people to see us differently  i dont know  i cant i cant do this  you know whoever made  that glist is going to put you at number one  when they find out you cheated on that jessie kid with me  besides jessie will never fully understand what it means to be a jew  noah  im ironically turned on by your bad boy image  but i think we should just keep this professional  all right im out  why should i stay if theres no chance of us making out  noah please come and sit down and lets work on the project  okay itll help us both  i promise   bell rings  i dont think i can do this  are you sure this is a good idea  stop thinking about him and do it for yourself  okay lets do this  nah cant go in the teachers lounge  lots of cruel slowmotion laughter going on in there  well look who it is  i thought i smelled a laughingstock  dont start with me castle or i will kick you square in the taco  its

find out about that  youre not denying it  wow okay  see i thought we were trying to work through this  i thought when you said you were trying to figure out things  on your own i thought you meant

kids to perform that  for our sunday service   i dont like doing this any more than you do  but if i dont find out who made that glist  and stop another one from being published  the whole glee clubs going down  and i cant let that happen  look i know ive been kind of angry lately  and sometimes i kick over chairs and stuff but i didnt do it  all the pieces fit finn you have a very big axe to grind  with several people on that glist  quinn broke your heart puck betrayed your friendship  youre dealing with kurts dad dating your mom  and i happen to know youve had your ups and downs  with santana and brittany  i have nothing against santana and i like brittany  quinns the one who has a beef with them  well there are an awful lot of cheerios on that glist  isnt it true that you still feel like  an outcast in that group  i dont know what youre talking about  i like being a cheerio  and why does everyone just assume im angry all the time  its called being sassy mr shue  its simple math mr shue  the glists are posted at a height of five and a half feet  comfortably out of my reach it could not have been me  and i have it on good word that  i saw puckutting up the glist in the hallway i was moving it  somebody put it up on rachels locker so i moved it  i was being a man doing the right thing  puck at some point the lies are going to stop  and youre going to start to sing  if i did it why would i put myself at number three  as far as badasses go im number wha  ill say it again i didnt do it  i dont know how to turn on a computer  rachel did it  think about it i stole the guy  shes in love with then i stole the guy she dated  to get over the guy shes in love with  and im kind of a bitch to her just doesnt seem like rachel  shes gone behind your back before  and i mean whos to say that theres only one culprit  look i know you know something  so were not leaving here until i get some answers  mr schuester may i be blunt  sighs  shoot  ever since you separated from your wife  youve spent a lot of late nights  watching reruns of law and order havent you  hmm thought so  and no i didnt make the glist  sighs  right  bell ringing  were as menacing as muppet babies  which means our squeakyclean reputations  are still very much intact  we have to do what weve been dreading  something more terrifying than rachels personality  we have to go to sylvester  and admit that we posted the physical video  but well get suspended  and it will be worth it  finally the entire student body  will see us as badasses  dear journal i dont know how much longer  i can take the humiliation  the video has just surpassed three million hits  is my misery some kind of karmic retribution  for the way ive treated people  phone ringing  youre go for sue  hello sue  its olivia newtonjohn star of grease  the most successful movie musical of all time  nice try and thats a ridiculous accent  uh  journal ive learned my lesson  sue sylvesters gotta start playing nice fulltime  phone rings  hi uh we must have been cut off  its olivia newtonjohn  i released a record sevenconsecutive  number one singles  sing something    lets get physical      physical    that song was the bestselling  record of the 80s  listen sue im headed for a ribboncutting ceremony  at a sanctuary for orphaned koalas  but i heard my daughter chloe laughing at something  on the internet the other day  and i saw your video  and i just have to ask  whatever would possess a person  to do something like that  well i gotta tell you olivia  that video was never meant for public consumption  some people enjoy videotaping themselves  being intimate with a partner  i happen to enjoy revisiting the impeccable form  of my various jazzercise routines  well it got me thinking  you know that song was the biggest hit of my career  physical spent ten weeks at number one  its a classic  i agree  unfortunately i botched the video which  by the way was one of the first music videos ever  but i filled it with obese guys in spandex  and it went over the top and the song went with it  but i saw your youtube video sue  and i realized that now is the time  to save it and possibly you  ill be in ohio tomorrow chairing  a benefit for save the rainforests at kings island  i dont understand  bell ringing  hey manwhore  will schuester yeah  im brenda castle  im the new astronomy teacher and badminton

either  but lately ive been feeding my feelings to the tune  of 6000 calories a day  sighs  slut  remember if sylvester hits you in the fbce  after you cop to posting the video  dont scream like a woman  youre so brave for doing this kurt  i know thank you  oh my god  coach sylvester can i have just a minute of your time  what do you want ladyface  youre aware a tape was leaked  onto the internet causing you to become  a national laughingstock  we stole the tape from your syringeandpill drawer  we posted it online  well accept whatever punishment you see fit  so it was you  i cant thank you enough  artie she wasnt angry at all  it was weird  maybe the comments online have gotten  so mean people have started to feel sorry for her  shes finally getting some sympathy  so shes in a forgiving mood  wait a second  take a look at this  typing  synthesizer playing pop song intro  isnt that    physical physical physical physical physical      im saying all the things that i know

 rachel how about you show us your bad reputation project  id like to say a few words first  though i understand that a motion picture  should stand on its own  i do realize that some of you are not wellversed  in the complex vocabulary of the filmic arts  i expect that this video will go over some of the heads  of our lesscultured teammates  so let me just say i hope you enjoy  my bad reputation  lights okay go  angelic harmonizing  rock ballad plays    ooh daddy please dont      it wasnt his fault      he means so much to me      daddy please dont were gonna get married      just you wait

watch out      then julie yelled hes got a gun      and she stepped in front of me      then suddenly a shot rang out      and i saw julie falling      i ran to her i held her close      when i looked down my hands were red      and heres the last words      julie said      daddy please dont it wasnt his fault      he means so much to me      daddy please dont      were gonna get married    angelic

finn  no hes right first of all i need to trust  my instincts more because i had a feeling  when we were shooting that that it was not going to be good  why didnt you tell me they were in this too  i thought you and i were going out  being triplecast with two other guys  to play opposite your girlfriend  its mortifying  it was an artistic statement  finn no it wasnt it was you  trying to look like  you had a bunch of guys fighting over you  so you could stop looking like some kind  of outcast and be seen  as some hot slutty girl singer  how could you do this to me  to all us guys  is your stupid reputation more important  than your relationships  jessie wait  jean i saw your video sue you were fabulous  you know i have  to thank you jean  you always know exactly what to say to me  when i lose my way  turns out all i needed was an attitude change  i forgot how good it feels to give back  ive spent so much time worrying  about what other people thought about me  when theres really only one person in the world  i want to impress  who  who you silly  so yesterday i walked  back into that teachers lounge  and i calmly informed them of my unlikely skyrocket  to showbiz fame and very gently  told them all i just didnt care what they thought about me  whats that oh look  sue sylvester is a top 700 recording artist people  whos laughing now huh  now since olivia is giving  her cut of the proceeds to injured manatees  ive decided to give  all of my profits to this nursing home  its not going to be much  olivia totally screwed me in negotiations  i wont be working  with her again but it should be enough  for a couple of benches out back for the summer  maybe a little vegetable garden for you to putter ound in  thatd be nice  yeah  now after all these years how is it  that you still know so much more about everything than i do  im the smart one  chuckles  you got the looks too  how is that fair  ah thank you  laughs lets say we crack open a book huh  okay  see that the two little bears  thats you and i thats right  im the big one right and im the small one  yeah youre the tiny one  and what does that say  i always love you  and i will always love you  bell ringing  knocks gently hey  uh these are for you  theyre lovely  thank you  clears throat  um ii messed up emma  i think in all of this  inhales deeply discovering who i am business  i took a couple of wrong turns  and i get how those detours  might have hurt you  but now i know that thats not who i am  or who i want to be  i know whats supposed to happen now  im supposed to smile  and be impressed by how in touch you are with your feelings  and moon over the fact that you care about me so much  but um  i cant  but emily ththis is this is killing me  i just  sighs  i want you to look at me the way you used to  i cant clears throat  but you know what thats a good thing  really if this relationship is ever going to work  between the two of us we have to start  seeing each other for who we really are  thank you for the flowers  i know youre behind the glist  you have no proof i cant believe  that youre going to pin this on me ill be expelled  i mean it makes sense  everything else has been taken from me  my popularity my body  might as well throw away my education  you know when i realized that you did it  the moment i felt what it was like  to walk in your shoes  i mean it takes years to build a good reputation  but only seconds to destroy it  couple bad choices and you go from the top  to the bottom  you have lost so much quinn  which means you had the most to gain from the glist  i never meant to hurt anybody  i i was captain of the cheerleading squad  president of the celibacy club  i had finn  people would part like the red sea when i walked  down the hallway  now im invisible  and you think being seen as a cheap tramp is better  a bad reputation is better than no reputation at all  look i know that high school feels  like your whole life right now  but

you were  what did they say most of them  had no idea who you were  the ones that did said you  were kind of sneaky hot but that that quality  was canceled out by a compulsive need to be right  and a strange affinity  for sweaters with animals on them  the most interesting part was  that even though no one particularly liked you  they all said you were a person who could be trusted  i still am  i
