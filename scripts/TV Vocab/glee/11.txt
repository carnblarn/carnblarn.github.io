                so heres what you missed last week  and thats what you missed on glee  hey fella  so unless my recent writeup here in splits magazine  naming me cheerleading coach of the decade has me driven completely insane  im pretty sure you and i had an agreement that you were going to show me  your glee club set list for sectionals  sorry sue  i didnt think you were all that interested in glee club anymore  not interested  well im the fine arts administrator or something  um well i will make sure you get a copy  thatd be fantastic  id hate to have to go to figgins about this  hey will yes  id like my magazine back please  thank you  heres the problem with sue sylvester  you never quite know where you stand  i knew she was up to something  five six seven eight  step ball change step step  unh and seven eight  step ball change step step unh  you guys go step ball  brittany  coach sylvester didnt tell me to do this  it kept getting worse  hey there pal  would you remind me once again the names of the schools  youll be competing against at sectionals  jane addams academy and haverbrook school for the deaf  got it what are their zip codes  shes leaking our competitive set list to the other schools  if the other glee clubs get set lists and videos  theyll know exactly how to beat us at sectionals  well first dont let sue distract you all right  and if you cant take mohammad to the mountain  then you got to get mohammad to bring the mountain  down to his house  mohammads house wherever hes staying  i dont understand look you should drive  over to jane addams academy  and ask the director pointblank  if somethings going on youll know  hmm   all right oh thanks  youre a good kid aphasia  why did you try to rob a bank  because ms hitchens  thats where they keep the money  go back to class uh hi ms hitchens  im will schuester from mckinley high  aphasia give mr schuester his wallet back  wow shes shes good  um  thank you thank you for seeing me  we dont get a lot of other educators paying us visits  right um  well the reason im here  is a little weird  so i guess the best thing for me to do is just come right out with it  i think our cheerleading coach has been passing along our set list for sectionals to you  what kind of messed up school are you people running  you think that because our students are thieves and arsonists that were cheaters too  no no no no i  its not that you its its sue  do you know that we dont have costumes  or even an auditorium  our show choir has to practice out in the rec yard  this is ohio we have weather  you dont have to tell me about underfunding for the arts  look all i know is that our choir seems to be  the only thing that keeps my girls from recidivism  it makes them feel good about themselves  im not going to cheat and risk that  just so we can get a leg up on your school of privileged misfits  especially from what i hear  were probably going to take you anyway  really and whod you hear that from  i had my spies at your invitational  want some coffee  please  im im really sorry  i didnt mean to offend you  let me make it up to you  you guys dont have an auditorium come use ours  yeah lets have a little uh scrimmage at our place  okay guys so first of all  i want to welcome ms hitchens and the jane addams glee club  were all very happy to have you guys here  so um were going to let you guys start us

great but were just as good  mr shue if i may  what they were doing was just all smoke and mirrors  its called hairography  what hairography  all the whizzing of their hair around  just to distract from the fact that theyre not really good dancers  and their vocals were just soso  trust me  weve nothing to be afraid of  all right guys  i did some thinking last night  i think i found our new number for sectionals  were going to do the title song from hair  now this show started a revolution  wait did they have mohawks back then like in the 20s or whatever  yeah mr shue if were going to do a song about hair  shouldnt we have more hair  one step ahead of you  here are your wigs  mr schuester yeah  what are you doing  we are fine where we are  we dont need hairography  its just a distraction  look i have to be honest  those jane addams girls did freak me out a little  and im worried about our chances for sectionals  i mean we have to pull out all the stops if we want to win  looking great guys  saw it in a bookstore  figured id steal it for you  you know in case you change your mind  and decide you want to keep it  that is so sweet  to be honest  i really dont know what im going to do about it anymore  my minds pretty messed up about everything  well whatever you decide  no pressure  okay  thank god for puck  thanks to him im starting to realize  that what i need right now even more than looser pants  is acceptance  everyone is putting so much pressure on me  its so easy for them to be distracted  i dont have that luxury  i am under siege  you dont drink diet soda do you  because the phosphoric acid causes male pattern baldness  the babys a girl  women go bald too  you worry too much terri  mom smoked and drank a bottle of riuniti on ice  every night when she was pregnant with us  and were totally normal  just take your vitamins stay out of the hot tub  and avoid rumbased drinks and youll be fine  maybe the problem isnt that i dont want to keep the baby  the problem is that  i dont want to keep the baby with finn  maybe i didnt give puck enough of a chance  he is the real dad after all  finn would freak if i started spending time with puck though  i need to distract him so that i can take puck for a test drive  but how  mm forget about it she looks like a five year old  still maybe with a little bit of makeup  hey kurt can i pick your pink brain for a second  why hello quinn  to what do i owe the honor  i do believe this is the first time youve ever spoken to me  im sorry about that  anyways i have a proposition to make  a makeover im in  makeovers are like crack to me uhhuh  my suggestion spanx  or a doubleknit camisole  with a control top for the baby bump  also babydoll dresses dead giveaway  not for me for rachel  why would i want to do that  i admit i like a challenge as much as the next guy but  rachel somehow manages to dress like a grandmother and a toddler at the same time  my point exactly  youre as concerned about the glee club succeeding as i am and shes a distraction  look at her shes wearing a pantsuit  dont you think the judges are going to take one look at her  and maybe want to knock her down a peg or two  and to think i thought you were a dumb blonde  deal  good night good night  what are you doing  im trying to be intimate with my wife no youre trying to have sex  wh not intimacy  if you wanted intimacy you  you would ask me how im feeling about being pregnant  youre right  im sorry  okay  it will all be worth it when she shows up right  yeah of course  love you love you  theres no way i can keep this up  hes gonna catch on  i miss him too though  i do want to have a family with him  i only ever started lying about all of this  to give us a chance  i just need to buy myself some more time  ive got to distract him with something  but what  ow  the key is to never wax above the eyebrow  always shape from below  trust me i get a lot of practice  look at mine  kurt why did you volunteer to give me a new look  one im a sucker for makeovers  and two you need something to distract from your horrible personality  most of the time i find it hard to be in the same room with you  especially this one  which looks like where strawberry shortcake and holly hobbie come to hook up  youre extremely talented rachel  watching you perform is amazing  but sometimes its hard to appreciate  what a good singer you are because all im thinking about  is shoving a sock into your mouth  well what kind of makeover did you have in mind  we need to broaden your appeal  i want every boy at school to do a double take when you strut past  theres really only just  one boy that id like to impress  can you keep a secret  of course  im in love with finn  really  i understand completely  lets move on to makeup  i happen to know for a fact that finn is attracted to loose women  what quinn is so wholesome  let me put this into musical theater parlance  in grease what did sandy do to get danny zuko  she had to ditch the poodle skirt and slap on a cat suit  in short she had to dress like a ho  maybe if your look was better  more desirable finn would be in your arms right now  instead of quinns  whats going on terr  just a couple more steps okay  all right stop okay  is that the blue bomber  it is  i remember i took you to prom in this car  we did it in the backseat  well this isnt actually your old car i found this one on ebay  you know i always regretted selling this car  i know thats why i got you this one  i thought maybe working on it would be a  a distraction from all the pressure that youve been under  you are the best  honey yeah  um could you go and get me a frozen yogurt  yeah sure  oh maybe ill stop by pep boys  maybe they have some advice  thats a good idea yeah  take your time honey  how could you bring her here  what if he saw her  youre gonna want to hear this  i gave little miss peroxide my phone number  in case of an emergency  and she called to drop the bomb on me  what what bomb  what is it  im keeping my baby  look we had no intention of discriminating against your glee club mr rumba  we extended an invitation to the jane addams academy to perform  because were lucky enough to have better facilities than they do  and you think we dont have the same problem  i run the glee club at a school for the deaf  you think im rolling around in deaf choir money  now sure my kids may be deaf  but that shouldnt distract everyone from the fact  that they still have a song in their heart  and they should have the same chance as everyone else to express it  now i had scarlet fever as a kid leaving me deaf in one ear  so i remember what its like to have full hearing  but my poor kids dont know the difference  all they know is that they love performing  and then they have to hear that mckinley went and invited  those bad girls to the school  thats just not fair its not fair  i think your phones ringing what  your phones ringing no i got it on vibrate  all i am saying is that it would be nice  if you went and hosted another scrimmage  and had the courtesy to invite us this time  i couldnt agree more  whats that  i said i agree with you  okay i cant hear you  talk into this ear scarlet fever  im sorry youre on  um hows monday  no it has to be monday  yes all right  monday  i cant wait to see the kids do their numbers  you dont have to make fun of me with those hand gestures  no i didnt  i didnt mean to  let me check with my secretary  oh damn four missed calls  whats that  i didnt say anything  yes thank you i take it black two sugars  hello  hello  i cant do this anymore  its time to tell him  terri yeah honey  oh hey kendra  damn will  you make one sexy grease monkey  i am having so much fun  working with my hands searching for parts all over town  i feel like im in a springsteen song  well i got to get some old dish towels mop up the grime  that car is the perfect distraction  i would get something like that for phil if i didnt think it would make him so happy  whats the difference  hes going to get pretty damn suspicious  when i come home from the hospital without a baby  you need to relax  and drink more  i have got this whole thing figured out  you do mmhmm  blondies due date is right around spring break  you and i  are going to have a ladys week at a spa down in cinci  that caters to the prenatal set  but in reality were gonna be camped out  at wus office with quinn until that high school hussy drops  thats a great plan  except for the fact that quinn wont give us her baby anymore  but she will dummy  we have to distract her with the reality of her situation  how are we going to do that  she needs money  im going to have her babysit my kids  five minutes alone with those little mongrels  and shell have her tubes tied  youre so smart  you got the beauty but i got the brains and the beauty  hey rachel  oh hey finn  i didnt see you there  did you want to ask me something  uh yeah ii just i forgot  i got distracted  well im glad i got your attention  i wanted to know if you wanted to come over on friday night  as someone whos had long luxurious locks  since i was a toddler in the pageant circuit  i figured i could give you  some tips on our hair number  yeah thatd be great  great hows 800  its terrific  objective achieved  commence phase two  hey quinn  i uh wanted to ask your permission  to maybe do something on friday night if  oh thats fine  im babysitting anyways  oh cool  ill see ya  hey  what are you doing on friday  just the usual  was going to stand outside the 7eleven looking depressed  until someone offered to buy me beer  but whats going on  you want to maybe babysit with me  some of you particularly the guys  have come up to me with some questions about hairography  one of our own has volunteered to walk us through it  she has got it down  brittany take it away  take what away  show us what you got  oh all right  so hairography  it works best when you pretend like youre getting tasered  so you just move your head around like youre spazzing and stuff  very nice wow  you guys its like cool epilepsy  come on guys  lets see what you got  good guys yeah  just relax and go for it all right  my neck my back  when is the lying going to stop sue  i dont know what youre talking about  youve been spying on me and we both know it  youll do anything to torpedo glee club  and it has got to stop  i resent that accusation william  and one i understand youve been making to our friends at haverbrook and jane addams  and its an outrageous affront to my sterling reputation  that being said fine i have been checking up on you  because i dont like whats going on in there  do you know why i make each of my cheerios wear her hair pulled back in a ponytail  because i dont want to distract from her impeccable talent  you seem to be taking the opposite approach will  and that leads me to believe you know your kids dont have what it takes  i believe in my kids  well maybe in the beginning but not now  now that youve seen the competition that threatens your very position at this school  youre going to get me an updated set list by 500 tomorrow  and if theres anything on that list that involves demeaning fruity hair tossing im cutting it  i will not let you dictate my number choices  and you are not getting that list  well then im back as codirector  okay guys from the top  ill just be a second  thanks again for helping me out with this hairography stuff  yeah i mean  you know its all about getting warmed up  could you think of a song  maybe that we could practice with  what about the the one from grease  you know we did it when you first joined the club  okay only i was just mostly  nervous that day but it  tell me about it stud   i got chills theyre multiplyin    and im losing control    cause the power youre supplyin    its electrifyin    you better shape up    cause i need a man    but my heart is set on you   wait stop stop  whats wrong  i need to be honest with you  imim really uncomfortable right now  im gonna say this as nicely as i possibly can  but you look like  a sad clown hooker  what  this look  it just isnt you  i mean maybe when i first saw it  i was caught off guard that you looked all adult and stuff but  its not whats really great about you rachel  i actually like the way you usually dress  sequined leg warmers and stuff  i thought this was what you liked  no not at all  funny i was just having this conversation last week with kurt and he asked me  so what kind of girls do you like  oh uh i like it when theyre natural and stuff  not a lot of makeup not skintight clothes  that sort of thing you know  totally  i feel like an idiot  no no this is my fault  it isnt right for me to be here anyway  but i really like you rachel  i gotta go  i told you we should have been the cowboys  my bad  what are we gonna do about this  who are you texting  uh mike ching hes got wind problems  well put the phone down and help me with this knot ive almost got it  stop that not the table  think of something  i brought my guitar why dont we sing them a lullaby  give me this  hey kids look at me  want to see a real live

enjoyed it  i was worried about you at first  you seemed distracted all that texting to mike  distracted i was the opposite babe  i was totally into it  all i know is we proved something tonight  this parenting thing we can do this  you set me up with finn  looks like someone is running for drama queen again  how could you do that  i thought we were friends  and what made you think that  you should be thanking me  all i did was help you realize that your schoolgirl fantasy  of running off with finn was nothing but a fairytale  you like him  yeah thats thats what this is  and you were just trying to eliminate the competition  i was just helping him understand  that you are not a viable second choice  you think im a second choice  a distant second  you think im living in a fairytale  if i were second or if i were 50th id still be ahead of you because im a girl  okay heres the dope princess  theres no hope for either of us  he loves quinn theyre having a baby together  were nothing but distractions  the sooner we realize that the better  keep your paws off my man  clear  whos your man  dont play stupid tubbers  oh and for the record asking someone to babysit with you is super 90s  i

 its definitely not all good  i thought you wanted to be with me  i do like a lot  but you havent given it up to me  since the night i knocked you up  and baby im a dude  i have needs  so you expect to raise a baby with me  and text dirty messages to every other girl at this school  if i dont give it up to you every day  no just the hot girls  look im going to be a good dad  but im not going to stop being me to do it  you can have her  are you serious  a girl really needs a good father  and the only way shes going to get that  is if i give her to you  you think mr shues going to be a good father dont you  yeah  i think hes going to be an amazing dad  will hey guys  i thought you were going to be at the scrap yard all afternoon  oh yeah uh change of plans  got distracted with something else  uh quinn what are you doing here  oh girl talk  were exchanging pregnancy war stories  oh thats nice  well when you get a sec  can you meet me out in the garage ter  oh i was just leaving so  yes  later mr shue  you know i hate surprises  wheres the blue bomber ii  i sold it to some kid  for a tidy little profit  let him have the fun  i made enough for a down payment on a car for our whole family  oh terri  i love you  and our little girl  and i dont want anything to distract me from you guys  hi  hi  can we be in love again  i have to tell you something first  i uh  i want us to be honest with each other no matter what  you can tell me anything  cool uh  it its not really even that big a deal  i mean i didnt actually do anything  but the other night when you were babysitting  i kind of went over to rachels house  but nothing happened  i just was worked up about us fighting  and then she put on this really weird catwoman suit  and so i think something could have happened  but it didnt  because i only want to be with you  its all right  thank you for being honest with me  i love you quinn  i love you too     hey sue you got a sec  sure  i owe you an apology  i did think the kids needed to be a little more showbiz  and i was wrong  that isnt who they are  so thank you for helping me see that  oh and uh heres the new set list  mmhmm  wow these are great choices william  proud mary  smokin hot deep cut  smokin hot  dont mock me  sorry  oh i dont recognize this last one  oh thats the new addition  yeah i want the kids to forget everything i taught them  about hairography because  were starting from scratch  grab a stool  so were a stool choir now  nope were not dancing with the stools  no gimmicks no false theatricality  were just going to sit in them and sing  thanks mr schuester  this is their set list from sectionals  dont stop believing thats in  proud mary  performed in wheelchairs thats in  now i suggest you take these two songs  split them between your two groups  and ill pull some strings  and make sure that schuester and his group perform last  that way itll look like he stole the songs  from you  um who do you think i am  thats actually a very good question  because ive forgotten both of your names  look i spend every waking hour of my day  trying to teach those girls that lying and cheating  is not the way youre ever going to get ahead  and youre suggesting i do exactly that  so that they can win a singing competition  yeah pretty much  i think youre missing an opportunity  to give your girls a second chance  these mckinley kids are going to do fine  but outside of glee club  your girls dont have a heck of a lot going for them  and id hate to see them so devastated by losing  that theyd give up entirely  you know how many deaf choirs have won this competition  okay everybodys going to need to speak up  because i cant hear  deaf in one ear scarlet fever  i assume you read lips read these  never let anything distract you from winning  ever   ah ah ah    you with the sad eyes    dont be discouraged    oh i realize its hard to take courage    in a world full of people    you can lose sight of it all    and darkness still inside you    make you feel so small    but i see your true colors shining through    i see your true colors    and thats why i love you    so dont be afraid to let them show    your true colors    true colors are beautiful    like a rainbow    show me a smile then    dont be unhappy    cant remember when    i last saw you laughing    if this world makes you crazy    and youve taken all you can bear    you call me up because you know ill be there    and i see your true colors shining through    yeah    i see your true colors and thats why i love you    so dont be afraid    afraid to let them show    your true colors    true colors    true colors    are beautiful like a rainbow
