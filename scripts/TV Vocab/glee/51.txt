                1 so heres what you missed on glee  coach beiste is head over heels for a guy  named cooter whos a football recruiter  rachels running for class president against kurt and brittany  and a guy from the hockey team  vote rick the stick  burts running for congress against sue  and reggie the sauce this guy who owns a pizza chain  and whos gonna air a commercial thatll out santana  everyones gonna know now because of you  she thought the whole thing was finns fault  so she slapped him really hard  in front of god and everybody ouch  and thats what you missed on glee   im sorry but since a student had lit firecrackers  stuffed down his pants three years ago  weve had a zero tolerance physical violence policy  is that why you suspended all the kids who have been  tossing slushees in our faces for the past two years  slushees are not on the school boards approved list  of suspendworthy weapons  heres what you have to understand i didnt do it  we all saw what happened  you slapped finn in the face unprovoked  no see you dont get it  when i get really pissed off santana gets taken over  by my other evil personality i call her snixxx  her wrath of words is called snixxx juice  im kind of like the incredible hulk  you cant blame me for anything snixxx does  im suspending you and this snixxx two weeks  no argument  sectionals is next week if you suspend me i wont be  able to beat grimace and mr shues butts  ms corcoran i highly recommend you do something about this  im sorry santana sectionals is important  but you need to be punished for what you did  i hate to say it but i agree  this is garbage  hamburglar finn is fine  she didnt slap me  i know that it looked and sounded like she did  but she actually didnt  what is it called in a play  or a movie when you pretend to hit someone but you dont  shelby a stage slap  it was a stage slap  thats what it was   what is your angle here finn  the truth  if she didnt actually hit me  then you cant suspend her right  no  then thats what happened  bell rings  im a mischievous bitch  but i cant for the life of me figure out  what the hell this is about  well i want sectionals to be a fair fight  and that cant happen without you on the trouble tones  well actually it would only be a fair fight  with me off the team  and i also kind of feel bad for you  look i know weve been at each other a lot  over these past couple of years  but the truth is i think youre awesome  and when you hide who you are  i feel like you hide  part of that awesomeness with it  and thats why you act out  because you hurt inside every day  thats sweet  but if you think that in exchange for keeping me  from getting suspended im gonna come   back to the glee club  exactly  you and all the trouble tones i have an idea  for a lesson but it wont work out if youre not there  did ms corcoran and mr shue already agree to this  look its up to you  either you can come back to the choir room  and embrace your awesome or take a twoweek vacation  and enjoy your seat in the audience for sectionals  bell ringing  rachel i havent been this worried about a vote  since lambert versus allen  kurt needs this election to get into nyada  more importantly hes clearly the superior candidate  i mean come on  if elected  i will make sure to have sugary treats available at all times  it helps the concentration  thats what george washington said  i had to take a stand  shes bribing the students with pixy stix  buying votes is illegal  its also delicious  nobody cares  theyre all so lost in their own worlds  that they cant see how important this is to me  elections have consequences  and the consequence of brittany winning this election is  that ill have to move to new york without my best gay  what if i need an emergency makeover  or a lastminute souffl  jacob hows the concession speech going  can i print an early copy on my blog  who says im ready to concede  im leading that hockey playing kid by ten percent  but thats mostly because  hes in a medically induced coma after  being brutally checked in a game last week  also youre trailing brittany by 17 points  if this was a horse race youd be glue  and te glue that keeps this school together  when he gets elected president  oh my god its brittany madam president  dont worry about it okay  we still have the rest of the day to change the minds of the voters  whats the point  im gonna lose unless i pull a jfk  hushed youre gonna shoot brittany  no no when kennedy ran against nixon in 1960  he had all his mob buddies in chicago stuff the ballot boxes  so that he would win illinois  it won him the presidency  wait no  no i cant let you do this okay  come on cant we just do like a great duet in the cafeteria  or the library to just drum up some support  i have kennedys impeccable hairline  i know  why cant i have his ends justifythemeans mentality  if i lose and my resume remains blank  im not gonna get into nyada  and i cant accept that  youre seriously considering cheating  what choice do i have  bell ringing  can someone tell us whats going on please  this week the trouble tones and new directions  will both be singing music created   by ladies and for ladies  oh hell no  next week all of us will be going to sectionals  and one of us is probably gonna win  but santana were worried about you  worry about yourself fetus face  glees about learning how to accept yourself for who you are  no matter what other people think  and thats what this music is all about  so wait i dont even get a say in this not cool  everybody in this room knows about you and brittany  and we dont judge you for it  we celebrate it because its who you are  look i know not everybody outside of this room  is as accepting and cool  but were doing this assignment this week so that you know  in this rotten stinking mean world that you at least have  a group of people who will support your choice  to be whoever you want to be  thats it  thats what were doing here  blaine kurt  santana kurt and i have a song  we like to sing to each other in the car  and we want to sing that for you right now  while theres nothing id love more than having  two pretty ponies serenade me i think wed get further  staging a gelervention for blaine than singing lady music  i know its hard it was hard for me too  but you can get through this  if you could just stop being so defensive  im trying but your hideous bow ties are provoking me  wait are we talking lady on lady or girl on girl  cause theres a big difference  puck focus okay scoffs  kurt blaine why dont you kick us off with what you got  pinks perfect begins  made a wrong turn once or twice   dug my way out blood and fire   bad decisions thats all right   welcome to my silly life

won by a suspiciously wide margin  no no ii didnt do it  i didnt cheat i mean i mean i thought about it but iii  what do you mean you thought about it  i i thought about it because iii wanted to win so badly  and i was worried that i wouldnt  but but i didnt cheat ii worked really hard on this  i didnt cheat  bell ringing  someone stuffed the ballot boxes  they think i did it  if they can prove
