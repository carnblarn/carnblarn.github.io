                 michael rennie was ill    the day the earth stood still    but he told us where we stand    and flash gordon was there    in silver underwear    claude rains was the invisible man    then something went wrong    for fay wray and king kong    they got caught in a celluloid jam    then at a deadly pace    it came from outer space    and this is how the message ran    science fiction    double feature    to the late night double feature    picture show    in the velvet darkness    of the blackest night    burning bright    theres a guiding star    no matter what    or who    who you are    theres a light    over at the frankenstein place    theres a light    burning in the fireplace    theres a light    light in the darkness    of everybody   schuester you messing with my woman  i i thought we had a deal  this is the face of a guy who stepped in it  how did it get to this  how did a production of rocky horror turn into  ughmy horror  it all started a week ago  hey em hi  whats with your crusts  youyou always cut them off  i must have forgotten this morning  forgot  carl and i had the most amazing weekend  we hit the revival theater  downtown for the midnight show of rocky horror  youre kidding  no  isnt that where everyone dresses up and yells stuff  yes yeah  i mean well we dont dress up  at least not yet  wait isnt that theater a total dive  its disgusting its horrible  i know i mean there isnt  a surface that isnt  covered in spilled soda so youd think  itd be a nightmare for me right  but i dont know im having so much fun  that i dont even notice  mm and get this  you know how ive always been  very antihalloween  cause it totally freaks me out to think about eating candy  that someone else has touched right  well carl and i are gonna dress up as characters  from the show and were actually gonna  go trickortreating  the sandwich  the dirty theater hes actually making her better  go as janet because obviously  shes a ginger hes winning  why the hell didnt i think of taking her to that damn show  oh its so weird  that you brought up how much you love that show  because just last weekend  i decided to have the glee club perform rocky horror  for the school musical this year  wow will yeah  cool right its very very cool  thats so i mean  who knew that rocky horror was so important to both of us  yeah yeah i guess so  isnt there some pretty risqu material  in there though  yeah i mean ill probably have to  make some edits here and there  but its worth it to expose the kids to  one of my favorite musicals of all time  yeah i love that show  wow yeah mm  well im thinking youre gonna have to edit the whole thing out  if youre gonna get sue and figgins to sign off on it  but um thats really exciting  right  lets go rocky horror  oh um yep yeah  so what are you gonna be for halloween this year  im going as a peanut allergy  great news guys  ive had a little inspiration  this weeks musical lesson isnt really a lesson  its a musical  oh please be evita please be evita  rocky horror  ive never seen it  mr shue yep  while i admire your choice  of the groundbreaking 70s musical  arent you worried that the adult themes  might be a point of controversy  seriously a school in texas couldnt even do rent  it caused an outrage and they had to cancel the show  isnt that the whole point of the arts  pushing boundaries doing things  people say you cant do for the sake of  selfexpression  i got it all figured out  i cut out some of the more risqu sections  and im sending home permission slips  to all your parents to make sure that theyre okay with it  and were going to charge admission and use the proceeds  to help pay for transportation  to nationals in new york  okay lets talk about casting  oh finn and i will play brad and janet  ah and ill be playing  the guy in the wheelchair right  thats what i was thinking  and i thought kurt could play  the role of franknfurter  no theres no way  im playing a transvestite in high heels and fishnets  and wearing lipstick  why cause that look was last season  ill do it  really  its like the male lead  i know but im feeling a little more confident  about my singing voice after our duets project  great i have no problem with that  now were a little short on female roles  so were going to have to double up on columbias and magentas  its standard practice on broadway  itll preserve your voices  id like to preserve you  in a jar  in my basement  sam  id like you to play the role of the creature  from the black lagoon  rocky hes like the frankenstein character  but blond youll kill the part  hes cute just like you  better start working on those abs  are you kidding me you could cut glass with these babies  i have no problem showing off my body  okay looks like we got ourselves a show  so then after the time warp riff raff aka kurt  takes us to franknfurters lab  i have no idea whats going on in this script  and its not in a cool inception kind of way  just try okay  all right so then they take off our wet clothes  and we do the rest of the scene in our underwear  wait im in my tightywhities  yeah  i cant be on stage  in front of the whole school  in my tightywhities theyre  gonna be able to see my whole  business  come on it will just be like going to the pool  i wear a swim shirt at the pool  i tell everybody its because i burn easily but  look i know im a big athlete  and its not manly or anything  but im kind of insecure about how i look  come on you just  you know you have a different body type  i dont look like brittany or santana  but you still think im hot right  yeah of course  so then  youre just going to have to trust me  that youre the hottest guy in school  okay  okay come her  all right  so then after that  franknfurters going to come down  and elevator and when he comes down  we are scared  i might faint maybe a couple times  making it the zoos first  unitarian chimp wedding in over six years  and we certainly wish the couple well  and now lets mosey on over to sues corner  take it away sue  thanks   you know halloween is fast approaching  the day when parents encourage little boys  to dress like little girls  and little girls to dress like whores  and go doortodoor browbeating hardworking americans  into giving them free food  well you know what western ohio  weve lost the true meaning of halloween  fear  halloween is that magical day of the year  when a child is told their grandmothers a demon  whos been feeding them rat casserole  with a crunchy garnish of their own scabs  children must know fear  without it they wont know how to behave  theyll try frenching grizzly bears  or consider living in florida  so moms skip trickortreating this year  and instead sit your little toddler down and explain  that daddys a hungry zombie  and before he went out to sharpen his pitchfork  he whispered to mommy that you looked delicious  and thats how sue sees it  sue youre the cats pajamas  and well be right back  hello sue im barry jeffries  this is tim stanwick  were the new local station managers down at wohn  do you mind if we sit  we loved sues corner last night  oh yeah you know  we come from the world of cable news  and we have ideas  you see good news is about information  but great news is about fear  for example tim hmm  did you hear about the swarm of africanized killer bees  no wouldnt it be awful  to see an entire town overrun  by killer bees  im sorry did you just say tim  an entire town overrun by killer bees  well i ju theres your quote  and you can replace killer bees  with whatever you want terrorists  mexicans  mexican terrorists  ants  mexican terrorist ants  so what can i do for you  someone at this school is seeking the stage rights  to rocky horror as this years musical  i take it you know the show  when i was younger i took my sister to the show  the audience was so enraged  at having a disabled person in their midst  you know what they did  they threw toast at us  you want me to shut it down  no no  we want you to do an expos proving that the secular  progressive agenda has finally arrived here  in the lima ohio school district  sue its got a local emmy written all over it  we have a deal  all right places finn and rachel  i want to start with damn it janet  oh i cannot wait till  finn takes his top off so we can all see the hotness underneath  what are you talking about you cant have sloppy joes  every day for lunch and think you can get away with it  um thats incredibly rude  is it guys whisper behind our backs  about how we girls look every day  they objectify us all the time  he sort of has a point yeah earlier today  artie asked if he could make a gigantic omelet  when im done with the ostrich eggs im smuggling in my bra  im super looking forward to seeing sam in his gold bikini  its gonna be abulous  can we get on with rehearsal please yeah  i agree yes  lets stay focused guys all right  riff raff and columbia and magenta team one  take your places  lets rock and roll  hey janet  yes brad  ive got something to say  i really loved the  skillful way  you beat the other girls  to the brides bouquet  oh brad   the river was deep but i swam it janet    the future is ours so lets plan it janet    so please dont tell me to can it janet    ive one thing to say    and thats damn it janet i love you    the road was long but i ran it janet    theres a fire in my heart and you fan it janet    if theres one fool for you then i am it janet    ive one thing to say    and thats damn it janet i love you    heres a ring to prove that im no joker    theres three ways that love can grow    thats good bad or mediocre    oh janet i love you so    its nicer than betty munroe had   oh brad    now were engaged and im so glad oh brad    that youve met mom and you know dad oh brad    ive one thing to say    and thats brad im mad for you too   what made you think  you could get away with doing this show without my knowledge  i didnt i was hoping just to run out the clock  until it was too late to stop us  who says i want to stop you  i appreciate how rocky horror pushes boundaries  so youre not gonna fight us  perhaps not  i just want to be involved will  the arts matter  fine join us  play the part of the criminologist  we need someone with authority  done great  we rehearse tonight  fantastic give me time to do my rewrites  im sorry yeah it says right here in my contract  that i get final script approval  and i wouldnt fight it will  im a notary public see you on the boards buddy   chicken egg whites fish no salmon  oatmeal brown rice but not after 600 pm  no butter or oil and no soda  thats all you eat  aint no carpool lane to sexy  damn straight  i dont know man i never used to think about this stuff  i mean were guys  when did this start to matter  i personally blame the internet  once internet porn was invented girls could watch without having  to make that embarrassing trip to the video store  internet porn altered  the female brain chemistry  making them more like men  and thus more concerned with our bodies  but doesnt it get exhausting thinking about what you eat  like working out like a madman nah  i mean if i miss a workout or eat a hot dog i hate myself  for a few days but the fact is  if i want to be cool if i want to get quinn for good  i got to look the part  you get up on that stage and look like  the pillsbury doughboy no way youre staying popular  come on lets do some squats  i think maybe thats why sues been such a bully all along  she really just wants to be included  listen  i really dont want to  overstep my boundaries here but i really need your help  ii need to find all these costumes  and nobody knows rocky horror like you  i dont know would you  mind coming on board as my costume designer  are you serious youre not kidding  i would love to id love to  well its gonna be a lot of work  and were gonna be spending a lot of time together  yes its a dream come true  i

gosh were failing and uh you know  when the kids dont have arts they turn to drugs and  with drugs comes tooth loss and  are you ready for a chilling statistic  this school are wooden  seventy percent  is there anything i can do to help  i dont understand  well you guys have a hole to fill  and im just trying to help fill it  wanky santana  well you know i cant just give you a role  youd have to try out  fair enough but ill need a lady to sing to  ems  okay  hot patootie bflat   whatever happened to saturday night    when you dressed up sharp and you felt all right    it dont seem the same since cosmic light    came into my life i thought i was divine    i used to go for a ride with a chick whod go    and listen to the music on the radio    a saxophone was blowin on a rock and roll show

right  you want to play in our sandbox sing a franknfurter number  well im sorry bro but i think its fine to wear  that frankie bustier in the privacy of your own home  im freaky like that but dont you think its a little  inappropriate in a high school musical i mean at least if i  play eddie i wont have to grind up against the students  you know eddies an important role  if i did it id be showing my support for the arts  are you telling me how to direct my show  will will  mr shue  id like to play franknfurter  i was rereading the script yesterday and it said  dont dream it be it  and its my dream to play a lead role  so i figure why not me  i mean id be all kind of crazy sexy in that outfit  and i can reinterpret the  number a little bit make it more modern  id really like the chance mr shue  well there you go will you killed two birds  with one stone here today congratulations  look you got yourself a franknfurter  and an eddie  this is outstanding  you ready for our first dress rehearsal mmhmm  okay guys places  uh mr shue  uh i know im supposed to be  in my underwear for this scene and im totally down with that  i thought maybe i would save it for the opening if thats okay  um also miss pillsbury is there  a way i could  wear like some gold board shorts or something  these are really short  im afraid im gonna show off some nuttage  well well take a note  we cant stop guys  its a dress rehearsal  come on keep going  and  action  oh brad lets get out of here  im cold im wet and im just plain scared  well im here  theres nothing to worry about   how do you do i    see you met my    faithful handyman    hes just a little broke down    cause wouldnt you know    he thought you were the candy man    dont get strung out    by the way i look    dont judge a book by its cover    im not much of a girl    by the light of day    but by night im one hell of a lover    im just a sweet transvestite    from sin sational    transylvania    why dont you stay for the night   night   or maybe a bite   bite   i could show you my favorite obsession    ive been making a man    with blond hair and a tan    and hes good for relieving my tension    im just a sweet transvestite    a sweet transvestite    from sin sational    transylvania    hey hey    im just a sweet transvestite    a sweet transvestite    from sin sational    transylvania   so come up to the lab  and see whats on the slab  i see you shiver with antici  pation pation   but maybe the rain    isnt really to blame    so ill remove the cause    but not the symptom   now thats an entrance  mr director i take that wall out right  youre two acts early carl  youre supposed to bust through  the dinner party scene  oh well actually  i was sort of feeling my entrance in this scene  such good good interesting impulses  emma oh  bravo carl bravo  will  hey i got your note you wanted to see me  we have a problem with the show  its carl  really  i thought he was perfect  i agree but uh  what he said during his audition  itsitsitsits haunted me  hes right  some of these parts are just too adult for kids to play  oh yeah well i have to agree will  you know especially sam  sam right  he seems so uncomfortable  i know i yeah  so i spoke with him  is there something wrong with my body  your bodys fine sam  but frankly i think the roles  a little too risqu for a student  i did feel kind of embarrassed  whos gonna play rocky  uh i guess i have to  imim sorry  i figured if carl can play eddie then  i can play rocky hmm  thing is im not as familiar  with the libretto as you are  and i can really use your help rehearsing  uh im areare you sure thats a good idea  i mean youll be a great rocky  you look really really great hhealthy  but i mean youre a teacher  which is why i should do it  it will give the show a little more credibility you know  oh  so think you could help me out  i mean i have to have toucha touch me  down by rehearsal tomorrow  yeah okay  okay  um well i guess  if you want to start over there  and i will start here  right good good good good good  so lets just uh just imagine  that were all alone in franknfurters laboratory  alone okay   i was feeling done in    couldnt win    id only ever kissed before   you mean she uhhuh   i felt theres no use getting    into heavy sweating    it only leads to trouble and    bad fretting    now all i want to know    is

anymore  youre kidding who is  mr shue  i totally blew this  i shouldnt have made all those demands about my costume  i just feel i feel fat  like i had rolls hanging over those gold shorts  but youre in perfect shape dude  wait since i said  im uncomfortable in the tightywhities  does that mean im gonna get replaced next  no you dont have to worry about that  the brad part isnt about looking hot  its about being confident in who you are and how you look  no matter how douchey you are  thats guys totally cool being uncool  yeah im definitely not there  i actually started showering with my shirt on  look stop knocking yourself out in here  just be you and the sexy will flow through  yeah  yeah youre right  i dont need to hide behind my muscles like you do  awesome  i think  are you insulting me  where are you going  to show everyone how hot and sexy i am  oh wow  damn those cool ranch doritos  eddie ive seen him  eddie  what do you know of eddie dr scott  i happen to know a great deal  about a lot of things  you see  eddie happens to be my nephew  this play is terrible  finns line dr scott  janet  dr scott will finns line janet  im so bored i just fell into a microsleep  brad rocky  janet dr scott  still being finn janet  brad none of this is plausible  rocky  janet dr scott  finns line janet brad  rocky  this play has incredible pacing problems  mr shue it is pointless  to rehearse this scene without finn  we dont have a choice  hes late and hes not answering his phone  we gotta get this timing down guys  and would you please stop interjecting your opinions sue  opinions these are my rewrites  william id like to see you in my office please  suspended for what  i sort of walked down the hall in my rocky horror costume  whoa nice panties baby huey  hey my grandpa murray called  he wants his boxers back  why would you do that  i was trying to get comfortable in my costume  you dont understand how hard it is for us guys  to be exposed like that  just thought maybe it would make me feel hot enough  to get up on stage and sing in my underwear  im recommending one months suspension  and summer school to make up for any lost class time  can we have a moment alone please  you cant do this to him  he was just coming to rehearsal in his costume  thats not a crime  nine children have already signed up  for afterschool therapy  i had to bring in a grief counselor  last year when the cheerios won the national championship  santana pantsed brittany  and she was wearing a lot less than her underwear  neither of them were suspended  that was in the middle of a celebration  but theres still a precedent  huh  fine a warning  thank you  william  to be honest  your motivations for doing this production are murky to me  considering all that youre risking  if something goes too far  what are you saying  im saying that youre welcome to continue with this  but if you get any heat about it  i wont be able to protect you  youre putting you and your glee club  on the line and i want you to be sure  that whatever youre doing it for is worth it  finn  rachel theres a   whoa whoa whoa whoa  schuester you messing with my woman  i thought we had a deal  i uh  iii dont know what youre talking about  yes you do  because emma and i have  a full disclosure policy total honesty  something that allows us to have a little thing  i like to call intimacy  something you clearly know nothing about  look we were just rehearsing  stop it bro  mantoman you gave me your word  so what you quitting the show  no no no no  unlike you i believe in the power of the arts  i dont just use them to pick up other guys chicks  trick or treat  oh geez becky i forgot that take back the night club  was going doortodoor this evening  i want my chocolate bar  im sorry  ive been working so hard on rocky horror  i forgot to buy candy  rocky horror is an abomination  what did you just say  thats what coach sue says on her tape  its in her office ill show you  so i went undercover to expose  what your tax dollars are funding in our public schools  in the name of the arts  now im all about personal freedom  ive publicly voiced my support  for that lady who wants to marry her own sores  but just because youre free to say whatever you want  doesnt always mean you should  artists are free to push boundaries to make art  but when pushing boundaries is their only aim  the result is usually bad art  theres a time and a place for everything  and squeamishness about what  we want our children exposed to is not the same as bigotry  freedomloving adults are free to have an open  lively debate about what we want our society to be  but lets not make our children fight the culture war for us  they deserve a little bit better than that  and thats how sue sees it  give me chocolate or i will cut you  sue you set me up  hey there william  root through anyones personal belongings lately  when were you planning on airing that  opening night thats why i pretaped it  oh i know youre furious will  but do you honestly believe  anything i said was unreasonable  well  no  there are limits will there is a line  and for reasons i suspect have nothing to do with your kids  you crossed it  you cant yell fire  in a crowded theatre and you cant expose kids  to material like this  not on the taxpayers dime  oh please sue  they have the internet they are exposed  dont lead them to it  dont make it okay theyre kids  and now more than ever high school is  a dangerous place and its our job  to guide them through it safely  and we still get to torture them along the way  its a fabulous system  youre right  iim pulling the show  wait what  im canceling the show  you were right i was totally wrong  well shouldnt you wait until opening night  i mean the kids worked so hard sorry sue  hey do it for the kids will  i need that local emmy will  are you sure you want to cancel the whole thing  i never shouldve tried to put it on in the first place  the reality is  i only did all this to get close to you  i guess love can make you do some crazy things  you know  im sorry emma  and i promise to never abuse our feelings for each other again  i mean lets face it  carls actually making you better  and if i really love you  i need to back off and accept the fact that  at least for now  being with him  is the best thing for you  so what are you going to tell the kids  i want to apologize  for putting you guys through all this  particularly finn and sam  its cool mr shue  im sure the teasing will die down  by the time my tenth reunion rolls around  and i got asked to be june  in the men of mckinley high calendar  im happy for you  but we still cant do the musical  look i was wrong  rocky horror isnt  about pushing boundaries or making an audience accept  a certain rebellious point of view  those were my reasons for doing it  and they arent worth risking what we have here for  and when i was younger  and they started midnight shows of rocky horror  it wasnt for envelope pushers  it was for outcasts  people on the fringes who had no place  left to go but were searching for someplace  anyplace where they felt like they belonged  sound familiar  the truth is with that perspective  rocky horror is the perfect show for this club  well then why arent we putting it on  were still going to perform rocky horror  were just not doing it for an audience  were doing it for ourselves  its astounding  time is fleeting  madness takes its toll  but listen closely  not for very much longer  ive got to keep control   i remember doing the timewarp    drinking those moments when    the blackness would hit me   and a void would be calling    lets do the timewarp again    lets do the timewarp again   its just a jump to the left   and then a step to the right   put your hands on your hips   you bring your knees in tight   that really drives you insane    lets do the timewarp again    lets do the timewarp again    its so dreamy    oh fantasy free me    so you cant see me no not at all    in another dimension    with voyeuristic intentions    well secluded oh i see it all   with a bit of a mind flip  youre into the time slip  and nothing can ever be the same   youre spaced out on sensation ow    like youre under sedation    lets do the timewarp again    lets do the timewarp again    well i was walking down the street just ahaving a think    when this snake of a guy gave me an evil wink    he shook me up he took me by surprise    he had a pickup truck and the devils eyes    he stared at me and i felt a change    time meant nothing never would again    lets do the timewarp again    lets do the timewarp again   its just a jump to the left   and then a step to the right   put your hands on your hips   you bring your knees in tight    but its the pelvic thrust  that really drives you insane    lets do the timewarp again    lets do the timewarp again
