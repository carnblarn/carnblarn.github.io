theyre still capable of making beautiful music  will right so mr motta as a lover of the arts  agreed to donate them to glee  i fixed them up  painted them purple  and the purple piano project was born  now im going to be placing these grapey uprights randomly  throughout the school and whenever you see one  no matter what youre doing  i want you to sing a song  now use this assignment to attract kids  who are just like you  kids who cant keep the music inside  those are the kinds of additions  that we need to win it all this year  sighs now for many of you  this is your last year

from  thats really offensive  you know i was really humbled when your glee club  made my sisters funeral so very touching  in fact i was so moved that i have spent the entire year  being nothing but kind to you people  todays only the second day of school  you have no right to disturb the learning environment  of this school by playing your jangly national anthem  on liberaces piano  thank you  youre welcome  i have no idea who you are  im nancy bletheim  i teach geometry  ive been teaching here for 42 years  so awkward  those artsy kids they think  they can get away with anything  people who call themselves artists  think the rules dont apply to them  its so arrogant  bless you sue sylvester  you got my vote  youre quiet  no im being passiveaggressive  you promised that by the first day of school  youd make a decision  and yet there you sit cute as ever  but still in your warblers blazer  i cant just bail on the warblers  those guys are my friends  okay all right fine  one final sales pitch  and then we can talk about making over nancy grace  okay  if you stay at dalton  you and i are competitors  thats true  and im just not sure  that our budding love can survive that  let

 yeah come on quinn  you know we used to be like the three musketeers  and now santana and i are like almond joy  and youre like a jolly rancher that fell in the ashtray  you guys never understood the pressure i was under  it sucked  im not interested in the boys  or the makeup or the polyester outfits  look ive got a bar of soap and a bottle of peroxide  with your name on it in my locker  come on quinn you cant break up the unholy trinity  people grow apart  deal with it  ive got new friends now and they accept me for who i am  quinn we call ourselves the skanks  im sheila  im ronnie  they call me the mack  because i like to make out with truckers at the rest stop  its kind of a double meaning thing  i once ate cat poo  rachel hey quinn  hello skanks  your friend stinks of soap quinn  we were friends once  okay and maybe when you cut off  all your hair last year and thought it  would solve all your problems i should have spoken up  maybe when you dropped out  of society this summer and started dating  that 40yearold skateboarder i should have said  im not coming back to glee club  we need you oookay  have you seen thosethose purple pianos around school  were planning this this big you know recruiting number  and its going to be a tribute to the gogos  i mean who doesnt love the gogos  i prefer the bangles  okay  we need your  your tremulous alto and your belinda carlisle glamour  ill give you ten bucks if you let me  beat her up for you quinn  im sorry youre so sad quinn  and maybe youre not going to believe me  because we were never really close  but im sad not seeing you in the choir room  and weve all been through so much together  were a family and this is our year to get it right  we would love to have you back in the glee club  whenever youre ready  okay  making it the zoos bloodiest weekend  in over six years  thats what i call pandamonium  now lets hitch a ride over to sues corner  with congressional candidate sue sylvester  take it away sue  whistle blows  western ohio ever since the start of my campaign  to replace ken my heart stopped beating and i died weigand  ive been trying to be positive  well you know what fourth congressional district  unless its a day shes being screened for hepatitis  this gals not positive  and you know whats getting me down western ohio  the arts in public schools  why because america is failing  china is on our ass people  this isnt the 1960s anymore when jobs were plentiful  and its not personal will schuester  the arts are expensive and we cant afford it anymore  thats why tonight  im making a pledge fourth congressional district  if you honor me by electing me your representative  i will suspend all public school arts programs  and reject all youve got to be kidding me  federal and state funding for the arts  until every single student reads at or above grade level  until then parents  if youd like your teenager  to join the glee club or play a doorman  in a boring fourhour play about what its like  to be a middleaged gay new yorker  feel free to pay for it yourself  but until ohios kids  can compete again it wont be on the taxpayer dime  and thats how sue sees it    she cant do this  william its important you dont take this so personally  first of all sue you ruined a piece  of private property allegedly  also you got your facts all wrong  the arts help kids do better in school  kids in the arts record the lowest instance  of substance abuse  tell that to janis joplin  so you see sue i do take this personally  youre not just threatening an arts program  youre threatening my livelihood  i need job security  im in a relationship now  iim im thinking about starting a family  oh how is it going with emma  im sure everything in the bedroom  is just completely normal  yes  no its so frustrating  i get the green light and then the  the red light comes just as quickly william  allow me to ladle you  a piping hot bowl of this is how it is  im done squabbling with you okay  im on the national stage  in the whitehot stare of the public eye  you know ever since my sues corner last night  ive made tremendous gains in the polls  and im neck and neck  with that rapist running from prison  so i got bigger fish to fry  than you and your little glee club  so truce for now macaroni hair  oh and william  just know if you do anything to derail  my bullet train to power ill destroy you  bell ringing  ladies i put plastic on your chairs  in anticipation of this announcement  so feel free to wet yourselves with excitement  you are my cheerio cocaptains  what wait cocaptains  with no no way uhuh  i cant work with her  nah nah nah see let me tell you how this  gon be if i may  when i look at a person  i dont see someone who looks a certain way  or has this or that amount of chromosomes  i just see someone  who i may or may not have to destroy  so if you ever tell me  what to do i will end you  bring it sandbags  ladies i am aroused  however we have a more pressing issue at hand  there are purple pianos polluting this school  and i will seem weak  if it appears i cannot control my own workspace  i want you to track down those pianos take care of them  snaps fingers make it look like an accident  santana you like playing both sides  isnt that right  what team you playing for this year  losers or the winners  team sue  glad to hear it  why are you guys ignoring mr schuesters assignment  wait is there  a purple piano in here  wow how did any of us miss that  okay we have to do the number  okay  we have to survive lunch  its not fair that mr shue put the piano in here  its too much pressure  i agree that is like wearing a red dress to a bullfight  the point of the assignment was to find people  who couldnt help but join okay  the more people that we sing in front of  the more chances we have of getting one  okay its simple mathematics  which i stopped attending years ago  no no hold on rachels right  hows anyone supposed to believe  we can go to nationals if we  dont even believe in ourselves  thank you  the gogos we got the beat begins  see the people walking down the street   fall in line just watching all their feet   they dont

mr shue if you are trying to break us down  to rebuild us its working  not one single person was inspired  by our hot lunch jam to try out mr shue  girl its true  you guys sucked ass  im sorry and you are  im sugar motta  and i have selfdiagnosed aspergers  so i can pretty much say whatever i want  im like a diplomats daughter  how can we help you sugar  heres the deal  im awesome and i want to be a big big star  and when i saw you guys singing and dancing  in the cafeteria i thought  i am so much better than you  sorry aspergers  well great  you see guys  you have inspired an audition  good job gloved applause  will sugar why dont you show us what you can do  you know take your time whenever youre ready  sugar motta  why does that name sound familiar  oh her daddys the rich dude  that donated the purple pianos  get ready to taste some sweet ear candy  hit it hottie  big spender begins  outrageously offkey the minute you walked in the joint   i could see you were a man of distinction   a real big spender   goodlooking so refined   wouldnt you like to know whats going on in my mind   her ears should get to park in my handicapped spot  hey big spender   spend oh   a little time   with me   yeah   holy sh sugar  text me re our rehearsal skedge  of course  mr shue stop speaking  okay  uh sugar  well be in touch  thank you bye  okay i think i speak for everyone when i say  never gonna happen  guys i know she was a little rough  but we have always had the policy  that anyone who tries out gets in  youre not doing her any good  sheltering sugar from the truth okay  high school is where you learn survival of the fittest  shes going to drag the new directions down  and thats not fair for those of us  who dont want to spend our lives  rotting in this insignificant town  you said the other day  that you would do anything to get us to nationals  okay and she is going to keep us  from winning that elusive crown  if anything shes going to kill all of our chances  bell ringing  will i just cant look a kid in the eye and say  youre not good enough to be in glee club  was she that bad  sugar motta was just awful  i mean i have never seen someone  with so little musical talent  but that shouldnt have anything to do with being  a part of a club  so make her water boy or mascot or something  thats what i do with my hardest luck cases  you know how many guys i cut last week 60  and all of them with big dreams  and i crushed em  like pigs in a blanket squealing  how i mean doesnt that just eat you up  of course  but its my job to put the guys i take  in the best position to win  its the same as you  the arts are different than football  you win nationals this year  youre buying that glee club ten more years  emma curve ball  so you just passed undecided  and anyone white in the polls  it looks like our antiarts platform is actually working  maybe i should rough her up a little bit  go all deliverance on her or something huh  will no  this is my fight  its my program she wants to cut  and my kids  what are you going to do  something i should have done a long time ago  sue wants to declare war on the arts  well general schuester is about to launch a counteroffensive  so this is what being turned on feels like  bell rings  it all seems so hopelessly provincial now  i mean once youve performed on the stage  of the gershwin theatre and felt the lights of broadway  on your face for the first time  nothing else compares  whats the purple piano doing here  well i commandeered it  to help us get ready for our nyada mixer  whatever rejects show up at that place  are gonna be expecting  pepperidge farm cookies and punch  not velma and roxie  we need to intimidate those wannabes  into never wanting to audition against us genius  wicked again no  before there was wicked there was  gasps dont even finish that sentence  hit it  jazz version of ding dong the witch is dead begins  once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of oz   and a wickeder wickeder wickeder witch   there never ever was   she filled the folks in munchkinland   with terror and with dread   till one fine day from kansas   a house fell on her head   and the coroner

grain of this glitter represents a kid  whose dream wont come true if you get elected  and end school arts programs  john f kennedy once said  the arts are the roots of our culture  the arts enrich our lives and help kids achieve  in all walks of life  sue sylvester  you just got glitterbombed  you get that mmhmm  okay come on come on  becky i need the two of you to escort me  to my hyperbaric

anger  which could lead to a horrible horrible nasty breakup  like you know on the bachelorette  when we watched that  hey i came here for me  because i cant stand to be apart from the person i love  well i guess well just have to find a way  to ease you into the new directions now huh  ive already have that figured out  tom jones its not unusual begins  its not unusual to be loved by anyone   its not unusual to have fun with anyone   but when i see you hanging about with anyone   its not unusual to see me cry   i wanna die   its not unusual to go out at any time   but when i see you out and about its such a crime   if you should ever want to be loved by anyone   its not unusual   it happens every day   no matter what you say   you find it happens all the time   love will never do   what you want it to   why cant this crazy love be mine   its not unusual to be mad with anyone   its not unusual to be sad with anyone   but if i ever find that youve changed at any time   its not unusual to find out im in love with you   whoawhoawhoa ohohoh   whoawhoa whoaoh   whoawhoa ohohohoh   whoawhoa   song ends  applause    okay so youre gonna set up the props  ill plug in the boombox  and well

controversial show for our school musical  wait for it  west side story  is that the one with the cats  and it just so happens to have  a lead role that showcases  my talent and essence perfectly maria  mercedes for which there will be  open auditions right  because mercedes is feeling extremely pretty this year  kurt you had something too right  kurt hummel is wading into  mckinley highs

is done   so im gonna shake and shimmy it   and have some fun today   cause you cant stop   the motion of the ocean or the rain from above   you can try to stop the paradise were dreaming of   but you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay   you cant stop the beat   you cant stop the beat   you cant stop the beat   you cant stop the beat   you cant stop the beat   yeah yeah   song
