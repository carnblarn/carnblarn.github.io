over glee club  you want to captain the titanic too  i think i can make it great again  there is no joy in these kids  they feel invisible  thats why every one of them has a myspace page   thats what i need to keep this program up  and youyou expect me to pay it  im certainly not going to pay for it  were not talking about cheerios here will  they were on fox sports net last year  when glee club starts bringing that kind of prestige to the school again  you can have all the money you want  until then 60 bucks a month  and youve got to use the costumes and props you already have  but we need the stools for wood shop  hiding the 60 a mon fromy wife terri was going to be hard  but i had a bigger problem  how was i going to get these kids motivated  one thing i knew for sure we needed a new

cellophane    shouldve been my name mr llophane    cause you can look right through me    walk right by me    and never know im there    never even    know   im there   tina c  i kissed a girl   its not what im used to    just wanna try you on    im curious for you    caught my attention    i kissed a girl    and i liked it   hi my name is rachel berry  and ill be singing on my own  from the seminal broadway classic les miz  fantastic lets hear it   on my own    pretending hes bid   you might laugh because every time i sign my name  i put a gold star after it  but its a metaphor and metaphors are important  my gold stars are a metaphor for me being a star  and just so were clear  i want to clear up that hateful rumor that i was the one who turned  that closet case sandy ryerson in  because he gave hank saunders the solo i deserved  thats cockpoopie  he was touching hank caressing him  it was so wrong  i am not homophobic  in fact i have two gay dads  see i was born out of love  my two dads screened potential surrogates  based on beauty and iq  then they mixed their sperm together and used a turkey baster  to this day we dont know which one is my real dad  which i think is pretty amazing  my dads spoiled me in the arts  i was given dance lessons vocal lessons  anything to give me a competitive edge  you might think that all the boys in school would totally want to tap this  but my myspace schedule keeps me way too busy to date  i try to post a myspace video every day  just to keep my talent alive and growing   without him the world   nowadays being anonymous is worse than being poor  fame is the most important thing in our culture now  and if theres one thing ive learned  its that no ones just gonna hand it to you   i love him    but every day    im learning    all my life    ive only been pretending    without me his world will go on turning    a world thats full of happiness    that i have never known    i love him    i love him    i love him    but only on my    own   very nice rachel  when do we start rehearsals   and i said to myself    sit down   said to myself sit down    sit down youre rocking the boat    i said to myself sit down    said

wheelchair  i think mr shue  is using irony to enhance the performance  there is nothing ironic about show choir  rachel  rachel  thats sloppy  youre sloppy babies  its just disgraceful  and i want the agony out of your eyes  uhuh lance dont you starcrying  you are the weak link pal  hows it feel to be the weak link huh  that cant feel very good  you changed out of your costume  im tired of being laughed at  youre the best kid in there rachel  that comes with a price  look i know im just a sophomore but i can feel the clock ticking away  and i dont want to leave high school with nothing to show for it  you get great grades  youre a fantastic singer  everybody hates me  and you think glee club is going to ange that  being great at something is going to change it  being a part of something special mas you special right  i need a male lead who can keep up with me vocally  maybe i can coach arty a little  look mr shue i really appreciate what youre trying to do  but if you cant give me what i need then im sorry  im not going to make a fool out of myself  i cant keep wasting my time with glee  it hurts too much  schuester  figgins wants you  but we just started rehearsals  my hands are tied shue  i need the auditorium  alcoholics anonymous wants to rent it out for their afternoon meetings  lots of drunks in this town  theyre paying me ten bucks a head  if we show at regionals glee stays if not the bars open  what is it with you and this club  youve got only five kids one of thems a cripple  then i guess youve got nothing to worry about  fine  yes  but youre running detention for free to make it up to me  deal  you put your hands in the corners like this  okay  i cant do it  im dyslexic  maybe i should just stick to towels and washcloths  howard if you

cheerios about joining glee club  well i need more kids performers  and all the best ones are in the cheerios  so i figured some of them might want to double up  okay so what youre doing right now is called blurring the lines  high school is a caste system  kids fall into certain slots  your jocks and your popular kids up in the penthouse  the invibles and the kids playing liveaction  out in the forest bottom floor  and where do the glee kids lie  subbasement  sues not wrong but i dont think anything is set in stone  i mean you know kids are going to do what they think is cool  which is not always who they are  you just need to find a way to get them out of their boxes  well how do i do that  they follow the leader  you know if you can get a couple of the popular kids  to sign up the rest will fall right in line  i just want to talk to them  i dont know dude  i cant see any of my guys wanting to join  last month they held down one of their teammates  shaved off his eyebrows just because he watched greys anatomy  look all im looking for is an introduction  fine  you got to put a good word in for me with emma  there you go cinderella  thank you  i have trouble with things like that the um  the the messy things  yeah  its really nice how much you care about glee  about the kids  if you really care about these kids  youll leave well enough alone  children like to know where they stand  so let your little glee kids have their little club  but dont pretend that any of them are something theyre not  circle up  mr schuester is going to talk to you  if you dont listen you do laps  you mouth off you do laps  got it  theyre all yours will  thanks ken  hey guys how you doing  uh i think i recognize some of you from spanish class but  uh im  im here today to talk to you about
