                1 so heres what you missed on glee  the glee clubs getting ready for nationals  and quinns getting ready to be prom queen  we need to get elected for prom king and queen  its the ultimate status symbol  kurt had to leave mckinley  because karofsky threatened him  i cant expel a kid for shoving  hell just say i didnt mean  to shove that kid i tripped  excuse works like a charm i use it all the time  but at least hes got blaine and the warblers  who just lost at regionals to the new directions  we got each other out of all this  that beats a lousy trophy dont you think  santanas got it bad for brittany  this relationship is really confusing for me  breakfast is confusing for you  well sometimes its sweet and sometimes its salty  like what if i have eggs for dinner then what is it  wills sort of always had it bad for emma  but lately shes gotten super crazy  with the cleaning fruit and stuff  im not following like seriously crazy  one day youre going to find a way to beat this thing  and thats what you missed on glee  all right guys  nationals are just a few weeks away  and its time to bear down  now your singing at regionals was amazing but your dancing  its booty camp time  booty so lets get it going  five six seven eight  piano plays loser like me  push yourselves guys  vocal adrenaline takes no prisoners  oh im so sorry  are you okay  im bleeding  lets get you to a doctor  my dads will be here in 15 minutes  you dont have to stay finn  no i want to wait and hear what the doctor says  i feel terrible  wont quinn be mad at you sitting vigil at my bedside  well im standing  andand shed understand how awful i feel  even if its not broken  its broken  well i knew i was a bad dancer  but i never thought my dancing was dangerous  its a clean break so ii wont have to set it  considering your deviated septum  id consider this a terrific opportunity  for a little vanity adjustment  are you suggesting that i get a nose job  youre 16 right  thats when i gave my daughters theirs  its like a right of passage for jewish girls  first of all i like how i look  she your girlfriend  no  what does your girlfriend look like  okay and second of all i dont want to do anything  thats going to affect my voice  my broadway career depends on it  yeah we got a big show choir  competition coming up and rachels  kind of our best singer  doesnt impact the voice  thats just a myth  the fact is opening up that septum  might allow you to take in more air per breath  which means bigger belts on you high notes  but barbra  is great shes also one in a million  the fact is if you really want to be an actress  you might want to consider looking and sounding  the best that you can  i got an appointment open next week  can i sign you up   oh my god youre getting a nose job  im considering having a minor procedure  to repair my deviated septum  so a nose job  look im im happy with the way that i look okay  and ive embraced my nose  but lets say i wanted to have a slightly more demure nose  like quinns for example  ii would never change my appearance for vanity  but i mean the doctor said  that it could possibly improve my talent  which would help us all for nationals  possibly what about the risks  your voice is amazing as is rachel  hold up  could we all just get real here for a second  i hear that rachels got a bit of a schnoz  i mean i wouldnt know because like medusa i try  to avoid eye contact with her  but can we all just stop  lying about how there arent things  that we wouldnt change about ourselves  i mean im sure that sams been at the doctors office  and rifled through pamphlets on mouth reduction  ill bet arties thought about getting his legs removed  since hes not really using them anyways  and im definitely sure that tinas looked  into getting an eye deslanting  thats extraordinarily racist  im keepin it real  tina sorry santana im a beautiful person  im in love with myself and i would never change a thing  is that why youre wearing blue contacts today tina  selfhating asian  not many asian sex symbols mike  im just trying to be in fashion  and mirror what i see in the magazines  finn my dancing kind of bothers me  uh it almost killed rachel but i like the way i look  oh please  you have weird puffy pyramid nipples  they look like theyre filled with custard  or you could dust them  with powdered sugar and they could pass  for some sort of dessert  look maybe rachels fine with having an enormous beak  maybe she needs it to crack hard seeds all im saying  is that if you look in the mirror  and you dont like what you see you should change it  whoa guys  im really shocked at what im hearing here  it goes against everything the glee club stands for  im telling you the thing you would most like to change  about yourself is the most interesting part of you  well maybe but at this school  the thing that makes you different  is the thing people use to crush your spirit  school bell ringing  will rachels a beautiful girl  she doesnt need a nose job  saying that shes doing it to enrich her talent is just  a convenient excuse to deal with the fact  that shes insecure about how she looks  most of the adults we know have trouble embracing  their eccentricities so how can we expect kids to  well then it should be our job to help them  i dont want my legacy as a teacher  to be conjugated verbs and glee club trophies  i want to help them love themselves  for who they are warts and all  especially warts  how long do we have to do this for  until theyre all clean  i mean im really enjoying helping you with your ocd  do you know what i really dont like that term really  it sounds way too scientific and serious  i really prefer neat freak or cleanybug  but will i really have to tell you  im so appreciative of all your help  really i have so much more free time  now that there are four hands polishing all of my fruit  im really glad  but shouldnt we be figuring out  some techniques you can use  to eat your food without scrubbing it  you mean with germs and pesticides all over it  no i mean really deal with your issues on this stuff  will ive tried you know  and i i may not have been born this way  but this is my lot in life  theres nothing i can do about it  thank you  what for  i know how im going to get the kids  to accept what their differences are  by using their two favorite teachers  me and gaga  but im going to need your help  school bell ringing  santana i should be prom queen at this school  if i were prom queen  i could get brittany to drop the foureyed loser  and go for the real queen  shes so gullible i could convince her  that by royal decree id made her being with me  the law of the land  thats never going to happen  i dont have the votes  unless i could get the jock block   la sean connery jack ryan youve just boarded  the red october  sean connery  and god knows sam doesnt have  the heat at this school yet  hold on theres someone at this school  who just might have the juice  dave karofsky  holy crap  im a closet lesbian and a judgmental bitch  which means one thing i have awesome gaydar  school bell ringing  you

point out something theyre really bad at  but im getting better right  rachel mr schuester  may i have the floor please  its yours  so as all of you know ive had a few consultations  with a doctor who specializes in rhinoplasty  tina yes we know  thats all any of us have been talking about  and we think its a terrible idea  okay blue eyes youre such a hypocrite  i admit yes i dont like my eyes sometimes  the shape the color  but your selfhatred rachel has helped me see the light  i love myself  not enough clearly  when you get a nose job when you change your eyes  when you bleach your freckles  youre just announcing to the world  i dont like myself very much  the drams of this week  have made me realize  if i dont have many asian sex symbols to look up to  i have an obligation to maybe become one myself  my new mantra is  be the change you want to see in the world  i love you so much right now  rachel uh okay uh okay okay okay  besides tinas abrupt personal transformation  the compositions came back from the doctor  showing what my nose would look like slightly altered  and i have to say im really happy with the results  theyre less hebraic and more fabrayic  that doesnt really look like you  puck every year girls show up to my temple  after their 16th birthday  looking suddenly slightly different  and you know what  even though its easier to make out with them  without getting constantly stabbed in the eye  theyre not as hot  well this isnt about being hot  its about conquering your destiny  and finding something in yourself that you want to change  and change it  plus they said that it could improve my voice so  look if you guys arent willing to support my decision  then im pretty accustomed to making it on my own  rachel please dont do this  youre beautiful  this isnt a discussion  i have made up my mind  rachel berry is getting a nose job  school bell ringing  hey hey  hows the assignment going  well i actually wanted to talk to you about that  oh  the word you put on your tshirt  ginger  right  i was a little disappointed  you and i both know you should have put ocd on it  well i dont think its appropriate  to talk about such personal things with them  really those kids have to trust me  im supposed to be a role model  and youre not being one  were trying to teach these kids to to accept themselves  and you refuse to  will you know i wasnt born this way  it all started when i was five  and you never had any anxiety before that  i understand i was a very colicky baby  i mean i remember getting kicked out of preschool  because i was having panic attacks when they made us  use manila paper but  you have a severe anxiety disorder emma  all of us just humor it because you function so well  and youre so cute about it  but its really keeping you from enjoying your life  okay fine do you know what  if you want me to wear a shirt  that says batty or loon on it i will  totally fine  so what if i like my fruit free of contaminants  isnt that healthy  you know what i want  i want you to have lunch with me  is that unwashed fruit  yep here  have a blueberry  ugh  come on uhuh  no stop this isnt funny  im just trying to help you get better  i think accepting the fact that you have a problem  is the first step  okay what and you think torturing me  with unwashed fruits going to make me take that step  you know what i think emma  i think you are an expert at deflection  is that a new shirt  and i think you work so hard  at helping other people counseling them  so that you can avoid doing the hard painful work on yourself  school bell ringing  okay listen im all thats all im asking for  let me finish excuse me  quiet no  quiet okay we dont care what he has to say  shh now i know david has had some issues in the past  but i have great respect for what hes doing right now  and i ask you to hear him out  thank you how about we punch his face  right okay thats enough guys  figgins excuse me everyone listen up  first i just want to say how sorry i am  for what i did to kurt  and for what ive done to a lot of you  i think ive slushied every one of you  i treated kurt the worst  and im really ashamed  of who i am  and what i did  why should we believe you  you dont have to  i know ill need to earn your trust  all i can say is that santana has really helped me  to see the light  she showed me all these stories online about kids  jumping off of bridges and hanging themselves  because they were being bullied so bad  i couldnt believe  someone could make another person feel that awful  but she helped me accept  that i was one of those bad people  and i dont want to be anymore  wait santana  this glee club is not complete  not without kurt  so ive taken it upon myself to try to rehabilitate dave  to see if maybe kurt would  consider coming back and help us win nationals  i did this for us  and then something funny happened  something called love  tina im going to barf  karofsky i want kurt to feel safe  to come back which is why  santana and i have started a new club  the bully whips  the name was my idea  were going to be like guardian angels  figgins i have deputized david and santana  and the rest of their club to roam the halls  identifying bullying and stopping it in its tracks  im saying i want the pants okay  the ones you have on right now  then what will i wear for the rest of the day  thats a yp your problem not an mp my problem  hey z back off say what  what is this berets  everyone deserves a safe  school environment dont pick on this kid  its not cool and we wont allow it anymore  im planning on reaching out to kurt personally  through principal figgins  to try to make amends  this is a chance to really change this place  i hope you can support us  school bell ringing  you know you talk a great game but all im hearing is talk  and talk isnt going to keep kurt safe  but the antibullying club that david started will  the fact is  since the club began enforcing the nobullying rule  we havent had one incident  yeah and if i took all the water out of the ocean  it wouldnt be wet anymore  the bullying stopped because your top offender stopped  mr hummel can i call you burt  of course  you remember how understanding  i was about this when it all began  i didnt come to davids defense  i believed your son  thats because the david i was seeing was not  the young man i knew  the boy i raised was a cub scout  he was kind he was a good citizen  i still dont know what was going through  his mind when all this bullying stared  but i can tell you that the david im seeing now  is my son back again  this this is real  do you have any idea how much stress  this has caused my family  my son having to leave his friends  my wife and i spending money  we dont have on private school cause of your son  burt were you always so accepting of homosexuals  were the same age  i remember what we used to say  about the gays when we were younger  now its taken us  a long time to figure out whats right  why cant you just allow david the couple months  that its taken him to figure it out  because he said hes going to kill my son  i never actually meant that though  its just a figure of speech  hows he supposed to know what  your words still matter david  i know  you have to believe how awful i feel about them  those ones especially  thats not me not anymore  what do you think kurt  i believe he realizes what he did was wrong  youre only saying that because you want  to be back in this school so bad  can dave and i speak for a moment alone  you can wait right outside in the hall  lets go  yeah  crowd chatter  whats your angle here  im just trying to make things right  david i know remember  and i havent told anyone  why it would have made your life  a lot easier  i dont believe in denying who you are  but i dont believe in outing either  but still you owe me  the truth  whats going on here  sighs  it was santanas idea  she wants to be prom queen  so she figures if we can get you back  well get everyone to vote for us  im both repulsed and impressed by her lady macbethian ways  hmm a latina eve harrington  okay if youre going to be gay  you simply must know who that is  look i dont know for sure i am gay okay  stop being such a broken record  okay i have several options here  i could tell everyone the truth about you  dude i said im sorry you said you wouldnt do that  hold on  or i can return here and marvel with pride  at your new antibullying movement  which i fully believe in  and further demand that you and i start a chapter  of pflag here at william mckinley  parents family and friends of lesbians and gays  you need to be educated david  you may not have to come out but you need to be educated  oh man just kill me now  just keep an eye on your brother  one step ahead of you  school bell ringing  toilet flushing  you cant be in here noah  its cool i checked through the peep hole i drilled  last year to make sure no one was going  what can i help you with today  i just want to talk to you one hot jew to another  oh god look its my nose okay  i am tired of the lectures  hear me out why are you getting quinns nose  if you want to breathe better  why dont you have him give you karl maldens nose  your nose has been passed down  from generation to generation as a birthright  its a sign of the survival of our people  this has nothing to do with our religion  i need one hour of your time tomorrow just one hour  give me that and ill never bug you again  school bell ringing  what the hell is going on

in the making   why   everythings as if we never said   goodbye   ive spent so many mornings   just trying to resist you   im trembling now   you cant know how   ive missed you   missed the fairy tale adventure   in this everspinning   playground   we were young   together   im coming out of makeup   the lights already burning   not long until the cameras   will start turning   and the early morning madness   and the magic in the making   yes everythings as if we never said   goodbye   i dont want to be alone   thats all in the past   this worlds waited long enough   ive come home   at

if we never said   goodbye   yes everythings as if   we never said   goodbye   we taught the world   new ways to   dream   applause and cheering  school bell ringing  hey lucy  what did you just call me  well that certainly got your attention  can we speak privately  well you may want to have a seat  yeah  my dads college roommate was g gordon liddy  and he taught my pop a valuable lesson  he said the key to any campaign is digging up dirt  on your opponent so i did a little digging  puck dude my permanent record has three volumes  i dont remember doing half this stuff  jackpot  you moved to lima after eighth grade right  quinn i transferred from fairbrook thats not a secret  well you must have had a pretty lousy attendance record  because i called fairbrook middle school  and they didnt have  a record of anyone named fabray  which makes sense  as you actually lived  in an unincorporated part  of fairbrook township which would have meant  you would have gone to belleville middle school  not fairbrook  whispering so i took a little field trip  you didnt i did  and you know what they didnt have  a record of anyone named quinn fabray either  they did however have someone named lucy fabray  lucy q fabray  to be exact  and she looked like this  you can kind of see the resemblance  if you look past the nose job and subtract eh 70 pounds  stop okay  thats me  my middle name is quinn  i stopped going by lucy because kids made up a mean nickname  juicy lucy  lucy caboosey  i hated the way i looked  i had zits i was chubby  i felt terrible about myself  i didnt have friends  nobody would talk to me  i was the only kid at school who had to dissect their own frog  because nobody would be my lab partner  and then i joined ballet  lost a little bit of weight  found out i was athletic joined gymnastics  then cheerleading  went on proactiv for my acne  and when my dad got transferred  and got a raise i asked him if i could get a nose job  and he said yes  then i asked them to call me quinn  so you hate yourself  no i love myself  and thats why i did all those things  sniffles  ive been that girl and im never going back  i was a miserable little girl  and now im going to be prom queen  yeah see i wouldnt be so sure about that  you think everyones going to vote for you  because they want to be like you  well i dont know if theyre going to want to be like you  when they find out that youre a complete fraud  what are you going to do  if i were you id check the bulletin boards  alarms blaring  gasping sobbing  school bell ringing  why did you bring me here  is there a sale at claires  i brought you here to knock some sense into you  you wont listen to me you wont listen to finn  but you will listen to barbra streisand  thanks puck ill take it from here  nice effort  but only i can lead this barbravention  is she here no this is a mall in ohio  look rachel heres the deal  do you want to disappoint her  who barbra  of course not kurt shes my idol okay if you get  a nose job then you will be spitting  on her legacy barbra refused  to believe that beauty could only be defined  by the blonde chiseled faces of hitchcocks beauties  so she redefined what beauty was  and became the biggest female star in the world  but what if i cant be like her  isnt she one in a billion  so are you rachel  and if you let one misguided societal pressure  make you change the way
