out  what to get me  im freaking out i have no idea  what to get rachel for christmas  when in doubt go with socks   a wok is always good  what about soil  i agree with artie about the socks  you see  this is why i dont have a highmaintenance girlfriend  or any girlfriend for that matter  who told you kurt   no  yes   but i cant afford all this stuff  oh no silly no no  i just put 15 things on the list and you can pick out five  look in a in a few weeks im going to find out if im  a finalist for nyada or not and  well i just id really love to have a little yuletide bauble  as a goodluck charm for my audition  spray tan teeth whitening i mean  im just trying to make it easier for you  if youd like you can make a list for me also  well like the song says all i want for christmas is you  aw all i want for christmas is you too  and five things on that list  i love you  holy crap im dating kim kardashian  wheels porcelain other gay  the yuletide is upon us and everyone knows  that cistmas is a time for forgiveness  so i have decided to forgive you for having no talent  and ruining the american songbook  one mashup at a time  ive also forgiven you for forcing me  to run in and promptly lose  an humiliating statewide election  we accept your forgiveness  now christmas isnt just a time  when jewish kids get slightly uncomfortable  and dwarves get jobs as santas helpers  in demeaning nonunion commercials  that make them quietly die inside  no christmas is also a time to give back  which is why this friday i am volunteering  at the lima homeless shelter  and i thought maybe you and your fellow glee clubbers  might want to pitch in by giving the gift of song  coach sylvester ive heard you say on several occasions  that you dont believe in homelessness  you said you considered homeless people  urban campers  can i be honest with you  stumbles gelfling young burt reynolds  i lost my sister this past year  and this will be my first christmas without her  and honestly im just trying to keep myself occupie  i i made plans to shoot reindeer  from a helicopter with sarah palin but she canceled  apparently  todd gets fussy when she misses  his ballet recitals  wed be happy to help  oh thats fantastic  and now in the spirit of christmas  get the hell out of my office  we might have spent r entire decorating budget  for the whole year but with something that looks  as absolutely fabulous as this  i have to say bravhohoho  hey everybody listen up my man  rory flanagan here wants to say a few  thanks finn hudson  so guys my mummy was going to come visit  for the holidays but plane tickets are expensive  so its my first christmas without any family  id like to cheer myself up  by dedicating this song to them and to the king  jesus   ill have a blue   christmas   without you   ill be so blue   just thinking   about you   youll be doing all right   with your christmas of white   but ill   have a blue   blue blue blue christmas   ill have a blue   christmas  ooh ooh    thats certain   and when the blue   heartache stops hurting   ooh ooh    youll be doing all right   with your christmas of white   but ill   have a blue   blue   christmas   ooh    ooh  gosh that song was so depressing  i may actually be dead right now  ii think what santana means is although that  that was mournfully beautiful  now that the whole glee club is back together  i think that we should focus on the more joyous  and the pageant aspect of this holiday season  rachels right  last christmas was super sad  kurt was at another school  coach sylvester trashed everything and artie got a pair of magic legs  that broke the next day  we were the island of misfit toys  this year is going to be  this year its a whole new sprig of mistletoe  guess whos not getting coal  in their stockings foonce us  rory have a seat  just got off the phone with don borowski  the local station manager at limas pbs affiliate  turns out that their annual broadcast  of the yule log burning has been canceled  the hell yeah they cant afford the licensing fees anymore  but thank you scrooges who own that copyright  because don came to sectionals he loved what we did   and he is offering us  a christmas special featuring all of us  okay please say you said yes  not only did i say yes but when don said  that they were looking for a director for the special  i nominated you artie   me  yeah  he saw west side story loved your work  and he wants to take a meeting  but i  i swore i would never sell out and do television  im really going to have to think about this mr shue  ill have to show you my locker stacking secrets  so that never happens again  is that your family  the whole flanagan clan its hard isnt it  being away from them  its so hard  its harder than i ever imagined  i know the feeling  im only a few hours away from my family  and i miss them like crazy  what are you going to do for christmas this year  im even not sure brittany and her family  are going on a trip to see a gay santa  something about santa fe  why dont you spend the holiday with uh my family  ii need help staying awake on the drive plus this whole week  ill be your christmas sponsor  really show you what the holiday spirits about in the usa  thatd be so awesome sam  i am absolutely delighted  that our channels christmas special  is being directed by a teenage disabled boy  youre like a modern day tiny tim  oh i am sorry  tiny tim could walk  in the spirit of christmas im going  to pretend you never said that  heres the dealio mr borowski  i have two ironclad demands  the first one came to me last night in a dream  the wookiee was right  the best christmas show of all time is  the star wars holiday special shown only once  in 1978 then locked away in the lucasfilm vault  like the precious jewel it is  every fanboy in the galaxy knows  its completely awesome  therefore star wars must be a part of our christmas special  and i also want to shoot it in black and white  black and white  it will be an homage to the second best special of all time  the judy garland christmas show  you know some s judy was high on pills and booze but  i say she was high on excitement and baby jesus  kid you can shoot the thing in 3d  starring a flock of pigeons  as long as you can produce it for under 800 bucks  i can do it sir i know i can   its coming on christmas   theyre cutting down trees   theyre putting up reindeer   and singing songs of joy and peace    oh i wish i had a river   i could skate away on   i wish i had a river so long   i would teach my feet   to fly   oh i wish i had a river   i could skate away on   i made my baby cry   he tried hard to help me   you know he t me at ease   he loved me so naughty   made me weak in the knees   oh i wish i had a river   i could skate away on  yeah  rachel could you come see me  yes artie of course  and if this is about my ears  i know that theyre a little naked right now  but thats just because im waiting for something special  something thats really gonna sparkle and you know  catch the light so whats up  its not about your ears its about your song  it makes me want to kill myself  im sorry joni mitchell is not depressing shes emotional  it doesnt fit my vision for our christmas spectacular  and what is that exactly  we begin in the swiss alps in the village of gstaad  in the perfelyappointed living room of kurt hummel  and blaine andersons chic swank chalet  the tree towering and opulent  the fireplace draped in garlands  the stockings bejeweled  kurt and blaine  the perfect hosts have invited their friends to drop in  for an evening of noel cowardesque banter  and fun happy cheerfilled songs  are you telling me im not invited to kurt and blaines for christmas  not unless you pick a happier song  the evenins festivities conclude with rory  dressed as the christmas elf itchy  reciting frosty the snowman  start with fun end with fun  thats how you do it kids  the frosty story isnt fun  at the end he melts and dies  im rebooting frosty  in my version he doesnt melt  he  well new pages forthcoming  whats wrong with a story thats a little sad  or a song thats a little depressing  i mean thats part of christmas too right  its the sad things  that make you remember whats really important  sorry sam but the phrase is merry christmas not morose christmas  thats the vision  thats what you have to buy into  well sorry artie im not buying into it  im gonna go downtown see if i can ring one of those salvation army bells come on rory  ill give you a ride  i should memorize my part sam  hey  bummer about artie going all scrooge on your song  im getting a song in that christmas special  christmas is all about giving and artie certainly wouldnt be  in the christmas spirit if he didnt let me give my talents  to the people of western ohio  at least the ones who dont have cable  speaking of giving dont you think it would be a shame  for me to sing on television for the first time without me  sparkling in the glow of one of your generous gifts  oh you want me to give you your present early  i hadnt even thought about that but what a sweet idea  yeah okay yeah  all right  okay usually it comes in a box but  okay  wheres my bling  well that was a little out of mymy price range  butbut then i saw this commercial for these african sow pigs you can adopt  you pay like two bucks a month to fatten them up for  a whole year and then they feed a family for like a month  you gave me a dead pig for christmas  no no its not dead yet you got to get it fat first   im a vegan  look i thought  christmas was about giving okay  which is why i gave you a super specific list  look its very sweet that you gave me a pig  its an african sow pig  whatever it is i i appreciate it  but i made you a list so that you wouldnt  embarrass yourself like this  im not asking for much  all i want is whats coming to me  all i want is my fair share  guess ill give the sow pig to my mom or something  that is such a great idea  its gonna be the best chrtmas ever   he came into my dreams last night    a great big man in red and white    he told me that its gonna be    a special year for you and me

lighthearted heartwarming upbeat happy christmas tale  frosty the snowman  actually i was going to read that but  i searched my heart  and im going to read one from a different book  i think its something thats going to remind people  what the true spirit of christmas really is  are you sure you dont want to read frosty  we all really want to hear frosty  lights please  and there were in the same country  shepherds abiding in the field  keeping watch over their flock by night  and lo the angel of the lord came upon them  and the glory of the lord shone around them  and the angel said unto them fear not  for behold  i bring ye good tidings  of great joy which shall be to all people  for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior  which is christ the lord  and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude  of the heavenly host praising god and saying  glory to god in the highest  and on earth peace  goodwill toward men  what  everyones just been telling me youve been having a rough year but you seem pretty od to me  im better  think i was just stuck focusing on everything i didnt have  and none of the stuff that was good  stuff in the future  im glad you turned it around  you deserve good things quinn  im trying  ah ah ah ah  portion control bee sting  come on  guess youre just not used to being on this side  of the serving line  seriously though i dont think we have enough food for everybody  yeah  economy gets bad people give less  hey  i know were late but we were all hoping theres still time to help  we brought the turkey from the special with all the fixings  yeah its a prop but its real  why dont you put it on the table over there kiddo  you guys finally me around  well you can thank rory for helping us see the light  i was just following my christmas sponsors lead  would it be weird if i made myself a plate  we have a song too we were gonna perform it  as our final number for our christmas special  but we lost the final ten minutes of airtime  when the station reached a lastsecond agreement  with those yule log people  as long as its not jingle bells  it seems its the only song our janitor knows how to play and im bleeding from the ears  if youd be so kind   sure  love your jingle bells though   its christmastime   theres no need to be afraid   at christmastime   we let in light and we banish shade    and in our world of plenty   we can spread a smile of joy  hrow your arms around the world at christmastime    but say a prayer   pray for the other one   oh at christmastime its hard    but when youre having fun   theres a world outside your window    and its a world of dread and fear    where the only water flowing   is the bitter sting of tears   and the christmas bells that ring    are the clanging chimes of doom    well tonight thank god its them    instead of you   and there wt be snow in africa this christmastime   this christmastime no    the greatest gift theyll get this year is life    is life   where nothing ever grows   nothing ever grows   no rain or rivers flow   do they know its christmastime at all    yeah   feed the world   let them know its christmastime    feed the world   let them know its christmastime    feed the world   let them know its christmastime    feed the world   let them know its christmastime again   just the guy i was looking for  hi  i wanted you to know that i named my pig  the african sow pig  yep come here  her name is barbra  after my hero  i mean im assuming that shes a girl  but i just hope that pig barbra inspires all of the children  who eat her as much as the real barbra inspired me  so its a kosher sow pig  yeah  look the important thing is is that i just want you to know that im really sorry  okay ii love her and i love you and thats all that matters to me on christmas  okay  well iim glad you like the pig  barbra  barbra but uh then i realized  that once they kill and eat barbra  youre not gonna have anything to show for this years christmas  so i got you something else  you ready  yes  its your own star  you named a star after me  well no i uh i thought about that  but then i named it finn hudson  because theres already a star named rachel berry  and shes right here on earth and shes brighter than any of those stars up there  so i just wanted to make sure that whenever she feels lonely  she can look up in theky and no matter where i am  she can know that im looking down on her  when its nighttime  i love this  im gonna put it up right over here  and uh just in case itsits cloudy  or uh the middle of the daytime or the star explodes  in some massive supernova  these should shine just as bright   its too much  no no its okay  ii hawked my letterman jacket on ebay so  no no  its too much wonderful for one girl  i mean i get thethe guy and the stars and  the pig  i think its time that i start giving back  come on  lets go get our coats  these bells make me homesick  you mean like church bells and stuff  no  my brother shamus gets lost all the time  so my dad made him wear a bell around his neck  so we could always find him  smart  merry christmas  sam i was wondering if maybe  youd like to be my valentines day sponsor as well  i mean you did such a good job being a christmas sponsor  i figured youd have no problem  helping me land a snog or two by february  deal but you have to help me  learn to perfect my sean connery  im telling you impressions are the best way  to get a chick  whoa  so hows business guys  uh a little slow  but the revival house across the street  is showing its a wonderful life  so pretty sure well clean up when it gets out  well just in case we wanted to make  our own little contribution to the cause  sure you want to do this rachel  yes i already got my christmas present  all right guys  whoa did you guys knock off a liquor store or something  no we just finally realized what really matters  yeah we returned the earrings that finn got me for christmas  and the ipod that i bought
