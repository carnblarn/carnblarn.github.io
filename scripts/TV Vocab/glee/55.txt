                1 admit it wonder twins the only reason why  the new directions beat the trouble tones at sectionals  is because that pervy clown judge was freakin high as a kite  and we did michael

days to the minute since i proposed to you  which is the amount of time you said you needed  before youd give me an answer  look this isnt the kind of decision  you can make on a deadline  look i understand you said you needed  some time but not hearing a decisions  kind of bumming me out  no look  i love you okay  and i want to marry you someday  and i really im open to anything  this is all just happening so fast  and i dont understand it  i mean i i need you to help me understand  okay well  even if you dont get into nyada  youre still gonna go to new york   yes and i want you to come with me  and i will  but were crazy if we think that its gonna be easier  to be a couple there than it is here  my point is that  those rings areare  will always be a reminder  of exactly how we feel right now  theyre gonna let us world into the big city  look thats really romantic  but i have to be honest really crazy to me okay  i dont need to marry you youre the only guy for me  okay i guess my answer for now is  no no dont dont say anything  youre right we shouldnt decision on a deadline  just uh  take a couple more days okay  okay favorite michael jackson memory go  when i was one my mom of his motown special  and when he did the moonwalk across the stage  for the first time in history i uttered my first words   hot damn  i owe the king of pop a deep debt of gratitude  he was the first one to pull off the sequined military jacket  long before one kurt hummel made it iconic  i have to be honest i never really got him  and we are no longer on speaking terms  no i think hes an amazing performer but ive  never really just got what he was about  rachel he was best friends with liza minnelli and liz taylor  no all im saying is that ii just i havent connected  with him the way that i have with the likes of barbra  or either of the stephens  sondheim schwartz  id throw this mocha in your face  but its not nearly scalding enough  okay but just since you guys are so jazzed about him  i think its a good idea  well that might not be the best idea  hey blaine hello everyone else  does he live here or something seriously you are always here  why dont you think thats a good idea  because were doing mj for regionals  you see warblers drew first position  so as soon as i heard what  your plan was list accordingly  im sorry how how did you hear  uh blaine told me this morning  i just called for a tip on how to get  red wine out of my blazer piping and he  would not stop going on about it  i may have mentioned it   how often do you talk  oh my god hey kurt  i didnt recognize you  you are wearing boy clothes for once  all right twink i think its time that i show you  a little lima heights hospitality  unless you want to join your relatives in prison  thats probably not the best idea  you see my dad is call a states attorney  but if you had a piata you wanted delivered  i bet he could make sure that got to them  all right so heres what you guys should know  i am captain of the warblers now  and im tired of playing nice  there has to be some kind  of show choir competition committee we can complain to  i know it sucks the end of the world  heck you had your set of the competitiony  at sectionals and you pulled that one off right  well they can have our journey and our dreamgirls  but pilfering my michael mmmm thats another level not okay  im not exactly comfortable with blaine in the room  clearly once a warbler always a warbler   uh whwhat  dude you told them what we were gonna do  youre like a modernday eggs benedict hes on notice  as far as im concerned  we should all be on notice i mean  next to vocal adrenaline the warblers  are the best glee club in the state  and for a lot of us this is our last shot at a championship  so we should stop complaining  about the warblers and figure out how to beat them  i couldnt have said it better myself finn  im less worried about our set list right now  and more interested in getting us in the right mindset  to crush those guys  which is why our lesson for the week is  what would michael jackson do  hed fight back  hed say regionals is ours mj is ours  and if they want it they can pry it  from our sequingloved hand  mmhmm straight up  in 1983 mtv said they wouldnt air his billie jean video  whatd he do he fought back  they aired it and the thriller album  sold an additional ten million copies   thats right  i know what michael would do  i think he would take it to the streets  intro to billie jean plays  well were here  we got something to settle  both of us want to use mj  but only one can  were having  a jacksonoff nick at nite  winner gets the king of pop for regionals  what us against the two of you  you really think youre that bad  is that what they teach you  at that little public school of yours  its time to see whos bad  billie jean fades into intro to bad  ba ba ba ba   dow dow dow dowdow   dow dow dow dowdow   dow dow dow dowdow   dow dow dow   your butt

dow dow dowdow   dow dow dow dowdow   your lyin eyes   gonna take you right   so listen up   dont make a fight   your talk is cheap   youre not a man   youre throwing stones   to hide your hands   well they say the skys the limit   and to me thats really true   but my friends you have seen nothing   just wait till i get through because im bad    bad bad   im bad    really really bad   come on    you know im bad im bad   bad bad    really really bad   you know it    you know im bad   bad bad    really really bad   come on you know   and the whole world has to answer right now   just to tell

bad im bad   bad bad    you know it   really really bad   and the whole world has to answer right now   just to tell you once again whos bad   oh my god  how is he is he okay  uh its his right eye  uh the doctor says that his cornea is deeply scratched  and he has to have surgery  in all my years as a teacher and a student  i have never known a slushee  to do that kind of damage  thats cause it wasnt a normal slushee mr shue  there was stuff in it rocks or something  he wanted to do that damage  well unless you have proof that he tampered with the slushee  the police arent interested in getting involved  sebastian is evil  he needs to be expelled  look figgins and i spoke to daltons headmaster  theyre opening up an investigation  so guys im telling you  please let the system handle this one  no daltons oldschool mr shue theyre not gonna turn their backs  on one of their own we need payback  an eye for an eye  no i have a zerotolerance policy for violence of any kind  thats not how we do things  no we sing and thats all we ever do  do you want to get disqualified from regionals  i dont give a damn about regionals  what do you expect from us were people  i know the rest of the world  may not see us like that but when they tease us  and throw stuff at us  and toss us in dumpsters  and tell us that were nothing but losers  with stupid dreams it freaking hurts  and were supposed to turn the other cheek  and be the bigger man by telling ourselves  that those dreams and how hard we work  make us better than them  but it gets pretty damn hard to feel  that way when they always get to win  i get how upsetting this is for you  no you dont  and dont give me any of that it gets better crap  because im not interested in it getting any better  i want it to be better like right now  i want to hurt them the way they hurt us  no worse  i want them to feel my pain  because frankly thats all i have left to give  artie take a break  well be here when you get back  scream

ever dreamed of  youre going to have to break up with him   thats an awful thing to say  look  you wanted straight and thoughtful  i guess at one point  it made sense to love somebody for your whole life  but it doesnt anymore  women are finding themselves in their 30s now  every magazine says it we hardly know  what were going to want in 15 years  i mean finn and i we can grow together  look rachel you and finn are a lovely couple  but if you really want to be happy  youre going to have to say goodbye  never can say goodbye playing  ooh ooh ooh ooh  never can say goodbye    say goodbye  no no no no now    never can say goodbye   say goodbye   even though the pain and heartache   seems to follow me wherever i go   though i try and try to hide my feelings   they always seem to show

people but i refuse  to take it from sebastian the criminal chipmunk  so ive been sitting here for the last hour  making a list of ways to get back at him  well today is your lucky day because auntie

that i am fully prepared  to go all danny la russo on your ass  admit you put something in that slushee  what was it huh  glass asphalt  red dye number six  youre a liar  she questioned my honor  i demand satisfaction  in warbler tradition  you want to have a duel  cello guys can you hang back for a second im gonna  need you for this one  everyone else clear out  i dont want you to see me  make a girl cry  lets just keep this on point  smooth criminal begins  as he came in through the window it was the sound   of a crescendo   he came into her apartment   he left bloodstains on the carpet   she ran underneath the table   he could see she was unable   so she ran into the bedroom   she was struck down it was her doom   annie are you okay   so annie are you okay   are you okay annie   annie are you okay    so annie are you okay   are you okay annie   annie are you okay    so annie are you okay   are you okay annie    annie are you okay   so annie are you okay   are you okay annie   annie are you okay would you tell us   that youre okay   theres a sign in the window that he struck you   a crescendo annie   he came into your apartment   he left the bloodstains on the carpet   and then you ran into the bedroom you were struck down   it was your doom    annie are you okay   so annie are you okay   are you okay annie   annie are you okay   so annie are you okay   are you okay annie   annie are you okay   are you okay annie   youve been hit by   youve been struck by   a smooth criminal   i dont know   annie are you okay   would you tell us that youre okay    theres a sign in the window   i dont know   that he struck you a crescendo annie    he came into your apartment   i dont know    left the bloodstains on the carpet   i dont know why baby   then you ran into the bedroom you were struck down it was your doom annie    dad gone it baby   annie are you okay    would you tell us that youre okay   dad gone it baby    theres a sign in the window   dad gone it baby    that he struck you a crescendo annie   hoo hoo   he came into your apartment   left the blood stains on the carpet    then you ran into the bedroom you were struck down   hoo hoo   it was your doom annie youve been hit by   youve been struck by   a smooth criminal   i was better  you werent even close  i was better  now tell me the truth  what did you put in that slushee  rock salt but its okay  why is it okay  i just told you that blaine had to have surgery  its okay because i didnt put anything in this one  before mr shue gets here come on  brittany lock the door  i dont know how to do that  um whats going on  weve got the warblers right where we want them  and because hes the smoothest criminal i know  artie was able to find a spy store  that sells topsecret surveillance equipment  not topsecret  i just got a tape recorder from officemax  okay okay whatever  in any case i taped it to my underboob  when we went to dalton and i got  sebastian on tape admitting that there was rocksalt  in that slushee that blinded blaine  now all we have to do is send this tape to the popo  and that little bitchlet is headed to juvie  admit it tell me the truth  what did you put in that slushee  rock salt  no no were not doing that  why kurt this isnt violent this is clever  i taped it to my underboob  so he gets kicked out of school  the warblers still do michael and they still beat us  look i want to see sebastians head turning on a spit  but ive realized that you cant go looking for payback  every time the world wrongs you  if michael went after all the haters  he would have never had any time  to do all that amazing music  so were not gonna punish the warblers  were gonna teach them a lesson  and i think i know how  ive reserved the auditorium so if you all just follow me  oh wait  if kurt would have taped this  to his junk i would have never heard the end of it  we would have had a whole week of songs  about it  rachel can i borrow you for a second  yeah  so are we gonna practice or something  look i know that youre waiting for an answer  andand trust me you deserve it  no no i get it its a big decision  its just the way i asked you i kind of left out  the most important part  about how much rent we would save if we went twosies  just listen okay  i always feel like you hear me better when im not talking  i just cant stop loving you begins  each time the

supportive of each other  this is what we call taking the high road  which i was shocked to find out has nothing to do  with marijuana  just because youre doing  michael doesnt mean you understand
