                1  so heres what you missed on glee  proms coming up and quinns desperate to win queen  so she can hold on to finn  who still sort of has eyes for rachel  but zizes also wants to be queen and pucks up for king  and karofsky and santana want to win too  cause they both got a secret theyd like to keep  have you ever heard of the term beards  artie and brittany were bf and gf  but he got mad and said she was stupid  and now theyre not bf and gf  you were the only person at this school  that never called me that  can you believe that  and thats what you missed on glee  hi everyone its junior prom minus six days  here at mckinley and today im joined  by junior prom king candidate noah puckerman  i prefer puck so noah can i get a comment  on the recent poll number that put the fabrayhudson ticket  ten points above you and zizes  aka the road warriors  were still ahead of santana and karofsky  by half a point so our campaign strategy  is to close the gap using a combination  of intimidation and fear  awesome and classy  one more question this one was emailed in by a fan  where does lauren keep your balls  what  im sure youve heard the word on the street  that youve been neutered by ms zizes  that shes the one who wears the pants in the relationship  shut up or ill beat your ass  im not scared ive been hit by a girl before  this is jbi signing off  tune in tomorrow when well be interviewing  frontrunner quinn fabray  hubba hubba  i have some bad news  will schuester is leaving mckinley  to go to broadway  oh william im devasted  positively horny with grief  as a goingaway present heres a spray bottle  of i cant believe its not butter  to keep that headmerken looking buttery fresh  no no junior prom is in one week  and my favorite band cancelled  what band air supply william  so im inviting my next favorite group  the new directions  nope no way um  i agree i mean normally we would jump  at the chance to perform but  i mean weve got nationals in three weeks  which means that we have a lot of rehearsals  and a lot of taffy to sell just so we can afford the trip  william this glass is halffull of dreams for all of us  i have decided to give all the money  to the glee club that i was going to pay air supply  so thats 400 right there for you  i wont allow it im prom coordinator and i was not consulted  each year i honor the prom with a bowl of my familys secret punch recipe  made all the more meaningful to me because its  the punch bowl my grandmother drowned in  and each year that punch bowl is spiked  such lawlessness will only be encouraged  when being screeched at by that glee club  sue it is not a discussion  we are in the lurch  fine well then let me take this opportunity  to make a request  william i have in my spanks at all times  a list of the worst songs  ever performed by the glee club  and i would appreciate it if you would not reprise  any of the following numbers  number one  run joey run  you should literally apologize to america  for that one number two  the ingenius mashup  of crazy in love and hair  now i know you must have been  pretty tired when you put that baby together  if youll excuse me  well see you at the prom butt chin  ive been to ann taylor loft  filenes basement and like six forever 21s  and i cannot find a dress that fits  im gonna be forced to make my own dress for prom  dont youll seem poor youre up for queen  you cant make your own prom dress  prom is like our oscars  its seriously like  the most important night of our lives  what about getting married  oh you can get married as many times as you want  you only have one shot at your junior prom  what are you guys talking about prom dresses  thank god i dont have to worry about that im not going  why not cause nobodys asked me  all right guys prom  please tell me were not  doing songs about prom  nope we are the prom  figgins has asked us to perform  lets do run joey run  now i know this isnt ideal with  nationals coming up but we really dont  have a choice  and we could really use the money  but i know that prom is a special rite of passage  im gonna make sure that all of you guys  get a chance to enjoy the dance too  so were gonna stagger  the performances  so that each and every one of you  has a lot of time to dance with your dates  excuse me  is she okay mercedes doesnt have a date for prom  so i dont have a date  im just going to dance and then all your dates are  gonna ignore you and come dance with me so  your dates are really my dates  im gonna go talk  to mercedes no let me  hey  you know i dont have a date to prom either  you know i know that i talk a good game  about not needing a man and i dont  i just really wanted to take a date to the prom  i want the dress  and the guy  and the damn corsage  somebody somebody still may ask you  its this saturday you know  i just wanted to be cinderella  just for one night  one night where a guy would  would look at me under those corny crepe paper streamers  and say you look so beautiful  and then hed  grab my hand and ask me to dance  isnt that what prom is supposed to be about  youre not gonna go to prom alone  youll go with me thats even more depressing  i have a plan  give me your hand  blaine warbler  will you go to junior prom with me  prom  itll be the social event of the season  you dont want to go to prom with me no no  of course of course i want to go with you  its just  prom  what about prom blaine  at my old school there was a sadie hawkins dance  and i had just come out  so i asked a friend of mine  the only other gay guy in the school  and while we were waiting for his dad to pick us up  these three guys  um  beat the living crap out of us  i  im so sorry  imim out and im proud  and all that this is just  a little bit of a sore spot  this is perfect  you couldnt face up to the bullies at your school  so you can do it at mine  we could do it together  but i have to say blaine  that if it makes you feel uncomfortable at all  then well just forget about prom  well go to a movie instead  i am crazy about you  so ill take that as a yes  yes  yes you and i are going to the prom  mm mm  is this a surprise party or something  because my birthday was last week  itit was  um no  mercedes and i we have a proposition for you  we were wondering if youd like to go  to prom with us kind of like a  a threeway date but not the dirty kind  that sounds great but i cant afford to take  one girl to the prom i dont know how im gonna take two  whats this our prom budget  youre gonna have to borrow a suit from your dad  and were gonna buy fivedollar dresses  down at the goodwill and make our own corsages  out of flowers from my moms garden  and we can walk to prom and then use whats left  to get the 899 allyoucaneat  pasta special at breadstix  but you know the 20 its not charity its a loan  so youll go with us  it would be an honor  yes  ladies i appreciate you welcoming me  into the sacred inner sanctum that is the prom gown dry run  why did we decide to include kurt  because getting a look past him is like  getting a thumbs up from joan and melissa rivers  it just might goose our preprom buzz factor  i look like  a lemon meringue pie  i think you look delicious  dont despair  nobody bigger than a size two  looks good in a prom dress i mean theyre practically  designed to make us look awkward  i think  the color is wrong  lets go navy hm  its chic and slimming  duly noted  agree agree oh my god  its brilliant  absolutely next  i knew it fashion  devil in a red dress  perfect and its totally appropriate for your personality  i have no criticisms  go with god satan santana  now if you ladiesll excuse me  i have to pull options for my own prom outfit  wait so youre going stag  thats just tragic  yes im going and not alone  with blaine  congratulations thats amazing  ladies if youll excuse me  i have a private fashion question for kurt okay  so kurt  i think that you need a full security detail which the bully whips  and i would be more than happy to provide you with  you know like the hells angels when the rolling stones  the rolling stones performed at altamont speedway  i think that went off without a hitch  and why would you do that  because ill get sympathy votes for prom queen  ill be like the lawandorder eva peron candidate  grimace and stretch marks  wont stand a chance  so since you dont have a date  to the prom now i was hoping you could  help me out with operation punch and judy  every year at mckinley  they crown a king and queen at the prom  but theres a shadow world a dark community  of trouble makers that crown the prom antiking  and youre planning on that being you  my street creds in the gutter  if i actually win prom king with lauren ill never be able  to rebuild my reputation  as a lovable but dangerous miscreant  i have to spike coach sylvesters punch  what does this have to do with me  im prime suspect number one  coach sylvester wont let me within ten feet of that bowl  when she grabs me  ill create a diversion with my sweet dance moves  shell be mesmerized hypnotized by my love dance  thats when youll sneak in behind us  and pour a bottle of gin in the bowl  awesome right  so are you in  as my assistant badass look  im im sorry  while i admire  your badboy villainy and yes long for the day  when i am similarly cool  i just i dont think spiking the prom hooch  will impress brittany enough  theres got to be a surefire way  for her to both forgive me and accept my prom proposal  theres got to be  oh members of the audiovisual club i may possibly  sing this song at prom  and when im done rehearsing id like your feedback  tell me if i was brilliant or simply outstanding  theres a fire   starting in my heart   reaching a fever pitch   and its bringing me out the dark   finally   i can see you crystal clear   go ahead and sell me out and ill lay your ship bare   ooh  see how   i leave with every piece of you   dont underestimate   the things that i will do   theres a fire   starting in my heart   reaching a fever pitch   and its bringing me out the dark   the scars of your love remind me of us   they keep me thinking that we almost had it all   the scars of your love   they leave me breathless   i cant help feeling   we could have had it all   youre gonna wish you   never had met me   rolling in the deep  tears are gonna fall   rolling in the deep  you had my heart   inside of your hand  youre gonna wish you never had met me   and you played it  tears are gonna fall   to the beat  rolling in the deep   throw your soul   through every open door   count your blessings to find what you look for   turn my sorrow   into treasured gold   pay me back in kind and reap just what youve sown   youre gonna wish you   yeah we could have had it all  never had met me   tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep   we could have had it all  youre gonna wish you   never had met me  it all it all   it all  tears are gonna fall   hey  rolling in the deep   you could have had it all  youre gonna wish you never had met me   rolling in the deep  tears are gonna fall   rolling in the deep  you had my heart   inside of your hand  youre gonna wish you never had met me   and you played and you played and you played   and you played it   to the beat   its good to see you again rachel  jessie what are you doing here  i mean how was i supposed to know  that i was actually supposed to show up  to those other classes at school  i was majoring in show choir  i just assumed it would be like at carmel  and the school would get some asian kid  to take math and english and scientific for me  thats awful  i came back to see you rachel  what i did to you thats my one great regret  yeah it was kind of weird  one day you were telling me that you loved me  and then you were inexplicably throwing eggs  at my head the next  i know i know  i traded love  for a fourth consecutive national championship  it was a bum deal  for a first maybe but for a fourth no way  ive come to make amends  so what are you doing for prom  so i heard a nasty rumor that jessie st james is back in town  and i also heard that he is going to be your date  no hes joining  mercedes and sam and i on our prom on a budget  hes going to be in town for a while though  so im not sure whats going to come of it  i just i dont trust him  dont you remember what he did to you how awful he was  you cant tell me what to do anymore okay  if i want to date jessie or anyone for that matter  it stopped being your business when you broke up with me  ii still care about you  look all i ask is that whoever i choose  that you be as supportive of me  as i have been of you and quinn even though  im dying every day inside about it  you know i dont even want to go to the stupid prom anymore  quinn has got me handing out  pens with our names on them  wheres the dignity  and i hate renting those tuxes and the corsage  i know im going to pick the wrong one  and then quinns going to be all pissed off  and her moms going to look at me like hey just  just get her something simple  a wrist corsage  girls like quinn you dont want to do anything  thats going to distract from their face  so ask for a gardenia  with a with a light green ribbon  wrapped around it to match her eyes  okay  everything looks good  no gay protests or rainbow flags being lit on fire down this way  are you finished talking  yeah  when youre finished talking you should say over  sorry  no burning liberace mannequins  over  all right lady lips all clear  teen gay you may now proceed to the next checkpoint  without fear of violence  why are you speaking so loud  im the lawandorder prom queen candidate  here to protect every student at this school  from harassment  did she  im im walking away from you now  just crack the egg  i just dont understand the difference between an egg  with a baby chicken inside of it and an egg with an egg in it  theyre the same thing  okay thats really confusing  because this is a baby chickens house  mrs hagberg i understand that cupcakes  are really trendy right now  and i know the making of a foie gras  might be a little morose  but um i would like to at least graduate high school  knowing how to make some kind of pt  excuse me mrs hagberg i need to say something  brittany i was a jerk  to you  mmhmm and i want to make it up to you with a song  so maybe youll consider going to prom with me  a prom proposal  isnt she lovely   isnt she wonderful   i never thought through love wed be   making one as lovely as she   but isnt she lovely   made from love   i thought this song was about a baby  isnt she pretty   oh my god  truly the angels best   boy im so happy   we have been heaven blessed   i cant believe what god has done   through us hes given life to one   but isnt she lovely   made from love   isnt she lovely   life and love are the same   londie it could have not been done   without you who conceived the one   thats so very lovely   made from love   ow   whoo  so  artie that was lovely  but im not going to go to prom with you  you called me stupid and i really didnt like that  so im sorry but im gonna go to prom by myself  and really work on me  and dance with other peoples dates  i understand  i i hope you know how sorry i am  yeah  dude  sorry for the timing but id really like to revisit  the possibility of you helping me spike the punch bowl  im in  i have nothing to live for  so you think its cool if i jam with you guys at prom  yeah totally  good news boys  my buddy enzo from the tux rental shop  is giving you half off  sweet  yeah so what are you going to go with  im going simple  black  thin lapel collar very discreet  know what i wore to my prom  i wore a powder blue tux with a ruffled shirt  and a big velour bowtie  looked like tony orlando  was that a designer  no  no need for half off my outfit  because half of it is already off  my ensemble is an homage to the recent royal wedding  and the late alexander mcqueen  i had to make it myself  theres simply nothing off the rack that is suitable  for the young fashionable man in ohio  dude that rocks its like gay braveheart  i dont like it  well of course you dont like it  its not finished yet  i think it still needs like a sash or maybe some beads  look im not going to stop you  from wearing it but i got to be honest i  i think youre just trying to stir  the pot a little bit  i think youre trying to get some attention  exactly  whats the point of dressing up  i mean thats why some guys wear  the tails with the top hat  and and the girls wear the hoop skirts  i mean blaine help me out here  i think your dad has a point  ii think what hes trying to say  is that we just dont want  to give anyone a reason to cause any trouble  theres a lot of bad people out there kurt  and theyre a lot worse  than this karofsky kid  and all theyre looking for is a match  to light under the fire  of their hate  now of course i  i want i want you to be yourself  but i also i want you to be practical  i have done everything right  now blaine i understand  that after what youve been through youre worried  but prom is about joy not about fear  so i am wearing this suit  i worked hard on it  and i think its fantastic  and if you dont want to join me i completely understand  here we are third period french class  im going to calculus so wait inside the classroom  after the bell rings  until i get back to walk you to lunch  have you noticed that no one has said boo to me this week  thats cause the bullywhips are protecting you  maybe  but maybe no one has been harassing me this week  because nobody cares  youre dreaming okay look  im not saying that everyone in this school  is ready to embrace the gay  but maybe at least  theyve evolved enough to be indifferent  i see how miserable you are dave  i could just hate you when you were bullying me  but now all i see is your pain  and you dont have to torture yourself over this  im not saying you should come out tomorrow  but maybe soon the moment will arise when you can  whats wrong  im so im so freaking sorry kurt  im just  so sorry for what i did to you  i know  i know  cool  thanks  remember you wait for me here right  quinny your dates here  thats one of the good things about being in glee club  you really get to know your way around a cummerbund  let me get my camera  you look great  youre the most beautiful girl  ive ever seen in my life  i uh i got you a wrist corsage  the ribbon matches my eyes i know  okay you two picture time  you look like cinderella  lets get together ah  okay  give me prom pose  mercedes can i just say that you look fierce  in your dress totally mercedes  you both look smokin  youre damn straight we do  seriously though jessie what do you think of the bolo tie  pretty cool right  saw springsteen  in the cover of tunnel of love album wearing it  dude that was like 20 years ago  im really sorry to hear  about what happened with your family sam  um i hope its okay i sort of  filled jessie in on what was going on  of course its okay  sam has nothing to be ashamed of  i know how tough it is out there  i couldnt even get a job  as one of those singing waiters at johnny rockets  but ive got an idea  they say that the best time  to start any business is during a recession  i dont know why or even what a recession is  but its my understanding that were in one  hes so smart i cant believe he flunked out of college  so i was thinking  what are the two things that im great at  show choir and destroying the competition  so what if i opened up a dance studio  where i could act as a consultant  for show choirs looking to get that extra edge  do you think there are enough show choirs  to keep you in business  of course there are thatthats a brilliant idea  you could you could be like thethe show choir whisperer  im sure we could get mr shue to hire him in a second and  thats how we can beat vocal adrenaline  hey guys you look amazing  and dont forget to vote for hudsonfabray tonight  hey jessie whatd you order scrambled eggs  i mean i know you usually  like them served on peoples heads  quinn you look stunning  the ghost of grace kelly  let me know if you get tired  of your boyfriend stomping on your  pretty little feet all night  ill
