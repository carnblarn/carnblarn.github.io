                1 brittany out of a cannon but it wasnt safe so brittany  now we get to see what they look like in street clothes  finn broke up with rachel because she made out with puck  but then quinn kissed finn after the big game  even though shes been dating sam yikes  it used to be a love triangle and now its like a pentagon  and thats what you missed on glee  we all know im not the smartest guy in the world  but there are two lessons i learned the hard way  one never punch a cop  the other one you cant choose love  love chooses you  i mean i could have any girl i wanted but  here i am in the middle of geometry  or english or something  and the only girl ive got my eye on is  a whole lot of woman  i owe it all to sectionals  we needed a 12th member and  i told her if she joined the glee club  id give her seven minutes in heaven  but what went down in that janitors closet was epic  youre really not good at this and youre kind of scrawny  you got to be kidding me  yeah youre not turning me on at all  later sad sack  but that was only three minutes  three minutes ill never get back  maybe its because shes constantly  insulting me like my mom  maybe i just dig a chick with curves  but its almost valentines day and its official  stare at me again and ill break your nuts  also  these candies you gave me  they sucked  but you ate all of them  i had to make sure they all sucked  im in love with lauren zizes  its amazing what actually accomplishing something  does to a person  i know what youre thinking that theyre all only into me  because i won the first conference championship  in this schools history but ive changed  im walking taller carrying a bigger stick  and using it to fight off the ladies  i love you finnybear  thanks becky  oh be my valentine  awesome  ill keep you posted  copy that  yeah ive been collecting a lot of hearts lately  only question is which one to choose  bingo  i just need to go for this  maybe the reason it never worked out with rachel  was because i was never over quinn  i know i can pry her away from sam  if i can get her to kiss me again  the ridiculous thing is that i could get every girl  in this school to kiss me but her  game on  okay im all for flair  but these valentine day decorations are just tacky  i mean what the hell is this supposed to be  its clearly puppy love  its cute come on  ooh  i love you  oh this is creepy adorable  its a simple excuse  to sell candy and greeting cards on a holiday  not true  people have been celebrating valentines day for centuries  and call me a hopeless romantic but its my favorite holiday  really  i think theres something really great about a day  where youre encouraged to just lay it all on the line  and say to somebody im in love with you   you know  and this year i want to do something really radical  so i need your opinion on this  well theres this guy that i sort of like  and ive only known him for a little while  but i want to tell him that i think  my feelings are starting to change into something  deeper  so i have to ask  do you think its too much  to sing to somebody on valentines day  not at all  what can i get you  uh a medium drip and a grande nonfat mocha for this guy  and maybe i can get him to split one of those cupid cookies  you know my coffee order  of course i do  thatll be 840  dont even bother dummy  its on me  keep the change  i do believe i have a new favorite holiday  all right guys i have one word for you  brittany  is it love  im totally going to graduate now  valentines day is coming up  so for this weeks lesson  i want you guys to pick a partner  because youre going to sing to them  what you think is the worlds  greatest love song  yeah find a song  that communicates  all the things that love means to you  now partner up mr shue can i say something  i just wanted to point out that  for the first time an entire week has gone by without  any one of us getting slushied  i think the fact that i led the football team  to a conference championship  might have something to do with it  fact is that im the closest thing  that this glee club has to a celebrity right now  and just like a famous athlete  i want to give to a charity  you guys  so im setting up a kissing booth  for a dollar a smooch and donating the proceeds  to glee club to help us  dont even act like youre trying to help this  glee club out you just want to kiss a bunch of girls  ive kissed finn and can i just say  not worth a buck  i would however  pay a hundred dollars to jiggle one of his manboobs  do you ever get tired of tearing other people down  no not really cause you always  just seem to do be meddling in everybody elses business  oh please you guys love me  i keep it real and im hilarious  actually youre just a bitch  whoa okay im sorry whoa  youve just got eyes for my man  okay first of all im not your man  and finn is right  all you ever do is insult us  three weeks ago you said  you were disappointed that i didnt have a lizard baby  five minutes ago you said  mr shue belonged in a 12step program  wait what  youre addicted to vests  the truth is santana  you can dish it out but you cant take it  okay maybe youre right maybe i am destined  to play the title role in the broadway  musical version of willow but the only job  youre going to have is working on a pole  fine  santana  maybe try rocking back and forth  people do that in movies  no cause i just try  to be really really honest with people  when i think that they suck you know  yeah no one gets it  i suppose you want me to thank you  for sticking up for me today except that makes it seem  like i need somebody to stick up for me so  oh no no trust me  i i know you dont need me to stick up for you  i mean youre all kinds of tough  and mm its true  how about you let me take you  to breadstix for valentines day  do you seriously think its that easy  im not desperate so if you really want this  you best come correct  because i spell woman zizes  and i need to be wooed you understand me  wooed  damn  hey  what you doing  nothing  just uh daydreaming plotting weekend outfits  well come on  youre going to want to see this  ive called an emergency meeting  of the warblers council  oh sounds serious  lets hope not  i just need to ask them a tiny little favor  this emergency meeting is called to order  junior member blaine anderson the floor is yours  esteemed council ill be brief  simply put  im in love  ooh  congrats  im not really good at talking about my feelings  im much better at singing them  but still i could use a little help  which is why im asking to enlist the warblers  to help serenade this individual  in song  offcampus  what what  offcampus are you serious  did i hear you right  i i know what im asking is slightly unusual  the warblers havent performed  in an informal setting since 1927  when the spirit of st louis overshot the tarmac  and plowed through seven warblers  during an impromptu rendition of welcome to ohio lucky lindy   why would we even consider  what youre asking  i firmly believe that our reticence  to perform in public  nearly cost us a trip to regionals  were becoming privileged  porcelain birds perched on a  on a gilded shelf you mock us sir  thad david  i will have order may i please say something  with respect i believe blaine has a point  the warblers are so concerned with image  and tradition that sometimes i feel like  we miss out on opportunities to step outside our comfort zones  when i was on new directions  we performed in front of hostile crowds  pretty much anywhere we went  i mean mattress stores shopping malls  i had a cat thrown at me in a nursing home once  but itit gave us confidence  itit kept us loose  and where would this performance take place  the gap at the north hills mall  id like to call it  the warblers gap attack  why the gap  the guy that i like is a junior manager  all right well all those in favor  i was absolutely devastated  i know something about   did he ever actually say you two were dating  well not in so many words  well did he put the moves on  no but we were always singing duets  and he was always smiling at me  the very part of you   oh my god i made up the whole thing in my head didnt i  listen weve all been there  at least i have  with you i know exactly what you mean  i mean if finn thinks  that hes just gonna walk out of my life  hes wrong cause im gonna go up  to that kissing booth tomorrow  with a 100 bill and hes not  gonna be able to make change  and then hes gonna be forced  to kiss me 100 times and when his lips touch mine  im telling you  hes gonna feel it hey hey  were supposed to be giving kurt advice remember  yeah  you are going to the gap attack though right  shouldshould i  yes mmhmm  scope out the competition  see what this guys like  you know you two are both so guy crazy  yeah look at me  i dont have a date for valentines day  and i could give a rip  the three of us are divas  look at our idols  whitney barbra patti lupone  they all became stars while they were single  they took all the pain  and loneliness and they put it into their music  people could relate to it  yeah everybody feels lonely  harnessing this pain is why they became legends  why has this never occurred to me  sometimes you have to choose between love and talent  and as far as im concerned  we all need to fly solo for a while  oh yeah   oh i know something about love   its so nice to be around girls for a change  oh here move over  are you gonna take me home tonight   ah down beside that red firelight   are you gonna let it all hang out   fatbottomed girls   you make the rockin world go round   hey   i was just a skinny lad   never knew no good from bad   but i knew love before i left my nursery   left alone with big fat fanny   she was such a naughty nanny   hey big woman you made a bad boy out of me   ive been singing with my band   cross the water cross the land   i seen every blueeyed floozy on the way   hey  whoo  but their beauty and their style   went kind of smooth after a while   take me to them lardy ladies every time   come on   oh wont you take me home tonight   oh down beside your red firelight   are you gonna let it all hang out   fatbottomed girls you make the rockin world go round   yeah  fatbottomed girls   you make the rockin world go round   get on your bikes and ride   ooh yeah   oh yeah   them fat bottomed girls  fatbottomed girls   yeah yeah   yeah   high five  good job  so um whatd you think  it was thats kind of my love song to you  cause you know youre a little  on the heavier side but  like the song says you know  im kind of into it  so  that was the first time anyone ever sang me a love song  and it made me feel like crap  i want tongue  uh thanks becky  oh  sorry ladies  brush and floss time  got to keep up the oral hygiene  if im gonna satisfy all of you sorry  i know why youre doing this  you know im the only girl in school  that wont kiss you and you think  that the peer pressure will get to me  well it is sort of uncool that you youre too uptight  to spend a buck for a good cause like glee club  im not kissing you again  what are you so afraid of  leading you on hurting my boyfriend  your boyfriends a boy  tell me you dont want to kiss me right now  i cant do this  i saw it  your guys faces were like  right up next to each other  kissing distance  what are these things  theyre called records  people used to listen to music on them  im looking for a classic love song to sing to you  for our assignment because despite your confusion  about the matter you are the only guy  im ever within kissing distance of  okay so answer me this then  why havent you kissed finn at his booth yet  okay first youre all up in my business for kissing finn  and now youre pissed at me for not kissing  its odd something seems fishy  i mean this is insane  shh  everyone thinks im dumb  not everyone  but im not  at least not about you  you play it cool but youre ambitious  you like being the queen bee  and you think being with star quarterback finn is going to  put you up there whether youre wearing  a cheerios uniform or not im pretty but i aint dumb  fine right after glee rehearsal  im kissing finn  thanks  are you sure you can handle this  oh absolutely  ive decided that im better off without you

than just a song to get my juices flowing  lauren zizes will you go  to breadstix with me tomorrow night  tomorrows not valentines day  tomorrows the predate  cause our mouths are going to be too busy macking out  on valentines day to eat anything  i like your style puckerman  i dine at 800  now get out of here before i change my mind  yeah  goodbye  sorry i was at church  praying for the strength to come  not to  you realize this is making me a cheater  the thing that hurt you so badly  that it made you break up with me  and rachel  you know why it hurt so bad when you guys cheated on me  cause it meant you didnt love me  thats not true no at least not enough  to not want t to hurt me and thats the thing about cheating  when you really love someone youd do anything  to keep them safe  i love sam  no you dont  or else you wouldnt have come here  fine  i think i love him  no matter what happens between us  im not going to break up with sam  until i know for sure one way or another  okay  do you think you can love two people at one time  not totally  you have to choose eventually  not yet  dont they have anything here  that isnt covered with stupid little hearts  gross  well youve certainly changed your tune  i dont think ive ever made that big a fool of myself  which is really saying something  because ive performed at theme parks  i just i cant believe  i made it all up in my head  okay can i ask you something  because weve always been completely honest  with each other  you and i we hang out  we sing flirty duets together  you know my coffee order  was i supposed to think that that was nothing  what do you mean  i thought the guy that you wanted to ask out  on valentines day was me  oh wow  i really am clueless  look kurt  i dont know what im doing  i pretend like i do  and i know how to act it out in song  but the truth is  ive never really been anyones boyfriend  me neither  let me be really clear about something  i really really care about you  but as you and about 20 mortified shoppers saw  im not very good at romance  i dont want to screw this up  so its just like when harry met sally  but i get to play meg ryan  deal  dont they uh get together in the end  could i get a nonfat mocha and a medium drip  for my friend billy crystal  ah you know my coffee order  you know what  i think ive got something for us to do on valentines day  thanks for doing this  it really takes the sting off  its cool my dads a drug addict  so losers make me horny  im not a loser  this is the first time ive ever been stood up  must be some chick to blow you off  michelle ive been covering your section for 15 minutes  your breaks over  and your husband called  well i did it  i kissed every girl in this school  and raised 324 for the glee club  all right finn thanks  thatll pay for half a ticket to nationals  so  still a long way to go  all right  okay  now i believe its time to hear  what the worlds greatest  love song means to ms tina cohenchang  come on up whoo  is anyone else hot  its really stuffy in here  this is for you mike  happy valentines day  my funny valentine   sweet comic valentine   you make me smile with my heart   your looks are laughable   unphotographable   yet youre my favorite work of art   is your figure less than greek   is your mouth a little weak   when you open    are you smart   stay oh oh god valentine   stay   every day is valentines day  when im with you  that was good thank you  okay wow that was powerful  almost too powerful  mr shue can i be excused i dont feel well  me either i feel sick  let me guess  you have a sore throat and your glands are swollen  and youre feverish  yeah yeah which is why i need to go to the nurse  it sounds like you have mono  otherwise known as the kissing disease  but you know what really helps spread it  a little tongue  which is weird because  it sounds like quinn here has it too  i was there when they kissed  it was just a peck  so how about we stop talking about tonguing  and finn and i go to the nurse  you know what i think that is a capital idea  ive cheated twice in my life  the first time i got pregnant  the second time i got mono  i think the universe is trying to tell me something  maybe  but i think sam likes you enough  to believe whatever story you told him  santana is such a bitch  it looks like mono to me  i called your mothers  you can hang here till they pick you up  but no kissing  im not done with us yet  you have to stop  nothing can happen between us until i figure out  whats going on with me and sam  and you figure out whats going on with you and rachel  but nothings  nothings going on with me and rachel  all i know is that when i dont catch you staring at me  youre staring at her  hello lauren  whats with the chilly willy puckerman  honestly im not used to getting stood up  last night  breadstix  oh we had a date didnt we  look i get it  youve been hurt by guys before  but im telling you im not like that  first of all you got a girl pregnant last year  so yeah you are  and b what makes you assume guys treat me badly  i can take care of myself  thats what i like about you  im not into you because you have curves i  what i like is that youre a girl  whos an even bigger bad ass than me  can i be honest with you  i like you i used to think you were smokin but a lot of that  had to do with the fact that i thought you were  mixed race and that never fails to get me going  but heres the thing puckerman  im not just looking for somebody to fool around with  so if youre really into me you got to take it slow  i suppose i could give that a shot  then youre on for valentines day  as friends  wheres quinn  uh  uh her mom picked her up a few hours ago  quinn really is very pretty  you dont have to do that you know  no i would do it for anyone  shes prettier than me  would you stop  youre beautiful  i know she is  it meant so much to me that you chose me over her  girls like me dont get chosen over girls like her very much  did you kiss her  like santana said  yeah yeah but ii just needed to get it out of my system  so what did it feel like  when you kissed her  fireworks  did you see fireworks when you kissed me  rachel wait  no  its good thank you  look youve given me  the strength to move on  i know now that theres nothing here for me anymore  thats not the truth  i still im just  im so confused in my head right now  no its okay look i understand  now im free  to pursue my dreams without anything holding me back  and youve actually inspired my song selection  for this weeks love song assignment  feel better finn  do you ever feel like a plastic bag   drifting through the wind   wanting to start again   do you ever feel   feel so paper thin   like a house of cards one blow from caving in   do you ever feel already buried deep   six feet under screams   but no one seems to hear a thing   do you know that theres still a chance for you   cause theres a spark in you   you just gotta ignite the light   and let it shine   just own the night   like the fourth of july   cause baby youre a firework   come on show em what youre worth   make em go oh oh oh   as you shoot across
