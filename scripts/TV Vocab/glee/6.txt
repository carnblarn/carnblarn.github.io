nurse  well i need a favor  ookay  go to the drugstore and get me a couple of boxes  of decongestant  im running low and i want the children at mckinley  to be healthy and happy  uh hhow many boxes  um  thirtysix  groans  whimpers  hey terri  oh hi ken whats up  can we talk frank  uh  listen  we have a problem  i think my girlfriend is in love with your husband  and i wouldnt be surprised if the feeling was mutual  how long has this been going on  i dont know a couple months  i see them together all the time laughing talking  all the stuff she never does with me  you know i knew something was up  she couldnt keep her eyes off him  at those acafella clown shows  listen has will ever mentioned it to you  oh no but hes too smart for that  i mean just barely but still  oh ken i got to be honest with you  i only took this job  so that i could keep an eye on him  weve got to put a stop to this so that i can get out of here  see im not built to work five days a week  well ive been thinking  maybe that if you and i started seeing each other on the side  it might kind of cancel their thing out  are you two still having sex  because you know when that stops something is up  we actually havent um had sex yet  she doesnt like to be touched  by me  oh  god i love her so much  oh uh  okay  crying softly  its okay  there there  look at the two of us  laughs  you pregnant and me with psoriasis oh  and one testicle that wont descend  i dont know who to feel more sorry for  okay thats enough  you know what you got to stop being such a baby  i cannot fix this unless you are willing to man up  okay im sorry  sighs  gasps heres what youre going to do  youre going straight to the nearest department store  to buy her an engagement ring  then youre going to get down on one knee  and youre going to ask that doeeyed little harlot  to marry you  no i cant do that  what if she says no  it might kill me  take two of these  then nothing can stop you  i told you guys  we know  youve been berating us for the better part of an hour  were they really that good  they were quinn look i was fine with arranging  choreographing and directing this number free of charge  but we underestimated the boys  their number will go to sectionals and once again  i will be humiliated  how were we supposed to know theyd rock the house  theyve never been good  how did they dddo it  the real question is what were they on  though ive been grouped with the boys  my allegiance still remains with you ladies  they declined my offer to do their hair in cornrows  and all my artistic decisions have been derided as too costly  because they involve several varieties  of exotic bird feathers    my man got next weeks plays all worked out  yeah hey mr shue got that paper  on bariloche argentina on your desk  but its not due for two weeks  damn straight i am in the zone  cheater  i dont know what youre talking about  you took performance enhancers before your mashup  kurt told me  its deplorable contemptible  and its just plain wrong  its also cheating as a matter of fact  im going to start calling you frod  hey hey back off im nothing like arod okay  id never take steroids  they make your junk fall off  listen rachel you dont know what its like for me  the kind of pressure im under  oh we all have pressures but you know how i deal with it  the natural way with a rigorous diet and exercise routine  beeping  aint nothing gonna hold me down playing  rachel im up at 600 am every day  i have my protein shake with banana and flaxseed oil  and by 610 im on the elliptical  you know how i motivate myself  not with anything artificial  i set a goal  and i wont rest until i reach it  yeah well thats personal pressure  if you dont meet your goal youre the only one who loses  i have to be the quarterback the male lead and deal with  a pregnant girlfriend who yells at me about ice cream  so yeah maybe i helped me and my teammates out a little bit  but its only because im sick and tired  of working so hard and still losing  yeah but winning by cheating isnt winning  oh dont give me that  the only reason youre so pissed about this  is cause you know you cant compete with us  oh i am offended by that accusation  we havent performed yet but if i may say  our mashup is spectacular  still isnt going to be as good  were gonna win youre gonna lose  deal with it  everyone gets a dose  oh except for quinn you get folic acid  mama  quietly its good for the baby  get the lead out howard  we have patients waiting  are you sure we should be doing this  oh its overthe counter its safe  you can trust me  im a nurse  its good for you  whirring buzzing  whats up with ken  doesnt he have a healthy glow  i put him on a new vitamin regimen  is that safe  i mean youre not really a nurse terri  dont start criticizing my work will  not when im just getting my sea legs  sighs  isnt this nice  i mean when is the last time  we got to have lunch together on a weekday hmm  oh honey you have a little mustard  just  geez terri  this is my workplace im sorry honey  its just that my hormones are going really crazy for you  hey look look  you being here is not good for our marriage  spending time together is not good for our marriage  not every minute  theres no separation  i mean we used to come home every night  and talk about our day  now we have nothing to say to each other  a lot of ants on the sidewalk today  pretty late in the season for that  i think this is just forcing us  to expand our intellectual horizons  sighs  where are you going the bathroom  ill come with you no  i love you but i need my space  mmm  nows your chance ken  what here now yeah  hi emma hi ken  what are you doing  look emma i know our relationship  hasnt been perfect

picture of us at the state fair every night  before i go to sleep  oh my god oh my god oh my god  this isnt happening this is a dream  emma pillsbury this is not an engagement ring  oh thank goodness no i mean it is  but its more than that its a promise  look emma i know you have this thing about being clean  now i cant promise to pick up my underwear  or squeegee the shower door  but i can promise to keep your life clean of sadness  and loneliness  and any other dark clouds that might float into it  its cubic zirconia  i know how affected you were by black diamond  emma pillsbury eminem  will you marry me  sighs  thank you so much it really is a pleasure  while the boys chose a selection of songs that cast  an eye inward on the irresponsible  life choices and sexual hunger of todays modern teens  we have chosen a selection of songs that speaks  to the nation as a whole during these troubling times  filled with economic uncertainty and unbridled social woe  because if theres two things america needs right now  that is sunshine and optimism  also angels  gasping for air  okay  intro to halo playing   oh    remember those walls i built    well baby theyre tumbling down    they

can you um  can you think of any other options i might have  sighs  is is that a reason to marry someone  thats not what im asking  bell ringing  footfalls approaching  emma  terri  um how are you  what can i uh  what can i  do for you  i just wanted to cut to the chase  things have been a little awkward since  i started working here i just wanted to clear the air  oh thats um  thats actually really nice why dont you just  you have no chance with my husband  do i make myself clear  oh you might think theres some kind  of competition going on between you and i  but thats like saying  that a nail is competing with a hammer  terri will is a good man  uhhuh  hes kind and hes generous  and he deserves a lot better than you  emma will is my husband  look at you  you are so superior because youre nice to a man  that you see for an hour or two a day  youre just an innocent  little dove hmm  youre so innocent that you would steal a man away  from his pregnant wife  yeah  do yourself a favor honey  marry ken tanaka  oh sure hes dumb like sand  and his fondue pot of nationalities  is gonna open your kids up to a host of genetic diseases  but hes kind and hes generous  and hes available  mrs schuester  mmhmm  i need to talk to you  about the baby  is everything okay  wait youre not having it right now are you  what no  arent you supposed to be a nurse  mmhmm  ive been thinking about your offer  yeah  i like my life  i like being a cheerleader  and i cant believe im actually saying this  but i really like being in glee club  i have all of these great things in my life  and it already feels like too much  whispers i cant raise a baby  you know honestly i dont even know how  you kids do it nowadays  i didnt have it this bad  when i was your age  there werent as many tv channels either though  is finn okay with this  cause you know i dont want any baby daddy drama  when you hand it over to me  hes the reason im doing this  hes such a good guy  and he internalizes all this pressure  hes gonna have a heart attack  i never want mr schuester to find out about this though  i dont want to hurt him either  well your secrets safe with me  i have a lot more to lose  one more thing  you know how you gave me those vitamins for the baby  mmhmm  i really appreciated that  but im gonna have all these doctors bills  and im gonna need some new maternity clothes  you want money from me  its gonna be your baby  which means im gonna be paying the bills for 18 years  i think you can handle nine months  look youre making the right call here quinn  its whats best for everybody  sighs  gasps softly  hi  hi  um i cant i cant stay long in this room  because of the germs you know  and because of the odor  but i have a question  anything for you emma  so what would um  what would getting married mean  exactly  because i would want to keep my last name  and id want to continue living in different parts of town  and um i think it would be best  if we didnt see each other after school  sure  and i wouldnt want a big ceremony you know  like in a church with people  we wouldnt have to invite anybody you know  or tell anybody actually  it could be more like a secret you know  like a secret marriage  thats actually a better deal than i expected  youre a really good man ken  and i dont want to spend  the rest of my life alone  and i know that you dont either  so  is that a yes  whats up arage  hey sweet mashup you guys were so energetic  we were just taking a lesson from major league baseball  its not cheating if everyones doing it  we were just leveling out the playing field  you really believe that  no  i feel terrible  even if we win its not gonna be satisfying  i know  i dont even remember performing  what do you think we should do  i think the only way to make things right  is to just withdraw from the competition  you know admit that we were wrong  and disqualify our respective teams immediately  no one gets to win  cool  im sorry about what i said the other day  about calling you contemptible and deplorable  ah thats all right  i didnt even know what those words meant  what i meant to say is that  i guess i get caught up in the competitive hysteria too  my goals are too selfish  you know its time for me to stop competing against everyone  and start competing alongside them  bell ringing  what the hell were you thinking  you gave drugs to my students  ill say it again  theyre overthecounter fdaapproved  and if i didnt give it to them im sure the kids  would just find a way to get it for themselves  no no they wouldnt  these are good kids  nothing bad happened  howard bamboo got arrested  well that  wait what  pseudoephedrine is an ingredient  in the manufacturing of methamphetamines  howard got picked up  by the feds on suspicion of running a crystal meth lab  i never told howard to get them all in one place  okay enough terri  how are we supposed to raise a baby  when i cant trust you to look after  a group of teenagers  you are oblivious to consequences  i was only trying to help you will  dont  every time i light a fire in my life  you find a way to make sure it burns the forest down  figgins i have serious concerns  about your judgment mrs schuester  i must ask you to resign as school nurse  fine  i was working too hard anyway  hold onto your horses shue  i have to question your judgment in the matter as well  what i had no idea this was even going on  exactly  the children rely on you to create the culture  and you with your obsession with winning  andand competition has fostered  an unsafe environment  im bringing in someone else to cochair the glee club  someone with a track record of responsibility and excellence  were really sorry mr shue  we didnt mean to get you into trouble  im really disappointed in you guys  glee is supposed to be about whats inside your heart  not whats coursing through your veins  we know and i think i speak for everyone when i say  that wed be happy to move forward  and put this episode behind us  well its not that simple  because of this debacle its been decided  that im no longer fit to run glee club myself  weve been assigned  a codirector  who  hey kids  chuckles i got to tell you  im just thrilled to be coming on board  to cocaptain your little uh showbiz cruise  ah i cant wait to start singing and dancing  and maybe even
