because you would try to steal all of my gold  okay uh anyway i got you this  i know everyones always making fun of your lips  but i think theyre cute and worth weatherproofing  so considering that were both single  and i think your lips are cute  i was wondering if you would go to to prom with me  as in your date yeah  no no no no as in  as in no prom oh  i dont think im going  are you worried that finn will be jealous  look youre just not my type okay rachel  so thanks for the lip chap  i feel like my life finally has purpose  its so nice to be a part of a cause thats bigger than myself  honey badger i am so thrilled  can i ask why youre dressed like david bowie  im incognito  were going deep behind enemy lines  people are starting to sense my weakness  they think ive totally lost my grip  can i help you oh yes  can i have a hot tea please  id just like a large cup of mocha powder  david bowies incredibly eccentric  um we dont take euros  so honey badger last week i had a revelation  now as you may or may not know  the middle east is in chaos  you know what started it all  no a little web site called wikileaks  you ever hear of them  well they let loose with a couple of rumors  so i told figgins  i wanted to resuscitate the muckraker  but the school newspaper was discontinued two years ago  due to lack of interest  the newspaper is making a comeback at this school  and like print newspapers everywhere  were leaner and meaner  no longer concerned with facts factchecking  integrity or facts  the muckraker motto  if i heard it its probably true or something  sorry but did you just change disguises  im pretty sure that baristas onto me  now im ann coulter  as you may have noticed im coming slightly unhinged  ohio loves you ann coulter  thats better sighs with relief  can i make an observation  youre always trying to destroy will from inside the glee club  but i would like to try getting him out of the glee club  now i was trolling the internet last night and i had an idea  ill drink to that  school bell ringing  excuse me  do you know where a gal can find  a pipin hot cup of will schuester  oh my god april  what are you doing here  i thought you were on broadway  i was my allwhite production of the wiz was a disaster   oh april im so sorry  dont be  being publicly humiliated by the new york times  gets me to thinking  why am i weighing myself down with the broadway classics  i should just tell my own story  so i wrote the libretto  to crossrhodes the april rhodes story  youre writing a musical  yep thats why im here  so will remember how i bought you your auditorium  oh yeah  well im gonna need to borrow it cause im running a little low on funds  extra extra read all about it  get your muckraker here  extra extra get your muckracker here  hey i think we should talk about nationals  we need to do a duet  i dont think thats a good idea  why are you so concerned  with quinns feelings  when she obviously has no interest in yours  what are you talking about  havent you read the muckraker  its our schools newspaper  look at the blind items column  what prom queen candidate is spending  a lot of time in her closet  now thats garbage quinns claustrophobic  no thats santana read the next one  what the hell is this dude  what blondie former cheerleader is having a secret moonlight motel rendezvous   with another biglipped blondie  where does it say that  right on the front page of the school newspaper  you dont seriously believe this do you  well why shouldnt i why wouldnt he do the same thing that i did to him  because its gossip finn  this is your fault  you told everyone that i played  for another team on your ridiculous melted cheese show  wait are you mad you do play for another team  you were on the cheerios and now youre only in the new directions  and you couldnt have thought of any other way to say that  i swear im going to punch your face off  hey you got a lot of nerve accusing me of cheating  when youre the one who snuck in and stole my girl  hey hey finn where are you going  hey we got rehearsal not today  dinner is served  giggles  i thought you volunteered to make dinner  well mama drinks her dinner these days  honk  uh chuckles can i be blunt with you april  glasses clink  i think any show about april rhodes  should be about your emotional journey  oh  hadnt really thought of that  i forget what a good teacher you are will  thanks  and lately i dont feel like it  i mean theres just so much drama in  the glee club right now more than usual  a lot of whispering and backstabbing and love triangles  and questions of sexuality  sounds like your clubs got a touch of the mac  the what fleetwood mac  they fought all the time  there was affairs and divorces  and whispers and gossip  all the stuff that made good bands break up  but they put all that drama to good use and wrote great music  you know i think i might have rumours on lp somewhere  oh everybody does  i mean i dont i sold mine for drugs  kidding ha nope  i actually did that  here we go  you know ive wanted to do a whole lesson devoted  to a single album for a long time  you know this is a really good idea april  and im here to help  dreams by fleetwood mac  now here you go again you say   you want your freedom   well who am i to keep you down   its only right that you should   play the way you feel it   listen carefully   to the sound   of your loneliness     like a heartbeat drives you mad    heartbeat     in the stillness of remembering    stillness     what you had    lonely   and what you lost   and what you had   and what you lost   thunder only happens when its raining   players only love you   when theyre playing   i say women they will   come and they will go   when the rain washes you clean youll know   youll know   youll know   youll know   rumours a classic record by fleetwood mac  one of the greatest albums of all time  written as the band was breaking apart  to keep it together  now this week we are done with the backstabbing and the gossip  and were channeling all that energy into working together  so pick a song from the album put your own spin on it  simple as that  whats going on with you and santana  nothing  it doesnt sound like nothing it sounds like something  which is almost always more than nothing  chuckles im down artie  are you cheating on me with her  no of course not i mean i cant shes a girl  fooling around with her isnt cheating  its just friends talking with their tongues super close   who told you that  santana  dont you see that shes manipulating you  thats not cheating either she told me that  do you see whats going on here  youre the hottest girl in this school  and i wear saddle shoes on legs that dont work  this shouldnt be happening  not because im in a wheelchair  but because im obsessed with angry birds  and my mom cuts my hair  i like your haircut  its hard enough for me to believe that this is real  if i know that you spend even  a little time sharing yourself with someone else  that theres one other person in your life that can provide  for you the things that im supposed to provide  its just too much for me to take  and santana knows that  shes taking advantage of it to break us up  no everybody thinks shes a bad person but shes not  god brittany why are you so stupid  you were the only person at this school that never called me that  playing never going back again  she broke down and let me in   made me see where ive been   been down one time been down two times   im never going back again   mmm mmmmmm   mmm mmmmmm   you dont know what it means to win   come down and see me again   been down one time   been down two times   mmm never going back again   mmm mmmmmm   stakeout  so exciting  its like an episode of hart to hart  no this is not fun or cool  then why did you agree to do it  because quinn cheated on me with puck  and then she cheated on sam with me  i just want to be sure  i never understood why you got back with her  i mean if you cant even trust her  i dont know  i do  because you forgive your first love anything  do you believe in that thing called karma  uh yeah  can you explain it to me  uh well its the law of physics  whereby for example  if you do something to hurt someone  well then the laws of the universe will work  against you until you get hurt  while were here have you given  any thought to my duet ideas  i cant believe kurt would do that to blaine  what do we know about sam anyway  i mean what town is he from what state  whats his old school like  maybe hes a serial killer you guys  im telling you kurt wouldnt cheat on blaine  its just like the rumours album  i mean being apart or on the road is hard for two artists  performers have this love the one youre with mentality  i mean look at all of us  look at all the different combinations that weve had  finnchel puckleberry  mctina cohen changchang artittany  pizes  guys were sitting here squabbling over what a rumor  finns right we need more information  i dont want to get into it  but all im gonna say sams not gay  god im so sad  like a sad little panda  well thats why i brought you here  to cheer you up  ive been going through that rumours album  and i found the best song that really goes  one step past landslide  in expressing my feelings for you  my private feelings  what about him  hes just furniture  sorry no offense  hit it  songbird playing  for you   therell be no more crying   for you   the sun will be shining   and i feel that when im with you   its all right   i know its right   and the songbirds are singing   like they know the score   and i love you i love you i love you   like never before   and i wish you all the love   in the world   but most of all   i wish it from myself   and the songbirds keep singing   like they know the score   and i love you i love you i love you   like never before   like never before   that was beautiful  okay so why couldnt you  sing that to me in front of everyone  now that artie and i arent together  no notnot yet  im not ready for that type of public announcement  ever since that muckraker thing  people have already started treating me differently  i got asked to join the golf team  well what if i went first  come on fondue for two  ill ask you out to prom  and ill tell you how i feel  and all you have to do is say yes  okay  yeah  stop it  stop what  i am begging you sam is cute  but hes not worth losing blaine over  oh how ive missed your insanity  hes wearing your jacket kurt  i remember that jacket you wore it april of last year  you said it was your earth day jacket  because it was made out of recycled hemp  i know how these things work  i remember when finn and i used to date  sometimes he would leave his letterman jacket at my house  and id wear it to school the next day  okay you need to bone up on your fleetwood macology  when they made rumours  they werent speaking to each other  not even pass the nondairy creamer  they only spoke about the music  and it was that focus that allowed them  to make their masterpiece  youre deflecting  no im being a team player and any minute spent  on this vicious hurtful and hateful gossip  is a minute taken away from preparing for nationals  why would she say that thing about sam not being gay  she was so sure about it  well they did date  yeah but the way she said it  there was something else going on  the problem with dating quinn besides the mood swings  is that shes so  protective about her feelings  you never quite know where you stand with her  girls like that do that to keep their power  you never did that  i always knew what you were thinking  door opens  and if you dont love me now   you will never love me again   i can still hear you sayin   you would never break the chain   never break the chain   mr shue thank you for being  my first interview  for the muckraker to be honest  i had no idea you were the journalist type  yeah i have a talk show on the internet  and the comments say that my questions are too gossipy  so i joined  the school newspaper to learn  to ask the more hardhitting questions  thats fantastic brittany  so question one boxers or briefs  uh boxers  cool  okay question two pantyhose or lace panties  i just said boxers  yeah well that wasnt one of the choices  so ill just write that you refused to answer the question  brittany these questions are sort of gossipy  okay what age did you start waxing your back  brittany i dont think these questions are very appropriate  well hardhitting journalism is about asking the questions  that people really want to know  um we need to address some rumors  how many students have you had affairs with  wait theres a rumor about that  there probably will be now  since you didnt really answer the question  none  is it the truth or are you lying like when  you didnt give me a straight answer about the lacy panties  brittany im sorry but i need to work on some songs  are they songs for april rhodes onewoman show  yes is it because youre leaving the new directions  what because theres a rumor that youd rather be on broadway  than coaching the glee club  brittany who gave you these questions to ask me  coach sylvester said im not at liberty to say  she told me this before she finished writing these questions  i thought so  all right muckrakers the rumor mill is up and running  on to lesson two  making stuff up  jacob i want you to squeeze this toothpaste into your hand  now put it back in  um i cant  exactly  oh no i didnt oh  sue fantastic azimio  now my point ladies and gentlemen is that  once a story is out its out forever  you cant put it back in  all right muckrakers we have a deadline  bell ringing all right get out of my classroom  get out of here  brett sue what are you doing  why are you spreading rumors that im leaving mckinley  well william im sure you dont dispute  that legendary bratwurst gobbler april rhodes is in town  and youre helping her get back to broadway  am i right of course  but it doesnt mean im leaving the school  let me ask you something will why  you know what they say those who cant teach  turns out maybe you actually can  think about that next time you prop your butt chin up on  one of those tiny little face toilets  look at it this way will  youd finally be rid of me  extra extra read all about it  get you muckraker here  i vote for quinn  bite me fabray  finn  wait why are you storming  im the one who should be storming  really because the way i see it im the stormer  and you should be the stormee  according to todays paper finn and rachel  were seen sitting closely laughing talking intimately we were on a stakeout  what were you doing with him in that motel  im not cheating on you  this time around i havent and i wont  you have to learn to trust me  i cant trust you if you wont tell me the truth  well what were you and rachel doing together huh  staking out thats what you do on a stakeout  what were you talking about glee club okay  she wants to do a duet with me thats all trust me  well then i guess we both have to learn to trust each other   i guess so  and i guess i know what song well be singing this week in glee club  i dont want to know the reasons why love keeps   right on walking on down the line   i dont want to stand tween you and love honey   i just want you to feel fine   i dont want to know the reasons why love keeps   right on walking on down the line   i dont want to know the reasons why love keeps   right on walking on down the line   i dont want to stand tween you and love honey   i just want you to feel fine   finally baby   the truth has been told   now you tell me that im crazy   thats nothing that i didnt know   trying to survive   oh you say you love me but you dont know   you got me rockin and areelin   hey you know what you do   oh oh yeah   uhhuh   i   i dont want to know   song ends  scattered applause  okay terrific job guys  um might want to try to smile  a little bit more next time though  yeah it was lovely but i prefer  quinns duet performance of lucky with sam better  since you and sam have become a lot closer lately maybe  you guys should do duets together more often  where is sam  quinn and kurt are both here today  so we know hes not doing the dirty  i know what youre doing  you want finn and i to stop singing together  so that you can sing with him again  frankly yes finn and i have amazing proven harmonies  and when it comes to nationals  i think it makes more sense  for him to be paired with me  well its not happening  not as long as finn wants to be with me  wait i thought you said this relationship was about trust  oh i trust you i just dont trust her  quinn i dont think you can mandate  who pairs up for nationals all right  vocal adrenaline doesnt need any help from us  i love being here and i want to win  but my relationship comes first  im sorry but finn  if you want to be with me no more songs with her  what  school bell ringing  finn scoffs  orchestra plays lush intro  we took a cab back to my bachelor pad   i had a feeling i would see this thing through   my doorman stan he took you by the hand   as he said right this way you two   but you said   stanley glover   you were once my lover   its april   yeah i guess i slept with you   because my name is april rhodes

broadway stage  and who knows whos gonna come and see it  what great notices you might get  you deserve to at least try this will  yeah i  i cant do that to the kids  not now we  weve all worked so
