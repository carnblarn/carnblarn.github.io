                that was important i need applause to live  but then finn introduced her to a friend who showed her  that theres a lot worse things to lose than your voice   i compensate with humor  and thats what you missed on glee  bell ringing hey you wanted to see me  william theres someone id like to introduce you to  hes the newest member  of our school board  and hed like to speak to you  will schuester meet mr bryan ryan  weve met  will bryan ryan  we went to school together and he made my life a living hell  he was two years older  dated every girl i liked  got every solo    cheer up sleepy jean      oh what can it mean      to a daydream believer      and a homecoming queen    whats the matter schuester cat got your talent  forced chuckle  im here to do an audit of our curriculum will  we may need to cut some of our districts  art programs its really just  a formality william  no its not well probably cut the glee club  what  butbut you were in the glee club  show choir was your life  it was will  and after i graduated i hit the big time  i was a featured soloist  at kings island in the doobledeedoo musical revue  we were a smash  then for three years  i did the cruise ship circuit  but when that dried up  i realized i had been sold a bill of goods  nine years later  i woke up on a urinestained mattress  in the west lima crack district  then  something amazing happened  i was introduced to jesus  he was my honduran social worker  i straightened up  put down the pipe  met the love of my life wilma  and now i run a successful used hummer dealership  dont make that face  global warmings a theory  exhales  and four nights a week  i run a show choir conversion group  hi im brenda  and its been 42 days since i sang a show tune  group hi brenda  years ago when i auditioned to play  miss adelaide in guys and dolls  i was asked to take my top off  evidently that is not customary  and thats when i started huffing glue  my name is russell im a glee club survivor  whenever anything bad would happen  i would just say lets put on a show  well guess what  puttin on a show  about your fathers prostate cancer  voice cracking will actually just make him more depressed  about the situation  show choir kills  i just want to have a talk with your kids  make sure youre not building up their hopes  just to have them knocked down  what if i say no  just let him speak to the kids william  let mr bryan ryan contribute to the marketplace of ideas  whats the worst that can happen  will okay guys listen up  this is mr ryan  hes a member of the school board  and he would like to say a few words  ii just want you guys to listen critically  and know that what hes saying  is just one of many opinions  take out a piece of paper  and on that paper i want you to write down  your biggest dream  a dream that means so much  youre afraid to admit it even to yourself  your dream is never going to happen   will spend your entire lives living in allen county ohio  so unless you wrote down that your dream was  to work for a midmarket health insurance provider  or find an entry level job in an elderly care facility  youre going to be very disappointed  this is really depressing  im going to guess that a lot of your dreams  involve showbiz  well let me tell you  showbiz dreams are the most unrealistic of them all  but thats what i want to do with my life  oh look im not trying to hurt your feelings  im just trying to spare you disappointment  i think we get your point  aw well schuester heres a prime example  he used to have that glimmer of hope in his eyes  that i can see right now in all of yours  but he couldnt make it happen for himself  so he now has to try and convince you all  that it will happen for you  guess what  his dream didnt work out  and neither will yours  sobbing  okay youre done here  you would be wise to show me some respect  youve said your piece  now get out  well schuester i should thank you  youve made my decision about which program to cut  a lot easier bell ringing  thanks  godard on godard  he was the master of the french new wave  i was figuring that since im never going to become a star  as a performer maybe i could become one behind the camera  did you know christopher reeve directed a movie  after his accident in the gloaming  didnt see it  oh me neither too depressing  is that what you wrote as your dream  before bryan ryan crumpled it up and tossed it in the trash  yes  why are you lying to me  after everybody left  i went back for my book bag  and something stopped me  that was supposed to be private  i dont understand you  youre always talking about wanting to get with me  but you wont be honest with me about your hopes and dreams  im in a wheelchair but im still a guy  whats the difference  im never going to actually become a dancer  my legs are never going to work again  it was stupid  i was thinking  mr shue is so busy dealing with bryan ryan  that he didnt give us an assignment for the week  so why dont we do one on our own  a dance number  you want to dance with me  you were pretty hot in proud mary  why dont we try and kick it up a few notches  hi  hi  how was your spring break  good  its good to be back  what were you just rehearsing  a guy came to glee club to talk to us about dreams  luckily ive known mine since i was four  im going to play three parts on broadway  evita funny girl and laurey in oklahoma  i was just practicing her dream ballet with curly  its what i do when im feeling a little stressed  thats not a dream  a dream is something that fills up the emptiness inside  the one thing that you know if it came true  all the hurt would go away  you singing dont cry for me argentina  in front of a soldout crowd isnt a fantasy  its an inevitability  chuckles  i thought youd never come back  and miss all your drama  never  bell ringing  so what is it your dream  i dont know  well then go inside find it and ask it what its gonna take  why are you pushing this  because youre my girlfriend  and i want to know all your secrets  when you lie awake at night whats missing  my mom  your mom  you mean like you want to meet her  i just would like to know who she is  i dont really need to meet her or anything  but maybe just find out her name or something about her  hmm  its silly  its not like its going to happen or anything  why  well just because my dad never told me anything  and i didnt want to ask them anything  cause i didnt want to hurt their feelings  so lets check it out without them knowing  do you know why i came back to school here  to win another national title  and make all your dreams come true  if this is one of them  then im not going to stop until it happens  piano playing lively tune  wheels make tap shoelike tapping sound  boombox beeps shuts off  my tap wheels suck  i thought we sounded pretty good  you did  i sound like someone put tap shoes on a horse  and then shot it  will you bring me those  i borrowed them from john hubner  the kid with cerebral palsy  theyre his extra pair  help me get up on them  have you ever used anything like these before  no but i have superhuman upper body strength  from using my wheelchair  if i can just get up  i think i can use my arms to get around the room  come on you said  we were going to kick it up a notch  dreams arent supposed to be easy  im going to try to take a step  okay  youre doing it  are you okay  go away  let me bring your chair over  just go away  you shouldnt have done this to me  you pushed me to do this  im sorry  just go away please  sniffles  bell ringing  hey bryan  hello will  just taking stock of the home ec supplies  you see our home ec program  teaches practical skills like food service preparation  cant feed a child sheet music will  i mean i suppose you could for a while but  theyd be dead in a month  id like to buy you a beer  oh  no no  i want to convince you that youre wrong  you wont  then for old times sake  i found her  your mother where  in the library  ive been researching her all morning and as i suspected  my intuition has been proven correct  my mother is broadway legend patti lupone  ive always had a deep connection  to ms lupone her choice of roles and songs  i decided to do a little math  to see if her being my mother was even possible  i was born december 18 1994  1994 was a big year for mother  she was a sensation in pal joey  but that was in new york i was born in ohio you say  well mother took many breaks  from the show to tour with mandy patinkin  that april found them at the ej thomas hall  in akron ohio for a standing room performance  nine months before i was born  are you saying that your fathers impregnated patti lupone  in the marriott in akron  was mandy patinkin in on this  all you have to do is look at pictures of her  in her performance in master class in 1996  look at the pain in her eyes and the hurt shes feeling  from giving up her obviously talented little girl  one question what was in it for her  mmoney a sense of charity for those in need  i dont know  guess youre right  do you want to hear my research  that proves that my mother is bernadette peters  why are you so afraid about finding the truth  i dont know i guess i just dont want to think  that my mother is some teenage trollop like quinn  or worse some skanky girl who would do anything for money  including giving me up why does it  have to be one of those choices  maybe she had a really good reason for doing what she did  we need to do a real investigation  like csi real  do you have  any baby stuff in your house  something that might give us a clue  my fathers kept every piece of paper  related to my life in files and cabinets in our basement  its sort of a little rachel berry museum  perfect  well start there  will you were a big deal at mckinley  dream weaver by gary wright playing quietly  you had all the moves  you were one of those dudes  where all the guys wanted to be you  and all the girls wanted you  not all of them  really  all right whwho was the one that got away  terri delmonico  you remember her  coughing  yeah  yeah she was she was cool  oh  i married her no way  yeah  it didnt really work out though  wow im sorry to hear that  she was great  ii really loved her  and you know just just grew apart  do you know what gave me the strength to  finally get out of a terrible marriage  music  meeting those kids  coaching glee club  no youre right  iim im never going to be on broadway  and maybe the same is going to go for most of those kids  but thats not the point  glee club  its not just about expressing yourself  to everyone else  its about expressing yourself to yourself  im living a lie  what  sniffles i miss it so much  i am miserable  ever since i stopped performing i cannot stand my life  three times a year i tell my wife  im going off to a business trip i sneak out to new york  i see a bunch of broadway shows  i have a box of playbills  hidden away in my basement will  like porn  sobs  chokes up  what are you doing  coin clinks  piano man by billy joel playing  you remember  sectionals 1992  you sang this song  alone on stage just you and a piano  i mean i i know this isnt quite as theatrical  but youre gonna sing it again right now  i cant  yes you can    its 900 on a saturday      the regular crowd shuffles in      theres an old man sitting next to me      making love to his tonic and gin    laughs    he says son can you play me a memory      im not really sure how it goes      but its sad and its sweet and i knew it complete      when i wore a younger mans clothes      la la la de de da      la la de de da da dum      sing us a song youre the piano man      sing us a song tonight      well were all in the mood for a melody      and youve got us feeling all right    whatever happened to you in the past its over  youve got to give it another shot  lima theatre guild is doing a production of les miz  auditions are friday  and both of us are trying out  all right oh oh okay  hey  sorry about yesterday  no im sorry  i do a pretty good job of being in denial  about the hopelessness of my condition  i think i just kind of freaked out  when i actually had to face it  who says its hopeless  like every doctor ive ever seen  maybe theyre the wrong doctors  i went online and did some research about  the new treatments on spinal cord injuries  did you know that some doctors are implanting  electrical stimulators in patients bodies  to recover hand movements  my hands work  theyre just starting to develop the technology  but in a year five years who knows  and some scientists at uc san diego were actually able  to regenerate a rats damaged spinal cord  there are hundreds of studies  going on right now using stem cells  i guess i just wanted to tell you  not to give up on your dream  if you can imagine it  it can come true  what took you so long  your dads will be home soon  there was so much stuff in the basement  its like a shrine  its creepy and flattering at the same time  but these boxes had the earliest dates on them so  gasps  my baby teeth  look  is that me  looks like you oh  i think youre in fifth position  makes sense my dad says they used to  play vivaldi into my mothers belly  put that there  gasps  my first singing competition  i came in first place

may have heard  i plan on making my return to the stage next month  in a local production of les miz  and ive had something of a personal awakening  so ive decided to examine all  of the extracurricular activities here at this school  and sue your cheerios budget is out of control  let me remind you of something mr ryan  the cheerios sell tickets  not enough to offset your costs  i am very tired of athletics always taking a back seat  when daily pe was cut at this school  no one batted an eye  but cut a dance program cancel the school musical  and suddenly theres an uproar  i did a little research sue  did you know that studies have shown that reading shakespeare  might help kids learn physics  that singing helps you learn pitch  which makes learning a foreign language easier  that when a kid picks up a clarinet or a trumpet  every region of the cerebral cortex is stimulated  well thats all very interesting  but did you know that a third of american teenagers are obese  and only 2 of high schools require any form  of daily physical activity  where is your outrage about that mr ryan  sports teach kids how to work together  teaches problem solving and social skills  it improves attendance not to mention grades  particularly among those students deemed  the most at risk  youve done your homework  im an educator  now i realize my methods are unconventional  but my record speaks for itself  is it a tad over the top to bill  the district for skydiving lessons  to have the cheerios parachuted onto the football field  perhaps  but what i do here makes a difference  sue youre an impressive woman  i cant tell you how much you turn me on right now  you ever heard of the term anger sex  its the only kind i know bryan  i should tell you im married not a problem for me  and im still cutting half your budget  you win some you lose some  should i lock the door  no got a secret room upstairs  like letterman  she has the tape  she wont listen to it  what  she has to listen to it  thats the point of all this  im doing my best  look when you told me to seduce her  befriend her was the word i used actually  whatever the thing is i was into it  because i thought it would be a good acting exercise  but now i think i kind of like her  i dont want her to get hurt  look one more week this will all be done  you can come back to vocal adrenaline where you belong  i dont understand why you dont just go up to her and say  hi my names shelby im your mom  i signed a contract  i cant contact her until shes 18  she has to come to me  thats why she has to listen to the tape  once she hears it  she wont be able to sleep until she finds me  i answered an ad in the paper  nine months work here would make me enough money  to live in new york for two years  her dads seemed like nice guys so i went for it  i never got to hold her  and i only saw her for a second when they were cleaning her off  it was through a bunch of nurses  but she turned her little head and she looked at me  ive failed as an actress  my walls are lined with trophies  instead of wedding pictures  but through all of of that  i only have one regret  you get her to listen to that tape  you know honestly  the only students that come and see me  on a scheduled weekly basis are ones  that have been diagnosed  with psychological disorders  like a certain junior female that eats her own hair  when i start walking  im gonna need help emotionally adapting  to my drastically altered lifestyle  walking  there are all these new therapies for my condition  i figure if i try them all ones bound to work  um  you know artie i have um  you know ive read your file before  um the damage  to your spinal cords pretty severe  irreversible  i think you know that  i used to know that  until i saw the research  do you know how long the testing process takes  for medical protocols like this  at least ten years  andand thats before they even start human trials  so you know these these studies  really arent even in their infancies yet  look ii truly believe that theres gonna be a doctor  that finds a cure for what happened to you  but i you know  i dont think thats gonna be for a long time  you know what um maybe youre right  maybe you should start coming to see me once a week  for a while  thanks ms pillsbury  dont forget your um papers  school bell rings  guys ive got good news  i siphoned off funds from the cheerios  and i took a little shopping spree  through the jazzhands catalogue  you know why  cause the arts matter  and i got custommade  new directions jean jackets  and some rad tearaway dancewear  hello  and every piece of sheet music  from every broadway show for the last 50 years  everything a show choir needs to become champions  wow thats just amazing  lets all give a hand for mr ryan  ryan thank you thank you  sue congratulations will  im over the moon for you  thanks sue im glad you have a good attitude  about your budget being cut  no no im not talking about that  i came over here to congratulate you on your new role  local director herb duncan  does the dry cleaning for the cheerios  and he let it slip  that you just landed the lead in les miz  congratulations  sue oh im ecstatic  and the good news just keeps coming  cause you got a part too bry  the exciting role  of townsperson  and you got a line too  way back here  in the second act you get to say  hooray  congratulations both of you really  i cant wait for opening night  will wait bryan  congratulations will  youre going to be great in the show  can we talk about this nothing to talk about  im cutting the program  hooray  hooray  hey bryan can i talk to you for a second  make it quick im rehearsing  you know reviewing my single line  i want to take one last shot  at convincing you not to cut the program  give it a rest will  you think youre helping these kids  when all youre doing is setting them up  to be jaded and bitter  youre right  cut the program and theyre certainly  more likely to turn out like you  ive grown weary of your insults will  they sting and they make me want to punch your face  sighing you remember high school  remember what its like  those kids get labeled the second  they walk through the door freshman year  geek punk  jock queer  ive seen who these kids in glee club really are  no labels no preconceptions their true spirits  yes most of them are not stars  but they shine like them  do you know what happens when a star dies bryan  it doesnt just disappear  it turns into this black hole this giant energysucking mass  that doesnt just collapse in on itself it takes away  any light that comes close down with it  you take away glee  youre not just putting out those kids lights  youre creating 13 black holes  sighs  i want you to take my part  you should play jean valjean  i want you to understand  how important the arts are for a persons soul  youre a black hole right now  maybe this will help you remember  what its like to be a star  so what youre saying is  youll give me the part if i dont cut the program  exactly  cool deal  oh hey sir hi  im your new lead and uh id just like  to set up some ground rules off the bat first of all  i have a lot of ideas and uh next  i dont really take direction  jessie what are you doing here  i said that i was going to help you  make your dreams come true  no im not ready  yes you are  i dreamed a dream plays  shelby on tape hi baby  its your mom  i think this pretty much says it all    i dreamed a dream      in time gone by      when hope was high      and life worth living      i dreamed that love      would never die      i dreamed that god      would be forgiving      then i was young      and unafraid      and dreams were made      and used and wasted      there was no ransom      to be paid      no song unsung      no wine untasted      but the tigers come at night      but the tigers come at night      with their voices soft as thunder      as they tear your hope apart      as they tear your hope apart      as they turn your dream      to shame      and still i dream      shell come to me      that we will live      the years together      but there are dreams      that cannot be      and there are storms      we cannot weather      i had a dream      my life would be      so different from this hell im living      so different now      from what it seemed      now life has killed      the dream      i dreamed    tina artie please think about this  i have  youve worked too hard on this routine  to have half a partner  fact is any of the guys in there
