                1 i know a place   where the grass is really greener   warm wet and wild   there must be something in the water   you can travel the world   but nothing comes close to the golden coast   california gurls   were undeniable   fine fresh fierce we got it unlocked   west coast represent   now put your hands up   hohohohoh oh ohohohohoh   california   california gurls   im bored  ladi i am at a loss  brittany please remind me  of how i singlehandedly put cheerleading on the map  in 1979 you directed a madefortv movie  about the dallas cowboy cheerleaders  called the dallas cowboy cheerleaders  that is correct  and in the meantime whats changed  personal grooming habits  whats changed is i have completely lost interest  and ladies i blame you  becky more silicone falsies  got it coach  you will each enhance your bust with an additional  pair of chicken cutlets  in an attempt to add some jiggle  to what is the most boring routine i have ever witnessed  but coach sylvester this is the most elaborate routine  the cheerios have ever done  were shooins at regionals next week  and were the favorite to win at nationals  and yet i am still so very bored  even things i used to think were hilarious  case in point  sandbags slap yourself with a chicken cutlet  now slap brittany  see not even a chuckle  the problem is you keep trying  to make a bigger and bigger spectacle  no matter how hard we try  we cant make a routine work unless you find a way  to make it interesting for you  you have to find a way to top yourself  q you just may have a point  but to be sure slap yourself with a chicken cutlet   all right i just want to take a minute  to tell you guys how proud of you i am  we didnt even have to win this game  to go to championship next week but nobody took it off  when we take a knee were gonna finish first in conference  for the first time in mckinley history  football is back bitches  maybe we should all break out into a song after we win  hey shut it karofsky no fricking way  i figure if i stay on you youll run away  like your little butt buddy hummel  thats funny karofsky  how youre calling everybody gay all the time  but you never seem to have a girlfriend  its okay its okay  i really hope that linebacker doesnt get the jump on me  i bet it would hurt like hell to get sacked by him  break team break  all right  slow left on one  ready break team break  come on boys lets go  down  set  whoo  growlin  hut  nice hands  what a joke  what the hell happened  finn youre the captain talk  karofsky sucks thats what happened  thats crap hudsons a frickin girl  and couldnt take a joke about his precious glee club  because im sick of you guys getting down on us for it  were in glee club whats the big deal  its embarrassing were dudes  getting all hot and bothered  about singing a keha song its freakin weird  yeah well maybe youll think its cooler  when i go all tik tok on your face  bring it puckerman  thats enough thats enough  championship game or not i am not blocking for him  get the hell out of here  fine go  good bunch of babies  dear journal i am in crisis  not even the cantlose combination  of boobs and fire can get me going anymore  is it the raccoon hormones my new doctor gave me  maybe  here i am 31 and already a legend  what do i do as a second act  im simply at a loss last week  i even took to modifying my own flawless form  just to feel something wait  its syvlester right sue syvlester  how do i make things interesting again  how do i get those juices flowing  thats it  this here is the a950  you say this could shoot someone across a football field  several football fields if you pack in enough explosives  of course that would be incredibly unsafe  see if you want to go for more than say 50 yards  youre looking about a 70 chance  of catastrophic failure  which is a 30 chance of catastrophic success  this is the button right no no no no  you know i try to make it a habit  of not touching carny folk but fella  ill take it  you got a smaller one  ill check stock  im back  so i was going through my bucket list  and i noticed you were the only glee loser  that i havent slushied yet  damn near broke his heart  well what about the moral implications  of abusing a kid in a wheelchair  i say equal opportunity for all  this stuff between the jocks and the glee club  has been going on since i started running the club  maybe  it just seems like its so much worse right now  ive won division championships at three different schools  you have to understand what winning means  to a community grades go up  the streets are cleaner crime goes down  its a sense of pride of unity  and this school deserves that  and you are going to get it for us  i mean you won almost every game this year  winning conference was easy  the team were up against for championship  theyre much better than us  if you dont have thtalent you re on the chemistry  they dont have to like each other  but they have to respect each other  this whole thing is just so weird  i mean half of your starters are in my glee club  i just dont know what to do  do you trust me  youre not going to try and kiss me again are you  if you trust me  i think i know a way to get your team united again  really fast  oh my god artie  it was awful  thats it screw rehearsal  this ends here and now  were gonna go all thunderdome on those guys  so this is what the ladies lounge looks like on the inside  this is the choir room now put up your fists  because you and i are going to do some dancing  no i got this sam  coach beiste told us to come where is she  watch it everyone have a seat  you too guys  all right new directions  lets give a warm welcome to the newest members of glee club  oh hell to the no mr shue  hey come on  guys hey  are you serious these are the guys that made kurt transfer  and theres no way that im sharing the choir room  with a known homophobe  i dont disagree with you guys  but i talked to coach beiste about it  and she and i both agreed that the kind of bullying  that david does is born out of ignorance  having him in here as difficult as it may be for us  is an opportunity to show him and the rest of the guys  that being in glee club is kind of cool  find some common ground  all of you are going to be in this glee club for one week  no exceptions  shes bluffing next week is the championship game  without us shhas no team  with you i have no team  you guys have gotta find a way to come together  or were going to get our asses kicked from here  until tuesday finds a saddlebag full of buckwheat  if i have to stay im not singing no show tunes  that is the music of my oppressors  do you even have any idea what we do in here  no none of them do  we have to show them  rachel puck havent you guys been working on something  why dont you give it a whirl  fine as offended as i am by their presence here  i wont let anything get in the way of a performance  picture perfect memories   scattered all around the floor   reaching for the phone   cause i cant fight it anymore   and i wonder if i ever cross your mind   for me it happens all the time   its a quarter after one   im all alone and i need you n   said i wouldnt call   but ive lost all control and i need you now   and i dont know how i can do without   i just need you now   another shot of whiskey   cant stop looking at the door   wishing youd come sweeping in   the way you did before   and i wonder if i ever cross your mind   for me it happens all the time   its a quarter after one   im all alone and i need you now   and i said i wouldnt call   but im a little drunk and i need you now   and i dont know how i can do without   i just need you now   the girl with the mohawk had a really nice voice  funny yeah man thats good  hey  hey get back  great first day right  awesome  let me at that guy   hey  hey  we used to be best friends  before i got your girlfriend pregnant  and then made out with your other girlfriend and  yeah  anyways i gotta be honest  i really want to win this game and i figure its the only way  us glee studs are ever gonna get any respect around here  whats your point  my point is that none of thats gonna happen  unless you and i become allies again like  maverick and iceman at the end of top gun  so whyd youing that duet with rachel  i need you to do this number with me to make finn jealous  nothing like that will ever happen again  you lead and i got your back  we need to win this championship and become legends  ladies my sueclear weapon  becky  brittany  climb on up  congratulations  youre doing this stunt for the big competition  i dont want to die yet  at least not until one tree hill gets cancelled  fine  to put your toddler fistsized mind at ease well do one  final test run  any of you take german  i may have to read  the owners manual  dont worry ill talk to mr shue and take care of this  sue what the hell were you thinking  you cannot perform a stunt that dangerous  our insurance premium is through the roof as it is  cheerleading is a sport  there are dangers involved  the same as when a quarterback  is sacked or a hockey player is  slammed up against the boards  enough sue  there is no excuse for putting a students life at risk  im a tastemaker will  i know what an audience wants  you are not going to take this away from me  i need this  this level of risk and danger makes me feel alive again  but the risk and danger isnt to you  thats the best part  enough its decided  you are not allowed to fire yone  out of that cannon without their consent  huh  its coming out of  your paycheck every penny of it  oh god its a lawsuit  im telling you i wish you could have seen it  sort of like that  what the hell are you doing  im seing a message  sue sylvesters done playing nice  i just got off the phone with the ohio cheerleading board  and they accepted my request to move my regional  to the same night as your championship game  congratulations  you just lost your halftime show and the cheerleaders  sue  what the crap are we gonna do now  i got it  no frickin way will we dont have a choice  sue pulled the cheerios from the game  so if we dont do it theres no halftime show  and this is a problem because  its not a problem its an opportunity  opportunity to humiliate ourselves beiste hey  the whole point of this week was to bring you guys together  to bring the school together wait so you want us  to play the first half change into some sequeen  ball gowns and then  go out and do the halftime show at our own championship game  yes its the championship game  this is a crazy town crazy  this is crazy what about the cheerios in glee club  they have a choice  us or the cheerios competition  well obviously quinn is gonna choose the cheerios i mean  well thats not fair you dont know what shes goa  i think the cheerleading competition  is gonna be a lot of fun but if you go  youre gonna miss out  on us doing the most iconic song of all time  the super bowl of pop anthems  thriller   yeah  yeah remember a few years ago  when that philippine prison did that  mega performance of thriller and put it on youtube  in the four months it took to rehearse that number  prisoneronprisoner crime dropped   doing that together as a team  created a unity within that prison  and thats what im looking to do here  i mean dont get me wrong you know  im big on michael and everything  but isnt that kind of what theyre expecting us to do  which is why were gonna mash it together  with the yeah yeah yeahs equally spooky single  heads will roll   whos yeah yeah yeah  all right new directions titans  were going to zombie camp  uh five six seven eight  time out  time out time out hey hey  knock it off  okay guys  its good but lets  put a little life into it  but were dead  then put some afterlife into it  t out of your heads and get into your aracters all right  very creative i like that  five six seven eight  all right nice progress guys  now lets take a breather and ill see you  in the choir room in five minutes  for a lesson in zombie makeup  makeup no no no no no no no  yes yes yes yes  yes yes yes hey dave  talk to you for a second  look i know im bad  can you just spare me so can we get through this  thats not what i was going to say at all  youre actually really good  if you took that energy  you used bullying people and put it into this  youd be one of most talented guys in the school  just think about it  makeup artist  i am brilliant  its actually decent  its all right  i took a makeup class  hey i need to talk to you  can we not fight for just one day  man its already hard enough  not to kick you in the nuts every time i see you  you think maybe we should do a warmup number or something  before we do that big thriller thing at halftime  you know i figure the only way im gonna keep any street cred  around here after dancing around like an idiot  in front of the whole school is if we kick ass at it  uh  yeah couldnt agree more  zombie camp was funner than i expected  and the glee club together with the football team  its like a double rainbow  a zombie double rainbow  what the hell are we gonna do  if we go to our cheerleading competition  then we miss the halftime show  and were out of glee club  im torn  oh im not im brittany  couldnt help but overhear your conversation  what were you doing in there  enjoying the eavesdropping afforded me  by the swisstimepiece regularity  and utter silence  of my 200 p m ninja poops  well i typed these up for you ladies  requiring your signature  tendering your resignation from the glee club  oh and brittany heres a note for you  handwritten and in crayon from the human cannon  saying how much it misses you  coach that cannon is going to get brittany killed  is that really worth it  just to win a stupid national champiohip  seventh consecutive stupid national championship  this is ridiculous you had quite a year last year q  and as i recall you didnt have such a good time  out of that cheerios uniform  ladies i am giving you the chance right now  to choose once and for all where your true loyalties lie  choose the cheerios  or choose the glee club  how the hell could you do this  oh dont get all up in my face finn  what were we supposed to do  uh quit cheerios  coach sylvester is awful to you guys  and dont forget who was there for you  the last time she dumped you on your ass us glee club  and you dont think that i feel awful about that  you dont need to be a cheerio to be cool  oh you are so naive  this whole school is about labels  wow i never realized you were sfreakin weak  oh i what did you say  all the cheerios quit glee club so why are you yelling  at my girlfriend about it  im yelling at her because  im the leader of this team  well maybe its time for a chge at the top  whats that supposed to mean this is kind of hot actually  it means that maybe the reason  everyone hates us is because we need some new leadership  face it youve had your feet in both worlds for a year  and never been able to bring them together  maybe someone else could  what as in maybe you as in yes  well maybe we should settle this right now  bring it brung  want some more of that huh yeah  you like that huh really guys really  hey hey how many fights do i have to break up this week  now calm

but you guys better be pulling out all the stops for regionals  because the number we just rehearsed is so offthehook  its dangerous  seriously people should wear  protective headgear when theyre watching it  guys were kidding  yeah well its just hard to laugh right now  with everything going on at mckinley  i mean look at us  the stars of two rival show choirs  sitting down to coffee our school is so messed up  we cant even keep our own football team together  its so sad you guys  coach beiste and mr shue were so close  to getting everyone at the school together  why hasnt finn told me anything about this  i mean we live together  mean i bring him a glass of warm milk every night  just in the hopes that well have a little ladychat  warm milk really  its delicious  finns too proud to complain  he feels like he has to be strong for everyone  but i know its just killing him inside  i hope he realizes  that you know if he and i were still together  i could make him feel a lot better you know  let it go rachel  i  i just wish thathere was a way that we could help  thats all yeah  and the worst part is how bummed the guys are  i mean they already suffer  enough abuse just being in glee  i really think winning the game could have eased  some of the pressure at least for a little while  wait so the whole team quit  everybody not in glee  i mean you cant play football with five guys  and one of them is in a wheelchair  yeah coach beiste put up a signup sheet  for people to join i think theyll take  anyone at this point  well the good news is  you actually only need four more guys  high school regulations actually let you  play a couple guys short if you want to  but if they figure out a way to make it work  you can bet that well definitely be there  to cheer them on totally  blaine and i love football  well blaine loves football i love scarves  i cut 30 guys when we had tryouts  at the beginning of the season  youre telling me not one of those guys wants to play  its like crossing a picket line  nobody wants to be a scab  i guess we should go break it to them  why cant we just let them  back on the team just for this game  no we carry this thing through  even if it means having to forfeit the game  i cant believe this is it  maybe it isnt  we want to join the team  we who  all us glee girls  we want to join the football team  and we want to play in the championship  come on guys stop screwing around  its not cool  whats not cool is you guys  not respecting women enough to realize  were perfectly capable of playing football  and dont forget who the state champ  in grecoroman wrestling is  ive got offers from three different  professional wrestling organizations  for after i graduate so  rachel have you actually seen a tackle football game  when they tackle you it hurts  yeah and not in the good mellencamp way  we thought about that but the truth is  is that you guys dont really need us to play  you just need enough players  out there to field a regulation team  so when they snap the ball  were just going to lie down on the ground  were just going to lie there  well im not  im going to bring the pain  i guess they wont get hurt if you stay down  okay what do your parents have to say about this  we all have signed permission slips from them  it took some convincing but they understood  what it means to all of us  what do you think coach  i think  welcome to the football team  yes  football team football team  high five teammate  i just dont want to die  you dont climb in that cannon  and that routine will be all boom boom and no pow   and that brittany is so 2000 and late  heres your consent form  and as you ponder your decision  i ask that you remember that that cannon  has two little baby twin cannons at home  and one more on the way  and if you refuse to sign this  well those little baby cannons might just go hungry  baby cannons  and the mama cannon has fibromyalgia  so she cant work  do you want us to win or dont you  how many ms are there in the letter r  make an x  its not too late  to commit social suicide  how the hell you going to play with five guys huh  you have got to be

following losers  the economy  mel gibson  the housing market  dina lohan wall street  tiger woods the dallas cowboys  brett favres cell phone  nine percent unemployment  and sparky lohan  who is dina lohans dog and apparently also a loser  how do you cope with that  ive been drinking a lot of bleach  do you regret the choice  of attempting to fire a student out of a cannon  other than attracting headlines  and launching a national debate on the safety of athletes  was it really worth it  honestly i was just trying to feel something  and how do you feel now that the remainder  of the annual cheerios budget  is going to the glee club  im sorry lets take a look  whoops sorry  couric after a little song and dance  toupport the arts  i sat down with mckinley glee club director  will
