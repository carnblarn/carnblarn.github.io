                1 the celibacy club will now come to order  lets start the meeting by reading the minutes  from last weeks meeting where we read the minutes  from the previous meeting  and rachel spent the hour quizzing quinn about the nature  of her relationship with finn  questions somebody still refuses to answer  and i will continue to refuse to answer them  because they are none of your business  all i will reveal  is that i rejoined the celibacy club to focus on me  me too finn is kryptonite which is  why i am focusing all my energies now on my songwriting  yes and i have to say i am very inspired  that both of you are showing how celibacy is a viable option  for teens who simply arent ready for intimacy  and for those who are older  and are terrified of the hose monster  i have a little bit of club swag here  that i thinks really gonna catch on ready  chastity charms  we hand out the little hearts but not the key  that way nobody can open the lock forever  and ladies thats what keeps us safe  i have some questions  some things that i im curious about  no no no why be curious  no wait to have relations until youre comfortable right  maybe till your honeymoon i dont know  maybe even later  celibacy ladies dig it  corrected by icephoenix  school bell rings im just so disappointed  why i thought you wanted the chastity charms to catch on  i did until i realized they were wearing the chastity charms  as clipon nipple rings  i know preaching abstinence is hard  but ive seen how a teen pregnancy  can turn a kids world upside down  so keep fighting the good fight  and im happy to do whatever i can to help make celibacy  an option for these kids  i dont know hot stuff  sounds pretty lame  holly what are you doing here  subbing the health and wellness teachers out  with a mad case of the herp yikers   oh its so good to see you  you too  oh this face this face  clears throat  oh oh this is  emma   emma emma pillsbury  oh hi   nice to meet you  very nice to meet you   this is holly holliday  hi holly  have a seat here   oh thank you  wow  so im curious why you dont uh think  that celibacy is a valid choice for teenagers  oh i do i think its a valid choice  i just dont think its that realistic  you know its like saying  vegetarianism is an option for lions  laughs  i just read in the newspaper that ninety high school girls in  a memphis school district got pregnant within three months  i mean it is tennessee but still  weve got to shake things up you know  information is power oh and by the way will  some of your glee kids are the most clueless  demonstration this is a condom  which can help prevent the spread of hiv  which can lead to aids  and it also prevents pregnancy  wait cucumbers can give you aids  seriously cause i just had them on my salad   weve got to educate these kids  i strongly disagree  i dont think that we should barrage these kids  with graphic information theyre kids  i dont want to steal their innocence  are you like some kind of crazy pope lady  think about the images that these kids are exposed to  i mean think about what they have access to  that doesnt make it okay  and it shouldnt change the message  that they get from us which is this is serious stuff  and its not for kids and its not for adults  okay well i think thats a little naive  now if youll excuse me im off to have crazy sex  because im crazy informed about it  kidding  will and holly laugh   hasta luego  hasta luego  oh man school bell rings  hey brittbritt so listen  how about you and i pop in some sweet valley high this evening  get our cuddle on  look id really like to get my sweet ladykisses on  but i havent been feeling very sexy lately  i think i have a bun in the oven  please dont tell anyone

your dating life  um right now im the president of the celibacy club  mmm  thats a waste of some fine manbutt  sexy  i really hope thats not one  of the requirements for regionals  because with berry in those tights   we dont stand a chance  no this isnt  about regionals im less worried  about that right now and more worried  about the fact that its become clear to me  that some of you have been lacking  when it comes to understanding the  the uh  the intricacies of adult relationships  sparse laughter yeah anyways  along with preparing for our regional next week  i want to spend the week educating ourselves  about some of these intricacies  is this the appropriate forum for that  will look whenever we had uh  issues in the past that are on our minds  or giving us problems  its always

of fellowship  as you no doubt have heard ive taken over  for the coach of aural intensity  we heard you pushed him down the stairs  no you cant prove that  this is just sort of how she talks  so i happen to have some top secret intel  will schuester has finally realized  that his teams achilles heel  is their utter lack of sex appeal  the new directions are getting sexy  and the key to regionals is outsexing them  and i suspect  that the judges are scoring extra for it this year  so porcelain  quid pro quo  what do you have for me  im sorry coach but you and are not in cahoots  probably should have nailed that down  before i gave you my top secret intel  porcelain  you just made a powerful enema  we got to hold an emergency meeting   why  werent you listening  the judges at regionals have an eye out  for something new which means  the warblers got to do something sexyfied  bell ringing  i am very disappointed in you will  letting holly come in and just  teach the glee

kept making  those weird faces the whole song  those werent weird faces  those were my sexy faces  it just looked like you were having gas pains  or something  great how are we supposed to get up on the stage at regionals  and sell sexy to the judges when i have as much sexual appeal  and knowledge as a baby penguin  well figure something out  i want to talk to you about something  i really like when we make out and stuff  which isnt cheating because   the plumbings different  mmhmm  but when artie and i are together  we talk about stuff like feelings  why  because with feelings its better  are you kidding  its better when it doesnt involve feelings  i think its better when it doesnt involve eye contact  i dont know i guess i just dont know how i feel about us  look  lets be clear here  im not interested in any labels  unless its on something i shoplift  i dont know santana  i think we should talk to somebody  like an adult  this relationship is really confusing for me  breakfast is confusing for you  well sometimes its sweet and sometimes its salty  like what if i have eggs for dinner then what is it  school bell rings  those linens are incredible  i know is that egyptian cotton  why do they keep editing all this vacation and plane stuff  it classes it up  if i want to see kim kardashian being classy ill watch e  laughs touch me  were not putting any of that stuff in ours   well maybe  hey guys whats going on   oh hey miss h hey can you help us out  uh yeah  lauren and i are gonna make a sex tape  so i can get a recording contract  wow okay  well first can i just say  that im very impressed by not only your ambition  but by how comfortable you are with your own bodies  easy to be comfortable when you look this good   you know what i mean  agreed  uh now for the downside  are you aware that because youre under eighteen years of age  making and owning a sex tape could make you guilty  of child pornography  listen guys dont take this too hard all right  these things just they never work out well  my sex tape with jd salinger was a disaster   thanks miss h  later dudes  ladies  miss holiday we need your help  bell ringing  so why are we sitting on the floor  cause were in japan  no  welcome to my sacred sexy sharing circle  i want to thank you guys for confiding in me  cause i know this is tough  and i want to ask both of you  if either one of you thinks that you might be a lesbian  i dont know  yeah i mean who knows  im attracted to girls and im attracted to guys  ive made out with a mannequin  i even had a sex dream about a shrub  that was just in the shape of a person  hmm well weve all been there  i went to an allgirls college  where the only industry in the town  was the manufacturing of softball equipment  i still feel a little tingle when i hear ani difranco  shudders ooh  anyway its not about  who you are attracted to ultimately  its about who you fall in love with  well i dont know how i feel  because santana refuses to talk about it  okay well i know talking about feelings can be really hard  so i have an idea  why dont you guys find a song  and see if maybe the lyrics of the song could help you  start a dialogue going  i could be down with that  i have the perfect song  theres just one problem though  brit and i may need your help to sing it  i thought youd never ask  bell ringing  all right so give me sensual  but dont make fun of it like really try  okay now give me sultry  um kurt theyre all sort of looking the same  thats because the face im actually doing is uncomfortable  this is pointless blaine  i dont know how to be sexy  because i dont know the first thing about sex  kurt youre blushing  ive tried watching those movies  but i just get horribly depressed  and i think about how they were all kids once  and they all have mothers  and god what would their mothers think  and why would you get that tattoo there  then maybe we should have a conversation about it  ill tell you what i know  i dont i dont want to know the graphic details  i like romance  thats why i like broadway musicals  because the touch of the fingertips  is as sexy as it gets  kurt youre going to have to learn about it someday  well not today  i think ive learned quite enough for today thank you  i think you should leave  school bell rings  so just nice and easy i dont want  to go too far away from the original version  since when do you need help  singing in front of the glee club  oh its not about the singing  im trying to make princes kiss into a tango  just want to make sure its appropriate  kiss as a tango  thats awesome and ridiculous  anyway i want to do this right for the sexy lesson  so picture us  in the auditorium big backdrop  lighting costume the whole thing  hit it  sexy by prince begins  uh   you dont have to be beautiful   to turn me on   i just need your body baby   from dusk till dawn   you dont need experience   to turn me out   you just leave it all up to me   im gonna show you what its all about   you dont have to be rich   to be my girl   you dont have to be cool   to rule my world   aint no particular sign   im more compatible with   i just want your extra time   and your kiss   yeah   women not girls rule my world   i said they rule my world   act your age not your shoe size   not your shoe size   maybe we can do the twirl   you dont have to watch dynasty   to have an attitude   you just leave it all up to me   my love will be your food   yeah   you dont have to be rich   to be my girl   dont have to be cool to rule my world   aint no particular sign   im more compatible with   i just want your extra time   and your   kiss   i am so into you   dont be  go out with me  oh you dont want any of this  im damaged goods  yes it makes me terrific in bed  but it also means i tend to break nice guys like you  into wasa crackers  oh i think i can handle it  you married your high school sweetheart  and then you went out with a virgin  its a great song  you dont need me though the kids are going to love it  bell ringing  need a hand  yeah why dont you hand me that carburetor  howd you know which one it was  my dad and i rebuilt a 59 chevy  in our driveway two summers ago  one of his many attempts at bonding   you here looking for parts  no actually  i uh wanted to talk to you about kurt  is he okay  have you ever talked to him about sex  are you gay or straight or what   im definitely gay  okay good  i mean you know whatever but uh  you know good for kurt  he needs someone like you to talk to  well thats kind of my point  ive tried talking to him  but he basically puts his fingers in his ears  and starts singing  well when hes ready hell listen  im worried that it might be too late  you know dalton doesnt even have sex ed classes  most schools dont and the ones that do  almost never discuss what sex is like for gay kids  kurt is is the most moral  compassionate person ive ever met  you know he gets that from his mother  and and i am blown away by your guys relationship  you think my dad built a car with me because he loves cars  i think he did it  because he thought getting my hands dirty  might make me straight  you know did he talk to you about this uh kind of stuff  no i had to go find it for myself  the internet is great and all the information is out there  but i went searching for it  kurt wont  and one day hell be at a party  and maybe have a few drinks  and then hell meet some guy and start fooling around  and hes not going to know about using protection  or stds  i dont have the relationship  with my dad that you have with kurt  i think it would be really cool if you took advantage of that  im sorry if im overstepping  you are  stevie nicks landslide begins  i took my love and i took it down   i climbed a mountain and i turned around   and i saw my reflection   in the snowcovered hills   well the landslide brought me down   oh mirror in the sky what is love   can the child within my heart rise above   can i sail through the changing ocean tides   can i handle the seasons of my life   oh oh  oh oh   oh oh  oh oh   oh oh oh oh   well ive been afraid of changing   cause i built my life around you   but time makes you bolder   children get older   and im getting older too   well im getting older too   so take this love   and take it down   yeah and if you climb a mountain and you turn around   and if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills   well the landslide brought me down   and if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills   well maybe   well maybe   the landslide will bring you down   applause   is that really how you feel  uh yeah  santana thank you  pretty cool that our girlfriends are such good friends right  i wish you and i were that close  can i just applaud this trio  for exploring the uncharted world of sapphic charm  brava brava  look just because i sang a song with brittany  doesnt mean that you can put a label on me  is that clear  school bell rings  this meeting of the celibacy club will now come to order  before we begin i would just like to start  by congratulating you by reminding you  not one member of this club  has had an unwanted pregnancy in almost a year  you get tenses for menses  id also like to welcome our newest member  noah puckerman   are you lost noah  yeah you dont belong here  youre the biggest french whore of them all  zizes and i were going to make a sex tape  i found out that  making that tape would have resulted in my arrest  ive hit rock bottom  and ive come here to set myself straight  thats just awesome noah  and youre just in time because tomorrow  the girls and i are going to perform a song for glee club  extolling the benefits of celibacy  im down for that  point of order though  while three chicks and me is just a typical saturday night  in the puckerman bedroom  its not the best balance for singing  we need at least one more dude  ive got that covered  starland vocal bands afternoon delight begins  gonna find my baby   gonna hold her tight   gonna grab some afternoon delight   my mottos always been when its right its right   why wait until the middle of a cold dark night   when everythings a little clearer in the light of day   and we know the night is always gonna be here anyway   thinking of yous working up an appetite   looking forward to a little afternoon delight   rubbin sticks and stones together   makes the sparks ignite   and the thought of lovin you is getting so excitin   skyrockets in flight   afternoon delight   ah   afternoon delight   sparse applause  sighs   hi um holly here  yeah  so im a little confused  isnt this a strange song for the the celibacy club to sing  chuckles but why  its so wholesome  it was written during the bicentennial  to celebrate america and fireworks  no its about sneaking out for a nooner  yes exactly  a nooners when you have dessert in the middle  of the day right  right carl  will well regardless  it was a great job guys great number  holly it was it was fantastic  will hey glee club lets go  miss holliday excuse me a second  miss holliday  youre still the um  youre still the acting sexed teacher right  you know it brother  uh you dont happen to have any office hours do you   sure  emma afternoon delight is a dessert  its made with coconut and pineapple  and marshmallow fluff  i think emma and i need an appointment  what are those  those are some pamphlets that i picked up from the free clinic  i thought it might help the process along  because it is time you and i had the talk   no its not  yes it is   you told me to educate myself  la la la   la la la  hey you think this is easy for me   la la la la  okay believe me  i want to do this even less than you do  this is going to suck for both of us  but we are going to get through it together  and we will both be better men because of it  now first most of the um  mechanics of what youre going  to be doing is covered in the pamphlets  okay so i want you to read them and then i want you to come talk  to me about it  deal  okay  all right now hey sit down  were just getting started  all right  you know for most guys sex is just you know  its this thing we always want to do  you know its fun  it feels great  but were not really thinking too much about you know  how it makes us feel on the inside or you know  how the other person feels about it  women are different  only because they get that its about something more  than just the physical  you know when when youre intimate with somebody  in that way youre exposing yourself  you know youre never going to be more vulnerable  and that scares the hell out of a lot of guys  believe me i cant tell you how many buddies ive got  who have gotten in way too deep with a girl  who said she was cool with just hooking up  but thats not going to happen to me dad  no its going to be worse  okay because its two guys  with two guys  youve got two people who think that sex is just sex  its gonna be easier to come by  and once you start doing this stuff  youre not going to want to stop  you just youve got to know that it means something  you know its doing something to you  to your heart to your selfesteem  even though it feels like youre just having fun  so youre saying i shouldnt have sex  i think on your thirtieth birthday it is a great gift to yourself  kurt  when youre ready  i want you to be able to  do everything  but when youre ready i want you  to use it as a way to connect to another person  dont throw yourself around  like you dont matter  cause you matter kurt  is that it  thats it for now  can i make you some toast  i think ill take it up to my room  to eat while i look over my new pamphlets   thank you dad  youre welcome  sighs  now i hear you guys are having some problems   i wouldnt call them problems  no we are  we really really are were having problems  when is the last time that you   never  i beg your pardon  weve been married four months  and we still havent done the deed  girlfriend what is up with that  hes hot  youre thirty  i havent felt comfortable   so  well what is it that you do  um okay  so we cuddle a lot   a lot  a lot   we cuddle too much  oh well no   were were cuddle monsters  okay okay  we we watch the housewives shows  which are so so racy racy  its not like i havent tried i try  ive made her romantic dinners  i give her roses  and every time i try to touch her  laughing that happens  im so sorry  okay look i am not a doctor okay  i dont even like doctor tv shows  unless its one of those ones where people strap bombs  to their chest love those  so i would like to ask you a question  and i want you to answer it very seriously  are you still in love with will schuester  you know i was sort of thinking the same thing  but i was afraid to ask it   um  are you  i feel very confused about my feelings   okay  im sorry  no you and your feelings can stay at the condo  and ill be at the radisson  thank you doctor  not a doctor  could you please please not tell will about this   no of course not of course not  okay   my lips are sealed  okay thank you  just like your legs  oh ha kidding  god that was rude  why did i

in glee club  yeah  cause its made me do a lot of thinking  what ive realized is why im such a bitch all the time  im a bitch because im angry  im angry because i have all of these feelings  feelings for you that im afraid of dealing with  because im afraid of dealing with the consequences  and brittany  i cant go to an indigo girls concert i just cant  i understand that  do you understand what im trying to say here  not really  i want to be with you  but im afraid of the talks and the looks  i mean you know what happened to kurt at this school  but honey if anybody were to ever make fun of you  you would either kick their ass  or slash them with your vicious vicious words  sniffles yeah i know but  im so afraid of what everyone will say behind my back  still i have to accept  that i love you  i love you  and i dont want to be with sam or finn  or any of those other guys  i just want you  please say you love me back   please  of course i love you i do  and i would totally be with you  if it werent for artie  artie  i love him too  i dont want to hurt him thats not right  i cant break up with him  yes you can hes just a stupid boy  but it wouldnt be right  santana you have to know  if artie and i were to ever break up  and im lucky enough that youre still single  dont  i am so yours  proudly so  yeah wow  whoever thought that being fluid meant you could be so stuck  im sorry

wheres ms pillsbury  she decided to take the hour she was spending here  to use it to fix her sham of a marriage  in the interim ill be taking over  because you annoyingly take over everything  because i realized that  while all of us making our celibacy pledge is wonderful  one day were going to fall in love with someone  and were going to choose to be intimate with them  speaking of being intimate whats with the hickey quinn  its not a hickey  oh i know hickeys im a freakin connoisseur  i can make them into shapes like balloon animals  i burnt myself this morning with a curling iron  the key is to use the curling iron in the bathtub  to keep you from getting burnt  no  quinn i was sure i was caught  car horn honks  what was that  is that your mom  shes at work she wont be home for hours  divorce rules  come here  ooh  ill be more careful with the hickey placement next time  this is so awesome  we have two months until prom so we have plenty of time  to campaign for prom king and queen  but thats not all this is about though right  look i made a mistake with puck  you should have been my first  this is where i belong   with you okay  okay  school bell ringing  hey hot

um just came to say goodbye  im going over to shawnee township to teach algebra  really  yeah there were some parent complaints  apparently my cucumber demonstration  made it impossible to watch veggietales  the same way ever again  i personally thought it made watching that show hilarious  uh wow i  i really dont want to say goodbye  then maybe we shouldnt  teaching santana and brittany how to get their stevie nicks on  made me realize how closed off ive been  im getting older too maybe i should try  a relationship that lasts more than thirtysix hours  youre serious  plus seeing another woman with the hots for you  kinda made me jealous   wait what  oh nothing  i know a lot about sex will but  maybe its time i learned a little something about romance  well i dont know if youve heard  but i happen to be an excellent educator  corrected by icephoenix
