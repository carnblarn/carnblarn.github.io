hurt  quinns preggo and feels like shes totally alone  and sue wont leave will alone as the poor guys trying  to get over divorcing his terrible wife terri  i mean shes not terrible  shes just kind of you know terrible  sorry and thats what you missed on glee  bell ringing  mercedes is it just me or does it feel like  we have a real shot at regionals next month  the ohio show choir chat rooms have all been buzzing  about how vocal adrenaline has lost a step  i agree the judges know all of their tricks  and now that we have jessie  theyve lost their best performer  you guys have to come to the auditorium its an emergency  bell ringing  jessie  what are you doing up there with them  ive transferred back to carmel high rachel  im sorry that its come to this  but you guys were awful to me  you never accepted me  you never listened to my clearly superior ideas  why are you here in our auditorium  the blogs and the chat rooms say that were finished  and that you guys are ripe to topple us  we just wanted to show you  a something we came up with a few days ago  to see if you agree with that assessment  bass line to another one bites the dust playing   bombombom   ooh lets go   steve walks warily down the street    with the brim pulled way down low    aint no sound but the sound of his feet    machine guns ready to go    are you ready   hey    are you ready for this    are you hanging on the edge of your seat    out of the doorway the bullets rip    to the sound of the beat   yeah    bombombom    another one bites the dust    bombombom    another one bites the dust    how do you think im gonna get along    without you when youre gone    you took me for everything that i had    and kicked me out on my own    are you happy    are you satisfied    how long can you stand the heat    out of the doorway the bullets rip    to the sound of the beat look out    bombombom    another one bites the dust   song ends  thanks for letting us borrow your auditorium guys  its quaint  laughing  sighs  bell ringing  artie its a carmel high tradition  they psych out the competition a few weeks before the big show  they call it a funkification  meaning they show us what theyve got  and we spiral into a deep black funk  yeah yeah we used to do the same thing  to other football teams  you know try and get inside their head before a big game  pull little pranks to intimidate them  yeah well the difference was our football team sucked  those guys are golden  kurt come on keep your heads up guys  its going to take more than that  to get us into a funk   tina i feel so violated  its like someone broke into our home  look it was just a lame little prank  and the fact that theyre trying to get to us  means maybe we got them spooked  uhuh mr shue they arent afraid of anything  that number they did was fantastic  you know which doesnt make any sense  they had all that equipment  how did they even get in  i gave em all keys  helped them do a sound check  over the weekend  hey this way fellas  lets punch out this wall here  thatll open up the space a little bit sue what are you doing  i cant talk to you now william  drafting class is helping me redecorate around here  you see i have nationals over the weekend  and i expect to return with a comically large  first place trophy for which  i have absolutely no room in my trophy case  as soon as you hurry up and lose at regionals  this choir room will become my official trophy annex  you know what it has to look like  elvis gold record room at graceland  except ill be wanting far fewer morbidly obese  white women waddling around and crying  sue get out of my room  glee clubbers for you those of you whose hearing  has not been damaged by massive doses of acutane listen up  in a few weeks glee club will be finished  now how do i know that  well i recently checked the odds with my vegas bookie  who told me that youre 401 underdogs at regionals  you are going to lose and your dreams  will be crushed  sue can i see your trophy  sure will  hope and dream  you dropped your trophy sue  you know for me trophies are like herpes  you can try to get rid of them but they just keep coming  you know why  sue sylvester has hourly flareups of burning itchy  highly contagious talent  enjoy your last few days here  this room is mine  bell ringing  so you sign here  and here  and you sign here and here  pens clicking  pens scribbling  clearing throat  well  by the power vested in me by the bar association  of the great state of ohio  i know pronounce you no longer husband and wife  mazel tov  door closing  youre still that  you always will be  door closing  bell ringing  all right guys today i want to talk to you about regrets  who has some  giving my heart to jessie just to have it crushed  like the stage floor at a performance of stomp  thinking trust me was a sensible birth control option  we all have them  i just finalized my divorce  i regret living in a relationship  that wasnt working  letting her put me in these deep funks  and not fighting back  besides creeping us out why are you telling us this  because if we lose to vocal adrenaline at regionals  none of us are going to regret it  we will have given it our best shot  and we wont look back  but we will regret letting them get the best of us  before the competition  which is why we need to hit them back just like they hit us  so you want us to tp their choir room  whatever the better cooler version of that is  like uh maybemaybe we should steal their school statue  their school statue  is a giant bronze of a great white shark eating a seal pup  it weighs three tons  okay how about this one  all right we get like  puck everyone knows this is going to come down to me  revenge fear the merciless infliction of pain  these are my kingdoms  first time i gave a wedgie to a kid i was four years old  finn and i may still hate each other for some reason  but we both know that defending the honor of new directions  is going to be our dirty job  dog barking in distance  hissing  yeah i did it  and im proud all i did was step up and be a man  they got what was coming to them  a few of my students tpd your choir room  you slashed the tires on the range rovers  of all 26 of my performers  those were gifts for our win at sectionals  thats 200 times 26  times four equals  i dont have a calculator  im sorry you bought all your kids range rovers  we have a very active booster club  look nobody got hurt  it was a harmless prank  sue thats what they said about a young man in chicago  in 1871 who thought hed play a harmless prank  on the dairy cow of one mrs oleary  he successfully ignited its flatulence  and a city burned william  that young terrorist went on to become  the first gay president of the united states  abraham lincoln enough  these students have committed a felony  they are hereby expelled  look i dont want anyone to get expelled  im not going to press charges  as long as you pay for the damage  you can take it out of the glee club budget  thatll bankrupt the glee club  we dont have that kind of money  well get jobs  give us a month  well pay you back  ms corcoran i promise  fine  ms corcoran you are as wise and magnanimous  as you are beautiful  thank you  well you just cant win can you william  you never have and you never will  are you want to take a trip down that rabbit hole william  im willing to try anything sandy  im just really depressed  i dont sell to the clinically depressed  youll throw yourself off a parking garage  and i cant have that on my conscience  i used to coach that glee club  i know what youre up against  you think carmel high didnt put the fear of god in me  i dont know how we can possibly beat them  glee is hanging by a thread  william the answer is right in front of your face  but you cant see it because youre in  too big of a funk  vocal adrenaline has a weakness  bell ringing  funk  use it in a sentence  come on  rachel  this cheese smells funky  thats because its fromunda cheese  shut it puckerman  okay okay  i was thinking more along the lines of  vocal adrenaline has sure put us all in a funk  im so depressed ive worn the same outfit twice this week  what if i told you  i knew how we could shove it right back down their throats  new directions is about  to make their funk the pfunk  we are going to get funked up  the only way to do that is to beat them at regionals  vocal adrenaline has never once done a funk number  theyre a machine a collective synthesized  soulless beat  funk is soul meets anger  its passion is in its emotion  and vocal adrenaline doesnt perform with any  so you have your assignment  i want you guys to turn mckinley high into   funky town   you guys can relax i got this one covered  cool  hold on a second  ii want a chance to get funky too  laughter  laughing good one quinn  it even sounds funny when you say it  you said funk was about soul and anger  i have plenty of both  look at me look at my life  im furious  mercedes lets be honest  when white people try to be funky  you end up with kc and the sunshine band  i love boogie shoes  mercedes racism aside  i will have something prepared tomorrow  all right quinn goes first  bell ringing  rachel can i see you in my office  you seem to be taking this jessie thing pretty hard  i want him to be eaten by a lion  sighs jessie cared about you  no he didnt  our entire relationship was just some diabolical plan  they knew if they broke my heart  close enough to the competition  that id lose my will to live  and then new directions would have no chance  at winning regionals  its textbook you destroy the heart  of the teams heart and you destroy the team  will sandy told me how to beat vocal adrenaline  and now rachel was inadvertently telling me  how to beat my other nemesis  suddenly i wasnt feeling nearly as depressed  playing tentative melody  william im gonna have to ask you to clear out  i received an anonymous tip from someone  who wants to meet me here  to discuss an illegal hot cheetos ring  hot cheetos have been proven  to raise endorphins which makes for happy kids  and i cant have that  yeah no worries sue  ill just find someplace else to  oh wow  what  itits nothing  its just its just the way the light hit you  just now you looked stunning  no youre radiant  well the week before nationals every year  i have
