                1 pucks got a thing  for lauren zizes but shes not really down with it  i dont think youre ready for this jelly  finn kissed quinn whos supposed to be dating sam  and rachel kissed finn too but he didnt feel the fireworks  on the cheek can you believe that  sue tried to shoot brittany out of a cannon to win nationals  but the only thing she won  was katie courics loser of the year  i hate you diane sawyer  and thats what you missed on glee  i actually learned something  in my spanish class today  regresar  who knows what that means  to come back  thats right i realized the old will schuster was back  glee clubs going to regionals  we got all of sues cheerios money  im past terry im over emma  to come back now if were going  to put it in the past will  its an emergency  becky jackson opened sues journal and found this  goodbye cruel world  she could be dead by now   its weird the doors open  sue sue  no all right  sue  oh my lord oh  oh sue sue  wake up sue sue wake up  i dont feel a pulse she doesnt have a pulse  yeah i do  i just stopped my own heart  thats my cia training  these gummi vitamins didnt work at all  i was told you take enough vitamin a  and you drift off  into a blissful oblivion  instead my face just got really hot  and my jaw is sore from all that chewing  i have nothing to live for  thats not untrue  emma we didnt come here to give her a pep talk  im sorry sue but you brought this on yourself  i am well aware of my situation will  after my humiliating failure  to qualify for nationals  there is nothing for me or my cheerios  to do for the rest of the year  why dont you do what other cheer squads do  namely cheer for the teams at the school  yeah like thats going to happen  emma lets go  sue you are nasty manipulative and petty  will you have more grease in your hair  than the guy behind wikileaks  oh i for one am not going to play backup  at your little pity party  take it easy sue  hey hi  so i wanted to confirm our date on friday at color me mine  wait you were serious about that  its painting coasters time  so we good for friday  yeah i think so  i mean i dont think i have anything else to do  cool  things have been weird  since quinn got mono a couple of weeks ago  everyone keeps telling me that she must have kissed finn  but i believe it when she told me what really happened  i didnt kiss finn sam  i saved his life  hes not breathing  i totally almost choked on a gumball once  i know shes into me  i just get the feeling that im losing her  i cant let that happen  quinns the best thing thats happened to me  since i got to this school  but how  of course my dad always said  there are two ways to get a woman to love you  take her hunting and rock n roll  i knew what i had to do  i mean whos more rock and roll than justin bieber  no one thats who  the hair was step one  step two was booking  a couple of bat mitvah gigs  to test out how my new one man band would go over  hey  im the justin bieber experience  dbaby baby baby oh d  dlike d  dbaby baby baby d  dno d  dlike baby baby baby d  doh d  i thought youd   dalways be mine d  heads up quinn fabray youre about to be  hit head on with the full blond bieber  hey brittany we need to talk  why are my leg warmers on your arms  i got cold  but no we had a deal okay  as i explained i am in the midst  of a career resurgence okay  i am done with boys and i am concentrating fully  on my career now  the only way to make a complete comeback  is to dominate popular discussion  maybe launch a trend or two  i have you half of my allowance  so you could take a signature look of mine  and make it popular  and we decided tha legwarmers were more likely  to catch on than reindeer sweaters  yes precisely but it wont work  if you insist on wearing them incorrectly  i didnt realize that there were rules  of course there are rules theyre legwarmers  well can i wear them that way tomorrow  i wore a tank top today because i thought it was summer  no one ever taught me how to read a calendar  fine fine and when people ask you  who gave you the inspiration for your new accessory  youre going to say im just copying rachel  im just copying rachel berry  fantastic  you know how i feel about hats  just cause  none of you should be making eye contact with me  get out go  get used to this abuse glee kids  i got nothing but time  nothing but time  i think shes dangerous  idle hands are the devils playthings  i mean sues got nothing to do now  which means its only a matter of time  before she starts coming after the glee club  hey will esm  so sorry for not being sorry for interrupting  but would you mind  if i borrowed one of your rafters  so i could hang myself  i just did a test run back in my office  and you know what theres asbestos up there  and that can kill a person  sue sit  now i understand youre upset  but life is beautiful  are you going to tell me there hasnt been  one moment since your epic decline  that you havent felt yourself  feel good about something  well yes will  as a matter of fact there was  there was one moment  i was driving to work this morning in my lecar  and charlenes ive never been to me came on the radio  and when it got to the chorus  i just opened my mouth and belted it out with her  and i have to say it felt really good  sue should join the glee club  im sorry  no id rather be dead  yes she should join i mean you cant join  but she can sit in  yes will  look sue is in a really bad place right now  and youre always talking about the healing power of music  there are studies that show it helps with depression  it elevates mood  i have a pamphlet  uh emma i dont think this is a good idea at all  i agree with spongehair squarechin  its a stupid idea  no no the football team did it for a spell  and that really brought people together  will and this is a great chance  for you to keep your eye on sue  you know make sure the old gals okay  well you know what folks at this point  to alleviate my crippling depression  id do anything  this cannot be happening  this seems like a terrible idea  guys its not up for discussion okay  now its no secret that coach sylvester has taken her licks  i mean just wanky  and i believe she could use a little sympathy from us  sympathy from us uhuh  yeah all shes ever done is make our lives miserable  she got exactly what she deserved  youre lucky i left my blowgun at home airbags  cause i got a clear shot at your nonnies  guys coach sylvester has had her recent setbacks  but she is a proven champion  now we could do worse  than to have that kindf a winning record in our midst  let me break it down for you  i am no longer a threat to you people  all right im just hoping that your singing and dancing around  will pull me out of my doldrums and give me  a reason to live is that too much to ask  guys its settled  sues going to be with us for the week  now i received an envelope in the mail today  we know that were facing kurt and the warblers at regionals  sweet porcelain  and it looks like this year  we face aural intensity again  they cleaned our clock last year  seems like the governing board  has assigned a theme to this years regionals  and part of our score will be based  upon how well we interpret it this years theme  anthem now who can tell us what an anthem is  the bottom of an ants pants  so close so close no  an anthem is an epic song  filled with a groundswell of emotion  that somehow seems bigger than itself  even bigger than the person performing it mr shue  oh hey sam i didnt even notice your new haircut  yeah ive been working on a new image to go  with my new oneman band the justin bieber experience  youve got to be kidding me  dude that haircut makes your mouth look even bigger  let her speak  look laugh all you want but that kids an epic talent  and theres a number ive been working on  that ive been wanting to show off  and i think it qualifies as an anthem  because its just hugely emotional  and sums up our generation  all right lets hear it buddy  doh whoa whoa d  doh whoa oh d  doh whoa whoa d  dyou know you love me i know you care d  djust shout whenever and ill be there d

so expand  i dont get it you guys were  totally making fun of me for singing bieber  thats because we underestimated the power of the biebes  hes clearly like a minigod  look how you made all those chicks melt  in glee club now think about  the power of four biebers  wed be unstoppable  all of our relationships are in the standard  postvalentines day lull  are you playing angry birds  sorry  want me to show you my abs  if you want to  heres what happens to the female chemistry  they get a huge shot of endorphins  on valentines day and everything is heightened  and so romantic the problem is  days later when they come down from their sees candy high  they crash and everything else  by comparison is humdrum  we need the sugary sweet jolt of the biebes  to get us some action again  why do you want in puckerman  im at the end of my lauren zises rope  ill try anything to get into those enormous pants  uh whats going on  were joining  the justin bieber experience  if sams cool with it  and if not were starting our own band  bieber fever  wait youyou guys do realize that  justin bieber sucks right  quinn seemed to be pretty into him when i was singing in glee club  right well im gonna spend my time  working on songs that arent geared toward 12yearolds  good and then you wont  have time to pick up any other guys girlfriends  hey back off man  i didnt kiss your girlfriend  she saved my life  so what do you say  are we in  fine but we need to figure out  something to do with puckermans hair  oh no  no way  youre a genius they have changed my life  i didnt know my arms could be so toasty  youre a hero you should win  some kind of award  what are you doing  im so sorry rachel it just sort of caught on  i see that okay that is not what we agreed upon  i want my allowance back right now  its already gone  my uncle lost his job  and his goat was going hungry so  i spent it on food for the goat  i mean sort of the goat just ate the money  okay thethe only way to proceed is for you to come  to school dressed exactly like me  what is that look called  sexy schoolgirl librarian chic  all right youd better get a move on okay  kids r us closes at  dear journal l my lust for life is renewed  i have found myself dropped behind enemy lines  poised to destroy the glee club from within  schuester and his guidance counselor ginger  fell for my pity party hook line and sinker  and now im in and ready to sink them  once and for all  thus begins my plan  i will pit these glee clubbers against one another  rupturing the group internally until it explodes  like a ripe zit  you wanted to see me  yes mercedes have a seat  so ive decided im going to sing a song in glee club  and i need your advice  now as you may know i have a background in music  for a brief period i was a tambourine player for wilsonphillips  what i need to learn from you  is how to be a diva  oh well youve definitely come to the right girl  i mean being a diva is all about attitude  something i know youre not short on  its all about sassy fingers and shaking that weave  and generally taking no nonsense from nobody  dig it sister  well i have to say  im flattered and shocked that you came to me  oh come now rachelle it doesnt humble me too much  to say i simply need your tutelage  well ill say this being a diva is all about emotion  in fact you feel so much emotion  that it cannot be physically contained  sometimes you have to close your eyes  and turn your head and push  push your feelings away theyre that big  wow  well that mercedes is wrong about you  what what did she say  oh i dont remember the specifics just something about  youre not as talented as you think you are  and all your ideas are horrible  i dont know something like that  she said what  yep quote  not that talented  there you are i heard what you said about me  i heard what you said about me  just when i thought we were friends  i guess that will just never happen will it  i guess not  you know theres only one i in diva rachel  and that i is me  guess were just gonna have to settle this the oldfashioned way  divaoff  tomorrow glee club why not right now  cause i have to go get my crosstrainers  want to know why  im gonna be doing some runs  so friday night  i figured wed check out the sullivan rink  they have ice rink bumper cars  i told you i havent decided what im doing yet  sweet jesus who bought tickets to crazy town  all right looks like  the guys here are ready to give us their anthem  everybody we are the new and improved  the justin bieber experience  and we think this song is an anthem  because everything bieber does is epic  truth  anyway this song  like all the songs i sing  is for my girlfriend quinn  hit it  gotta keep it feels so right   gotta gotta gotta gotta keep it close  oh   feel so right   doh for you id write a symphony d  did tell the violin d  dits time to sink or swim d  dwatch them play for you d  for you id be running  whoa whoa   da thousand miles d

think  honestly although my love would crush him  im totally turned on by the biebster  that is until i remember that he looks like hes 12  then its sort of creepy  so if i were gonna give cplus  listen zises  im dying here you got me  every which way and we both know im not the brightest  so please what do i have to do to get with you  i may have a proposition for you  ill keep you posted  color me mine  ill color you yours any day  mm sammy evans  you are biebalicious  how are things going with you and quinn  fine  no theyre not  you and i should uh talk soon  sams an artist finn an artist  i guess thats why hes taking you to color me mine  i told you i needed time to figure out  what i was gonna do with sam and i did  i choose him because of the justin bieber experience  look i thought it was gonna be stupid too  but he was so shameless  he just got up there and owned it  it was sexy  im sorry finn  but like i said sams an artist  and at the end of the day  it really turns me on  do dudes ever get erections when they wrestle with you  shut it puckerman were here to talk business  sorry  okay i want to do a number for glee club  its stage one of my master plan  shibby so what you want me to back you up on my ax  yeah but i also need some advice  im a little bit nervous about singing in front of a crowd  up until now ive only really sung in the steam shower  hot but ridiculous  i mean youre the most confident chick i know  yeah i know im hot melted butter  but singings different and i want to be great  or at least as good as barry  i get nervous before i sing too  but i always overcome  you want to know my secret  yeah  oldest trick in the book  just picture the audience in their underwear  even the dudes  its not about sex  its just about seeing the audience  as more vulnerable than you  trust me it works every time  can i touch your knockers now  only if you want to lose a hand  but youre on your way  remember i want this divaoff to be a bloodbath  oh trust its about to go down  you look amazing i really do  this look has to go viral  is there any way you can cut class for the rest of the day  just so that you could walk down the halls  totally most teachers think by cutting class  i might improve my grades  great  why are you dressed like that  i thought you werent into the biebster  well i wasnt but then somebody told me  that justin biebers like the king of youtube  with over a billion views  an anthem is supposed to appeal to the masses right  so before i pick my anthem  i was working on my anthem look  okay guys and gals and sue  its the moment weve all been waiting for  our next divaoff  so here they are sure to give us a fantastic anthem  mercedes and rachel  lets give it up  uh after much argument i finally convinced mercedes  that in order to do a proper divaoff  it has to come from the broadway catalogue  which i think is safe to say  that that gives me a home field advantage so  oh wellyoure about to get beat on your own turf  hit it  dyeah d  dyeah d  dooh d  devery single day i walk down the street d  di hear people say d  dbabys so sweet d  dever since puberty everybody stares at me d  dboys girls i

 despite the fact  that your mouthtoface ratio is like way off  you still somehow manage to be cute  but make no mistake  every time you open your humongous mouth  to do an impression or moisten  an enormous stamp for a lazy giant  you take one step closer to everyone seeing  that you are actually a dork  which is where i come in  i hereby offer my services as a mistress  i wants on them froggy lips  and i wants on em now  but im dating quinn  she cheated on you  no she didnt  look i know youre as dumb as a bag of wet hair  but you know in your heart shes lying  that gumball story was insane  youre choosing to believe it  so you can still be with her  but consider my offer  not only am i giving you full visitation rights  to the set of rambunctious twins that live on my ribcage  you get the chance to show  that pastry bag finn that  he cant mess with sam evans  and not just because you can unlock your humongous jaw  and swallow him whole like a python  but because you have some buzz

for wearing my boyfriends shirts  were not going to color me mine  and im not your boyfriend  wait why  because you cant look me in the eye right now  and tell me that you didnt make out with finn  i want to be with you sam  forget it okay  no harm no foul  oel ngati kameie  crap santana told me to stop speaking navi  since when is santana telling you what to do  since we started going out  di thought youd always be mine d  dour whole life d  when did that happen  all right i hate to say it  but i think we all owe sue  a big thankyou she may hate us  but she did give us a kickbutt song for regionals  yeah she did  thats right thats right  mr schuester i think that our admiration for coach sylvester  might just be a little premature  while i love my ehemical romance  and i think we all kicked butt  on that number as our team leader  and arbiter of all that is good i i have to say that  i dont think that that song is good enough for regionals  the warblers have kurt and blaine  as their like onetwo punch  and aural intensity kicked our butt last year  we cant just do any song to beat  either of those teams you mean  a number where you dont get to sing the entire song  guys this  isnt about me what do you suggest rachel  we need to need to be bold and epic  we need to write  our own original music for regionals  we need an undisputable advantage  check out dwarf diane warren  look we cant  lose regionals again this year you guys  okay you have to trust me  i feel really really strongly about this  lets put it to a vote okay rachel  all those in favor of doing an original song  chemical romance  hey there buddy  sue  you know i have to be honest we missed you in here today  oddly youre uh kind of a fun addition  oh well charles manson would have been  a fun addition to your pack of losers  well looks like youre back to your old self  ah hardly  im on my way to becoming  someone much better  and youve inspired me will  youve made me realize i have more to offer the world  than coming up with spectacular  lifethreatening cheerleading tumbles  i got the music in me  sue that is great  i mean with that attitude you are welcome in here anytime  oh i couldnt do that itd be spying on the competition  what  no one told you  i got a parttime gig  yeah im the new coach for aural intensity  thats impossible  oh nothings impossible will  when you have a positive attitude  you taught me that  isnt it great  geez i got my mojo back  still get to dedicate my life to destroying yours  lifes good  see you at regionals  you must be happy  why is that  quinn is back on the market  shell be easy pickings after what sam did to her  i dont want to talk about quinn  i want to talk about you  you were right in there today  about that number not being good enough to win  we need to write our own songs  why didnt you say that when i needed you  it wouldnt have made a difference  the only way to prove it to those guys  is to write a great song and shove it down their throats  well do you think that you and i should do it together  no i think you should do it yourself  lets face it youre the real trendsetter in there and  if someone was gonna write a song to win regionals it would be you  do you really believe in me that much  more  you know  i really like the rachel that i saw in there today  reminded me of the old you  focused and take no prisoners  i think she might be making a comeback
