                heres what you missed last week quinns pregnant  and pucks the father but everybody thinks its finn  youre a punk who doesnt deserve to have quinn  as his girlfriend  except for quinns parents  who dont know anything at all  they just know shes in the celibacy club  well call the vatican  we got ourselves another immaculate conception  and thats what you missed on    glee    school bell ringing  ballad  from middle english balade  who knows what this word means  its a male duck  kurt  a ballad is a love song  sometimes but they dont always express love  ballads are stories set to music  which is why theyre the perfect storm  of selfexpression  stories and music are the way we express feelings  that we cant get out any other way  okay now  sectionals are in a few weeks  and theres a new rule this year  we have to perform a ballad  looks like my weekly letter  to the ohio show choir committee  finally paid off  okay so heres our assignment for the week  im going to pair you off  and i want you to pick a ballad to sing to your partner  look them right in the eye  find the emotion you want to express  and make them feel it  i pick quinn  no no no  too easy  your partners will be chosen by fate  all ooh ooh yeah  i put all your names in this hat  whoever you choose is your partner  whispering i bet the ducks in the hat  santana but matts out sick today  he had

laughter  mr shue i dont know if i can do this with another guy  the fates have spoken finn  other asian  brittany  gasps  how fitting yay  no way  looks like i get you mr shue  uh you know what  maybe we should just wait until matt gets back  the fates talked mr shue  laughter  would you mind clarifying  what kinds of songs you want us to sing  why dont you let mr schuester and i demonstrate  brad endless love in bflat please  its my favorite duet  i really dont think  thats an appropriate song rachel  why its a great song  and its a perfect ballad  yeah i really like that song mr shue  laughter  endless love intro playing    my love    kurt i could totally sing this song with finn  but screw him if hes thinks  hes taking the diana ross part from me    the only thing thats right    puck i love the days when i dont wear underwear    my first love    finn i never noticed how nice rachels butt is  oh crap i think quinn knows im staring at it    youre every breath that i take      youre every step i make      and i      i      i want to share      all my love with you      no one else will do      and your eyes      your eyes your eyes      they tell me how much you care      oh yeah    rachel wow  ive never noticed this before  because hes always trying to destroy my career  but mr shue has really pretty eyes    my endless love    and really nice teeth  hes obviously invested in good oral hygiene  and thats important to me  it shows wonderful selfesteem    ill be that fool      for you      im sure    will i dont like the way  shes looking at me  oh i shouldnt have sung this song to her  crap she looks crazy right now  i know this look    yes      youll be the only one      oh      cause no      no one cant deny      this love i have inside      and ill

polyester cheerios uniform  the control panel hid my baby bump perfectly  thats odd  we had this custommade a month ago  i had a really big lunch today at school  really big tacos  no worries sweetie  ill just take it down to the tailor tomorrow  well let it out a little bit  the problem here  honey is you know  i just dont think youve been getting  enough exercise ever since you quit the cheerios  am i right yeah  yeah thats right  i mean you used to spend hours  every day doing backflips and high kicks  and now i mean now you spend all your free time  sitting on a stool in the dark singing show tunes  do you know how many calories you burn singing  hmm  not very many russell judy  glenn beck is on  gasps  oh wait hold on  hold on laughing hes so  oh i dont want to see  daddy its not

yet  no its just  you and me all week long  great  well ill see you at 400  is there something else  i just wanted to give you this  open it  gold stars are kind of my signature thing  i figure every time you wear it you can think of me  and the star youre helping me become  will its happening  again  it always starts with a novelty gift  i mean you cant blame her will  i mean if we were going to rank crushworthy teachers  at this school youd be number one with a bullet  uh well i  when did when did this start with rachel  we sang a duet in glee club endless love  okay in hindsight that was probably a mistake  yeah  i cant handle going through this again  sorry going through um going through what again  have i ever told you about  suzy pepper  so the alpacas start there  and uh travel down towards guatemala  suzy pepper wasnt the first schoolgirl crush  but she was the hardest  it happened about two years ago  before you were a teacher here  suzy was unique  mr shue how do you conjugate the verb  to love  peppers  so you can wear them and think of me  suzy pepper  i thought it would burn out like the others  but it only got worse  phone ringing groans  hello  heavy breathing  who is it who died  heavy breathing continues  suzy pepper  you knew it was me just by the sound of my breath  thats so romantic  listen you little psycho this is wills wife  and if i dont get enough sleep my antidepressants wont work  and then ill go crazy and ill kill you  terri stop calling  sighs  cant you handle anything will  terri was right school bell ringing  or so i thought  i decided to be honest with suzy  face this headon  okay howd that go  over earpiece   how easy   crying  thud groans    it would be to show me how you feel      more than words      is all you have to do to make it real      then you wouldnt have to say      that you    it was the worlds hottest pepper  she had it shipped  from sinaloa mexico oh no  oh gosh what happened to her  well the ambulance arrived just in time  the pepper burned holes in her esophagus  and she was in a medically induced coma for three days  thats why i cant just tell rachel to back off  these girls are too fragile  wow okay  how about this  why dont you take your own advice  right do what you told the kids to do  if youre if youre feeling awkward  telling rachel how you feel  then why dont you um you know sing it to her  let her down gently  and dont wear that tie    bum bum      bah bah   yeah  sing to me everything you feel  okay  uh  i cant i cant  i cant sing to a dude  you have to try  i cant okay  i cant  im sick and tired  of people pushing me to be somebody im not  your lashing out at me is fantastically compelling  and inappropriate  dude im sorry  youre really awesome kurt  i  im just under a load of crap right now  girls  theyre your problem  theyre up theyre down  girls  sighs  its the baby  shes my daughter and  theres so many things i want to say to her  and im never going to be able to  like what  well  like how i dont want her to think  that her father just abandoned her  how i would do anything for her  how no matter what i do im always thinking about her  how im going to spend my whole life loving her  and shes never even going to know  you got to let it out  how  by singing  ill stand by you by the pretenders  its in your wheelhouse  and i know you know it from the radio  because its a classic  and you do well with the classics  especially in the soft rock mode  yeah i do like that song but  how is it going to make me feel better again  by singing it out  to the audience  imagine your little girl  sitting there  thank god i never missed a piano lesson  playing ill stand by you intro    oh      why you look so sad      tears are in your eyes      come on and

see what i can do  ill report back later  quinn no youre wrong im right  im right okay she doesnt talk to other moms  how do you explain her constant irritation with you  its because shes a girl  no i think its the pregnancy hormones or something  they make her kind of nuts  its enough to want to give up women altogether  chuckles  yeah  anyway thanks for the advice  about singing to the baby like that  uh worked like a charm  i owe you one dude pats arm  kurt okay ill admit it  im madly in love with finn  i have been since the first time we met  dude  impulse control  he was my knight in shining armor  my feelings lingered stronger as we bonded over glee  then football  then skin care  your t zone is dangerously dry  your your t zone  oh  twice a day  its very mild and has a builtin sunblock  cool  thanks man  i dont know why i find his stupidity charming  i mean hes cheating off a girl  who thinks the square root of four is rainbows  i guess thats love for you  will hey  eyes on your own paper  i know it seems weird that im helping finn with quinn  but rest assured its all part of a master plan  no matter what i do or how much i assist him with his ballad  shes going to end up disappointing him  and breaking his heart  and then hell be crying into my shoulder pads  bell rings  okay so im really excited  i have picked a medley of songs  thats going to be a fantastic teaching tool  about how to sing a great ballad  why is miss pillsbury here  uh  um well i  i too am very curious about the power of the ballad  you know im thinking of doing some career counseling in song  emma want to just sat prep  yeah  yeah okay  rachel this is a mashup  of young girl by gary puckett and the union gap  and the 1980 police classic  dont stand so close to me  and i want you to listen very closely to the lyrics  because i really mean what im singing  really listen  okay  music plays    young teacher the subject      of schoolgirl fantasy      she wants him so badly

you have the time to change your mind      cause im afraid      youll go too far      dont stand      dont stand so      dont stand so close to me      young girl youre out of your mind      your love for me is way out of line      better run girl     dont stand      dont stand so      dont stand so close to me      youre much too young girl    both sigh  so rachel  do you think you understood the message  i was trying to get across with that ballad  yes it means im very young  and its hard for you to stand close to me  sighs  um no um  emma would you mind helping me out here  um was that the message that you got  youre a a very good performer  hes very good  rachel well i for one  cant wait to go home and work  on a medley of my own for tomorrow  because this lesson has given me  a lot to think about  no rachel that really wasnt the  you  bravo  thanks for coming over kurt  i know youre into fashion and that kind of stuff  and i need to find something nice to wear  to the fabrays for dinner so  i couldnt be more pleased and honored  to help you find something vintage and appropriate to wear  here it is  my mom never had the heart to throw this stuff out  chuckles  here hang on to that for the next time  puck throws you in the dumpster  my dads the same way  my mom died ten years ago  and he still keeps her toothbrush on the holder by their sink  the broken dresser in their room  still smells like her perfume  i know its stupid but sometimes ill sneak in there  and open all the drawers and lie on the floor  and close my eyes and just smell her  thats not stupid  i guess in a way im lucky i never knew him you know  chuckles  check this out  not half bad  chuckles  your father had good taste  i cant believe it fits  uh thanks  my father was brave enough  to fight in some desert thousands of miles away  and i cant even go over to dudley road  and tell the fabrays the truth  your father didnt charge into the breach emptyhanded  he had a weapon  you think i should bring a gun  nno i think you should use your greatest weapon  your voice  sighs  hey sweetie im home  something smells good  sighs  oh thanks  rachel youre welcome  casseroles almost ready  hope you like venison  why did you even let her in the house  cause she said she was one of your glee kids  it didnt take me five minutes  to realize shes in love with you  she asked if she could see your baby pictures  what so now youre making her clean our bathroom  look will i have been dealing  with these schoolgirl crushes for years  so why shouldnt i get a little something out of it  do you have any more ajax  oh in the linen closet sweetie  mouthing  this is immoral terri  no honey you know whats immoral  is me having to deal with the fact that my husband spends  all day with young girls who are perkier and younger than i am  i have a rash on my belly from that cocoa butter  that your mother sent me  do you have any idea how much it burns when i sweat  i cant scrub the floors as hard as she can  baby if its that bad you have to let me see it  it might be infected  what so now im going to show you  the bleeding pustules on my skin  wow yeah no thats not going to send you  into the loving arms of some teenage slut  for the last time  i am not having an affair with any of my students  and you are not allowed to turn one of them into your slave  because you have this irrational fear of me leaving you  but why not huh  if its winwin for everyone  look shes a really good cook  groans try it  where are you going  im taking rachel home  can you ask her to dust the blinds in the craft room first  rachel mr schuester  yes rachel  why do i have to sit in the backseat  um its the law  children have to ride in the back  children under seven  well im just concerned for your safety  really  um no not really  i think we should take advantage of this golden alone time  and practice our ballad  that would be great but i dont have  any music in the car  its okay i made us a cd  oh    ah crush      ah      i see you blowin me a kiss      it doesnt take a scientist      to understand whats going on baby    turns music off  it wasnt finished  yeah well the acoustics are horrible in the car  put your seat belt back on  so hows it going with puck  are you guys still seeing each other  i broke things off  he was too immature  as are all the boys in high school  i need a man who can keep up with me  intellectually and creatively  well thats a tough road for most high school boys  thats why i have my sights set much higher  stay away from him  youre going to get hurt bad  you cant threaten me pepper  im not afraid of you  you should be  oh youre on the second floor  oh youre right above me  girl you  i am a hot damn mess  i found out today that my hamster is pregnant  in biology class and i just started weeping  no no i think thats a great idea  were supposed to be rehearsing  im talking to tina  ill hit you back  this is bad dude  all our ballads are terrible  cause were all so distracted  were all worried about finn and quinn and babygate  we cant even sing about our emotions  cause were so worried about theirs  who cares  um we all do  so we decided were all going to sing them a ballad  to show that we got their backs  are you kidding me  theres no way im singing to them  groans its not fair  finn gets everything  he gets the sympathy he gets the girl  what is your problem  finns not the father  i am  what  all right look  you need to get something through your mohawk real quick  youre the babys daddy  it takes a hell of a lot more  to be a father and that roles already been cast  because quinn chose finn  and you need to accept that and move on  cause you have no business messing up that girls life  any more than you already have  you need to back off  you owe her at least that much  mmm its a lovely ham  thank you  there is no beating judys ham  laughs  well i cure all my own meats  id like to propose a toast  quinn daddy  no russell  and

all the other dads brought their sons  but my two girls  were enough for me  daddy  your sister made it through the whole game  but you fell asleep in my lap  i kept hoping nothing exciting would

we talk about this  finn is a good guy  he loves me  you too  get out of my house  you cant do that she didnt do anything wrong  please mrs fabray do something  dont bother finn  crying  if she wanted to do something she wouldve  when she found out that i was pregnant  you knew  i no  she didnt tell me anything  but you knew  and i needed you  i needed my mom  and you were so scared of what he would do  if he found out  you just pushed it aside  like we do  every bad feeling in this house  if you dont talk about it it doesnt exist  now do not turn this on us  you are the disappointment here  why  because im not a little girl anymore  because i made a mistake  who are you  i dont recognize you at all  im your daughter  who loves you  and who knows this must be really hard for you  but i just need my daddy to hold me  and tell me that its going to be okay  please  crying  sobbing judy  sighs  honey how many times have i told you  you gotta turn these tshirts right side out before you

 i have nothing to say to you pepper  if you continue to stalk me ill press charges  everyone knows what you are  youre the school crazy  i was crazy  crazy in love  theres nothing you can say thats going to change  the way i feel about mr schuester  ours is a love for the ages  your threats will just make our love grow stronger  let me tell you a few things i learned  from two years of intense psychotherapy  and an esophagus transplant  lesson number one  you and shue it wont work  what do you mean  were not so different you and me  were both mildly attractive  and extremely grating  love is hard for us  we look for boys we know we can never have  mr shue is a perfect target  for our selfesteem issues  he can never reciprocate our feelings  which only reinforces the conviction  that were not worthy of being loved  trust me  im a cautionary tale  you need to find some selfrespect rachel  get that mildly attractive groove back  mr schuester im ready when you are  the ballad ive selected has an important message  that im anxious for you to hear  rachel im sorry im going to have to stop you  the way youve been acting is totally inappropriate  im your teacher rachel and im sorry  but thats all im ever going to be  i know  i  brought these for you as an apology  and the song i was going to sing was  sorry seems to be the hardest word by elton john  cause i know how much you love it  im such an idiot  mooning over you and cleaning your apartment  hey  its okay  i know its not always easy for you rachel  and i know that there are some things about yourself  that you think youd like to change  sniffling but you should know that there is some boy out there  whos going to like you for everything you are  including those parts of you that even you dont like  those are going to be the things he likes the most  thanks mr shue  what do you say we ditch rehearsal today  chuckles  ive got to be honest rachel  youve never really needed much help with your ballads  youve been knocking them out of the park since day one  do you like them  theyre great  so they just kicked her out  yeah  gave her half an hour to pack  father set the timer on the microwave  im sorry  i guess my plan kind of sucked  no uh this is good  no more secrets  you know everythings out there  all the feelings  and thats better right  yes better  good  all right well uh lets work on your ballad  you were really helpful when i was trying to find mine  so what is it  i honestly love you  sounds awesome  i dont know the song or whatever  but it sounds positive and nice and stuff
