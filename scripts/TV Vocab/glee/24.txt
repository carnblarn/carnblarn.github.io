want to hear about him  now some people think of the term  easy listening as a bad thing  but im going to let this music speak for itself  you guys love lady gaga and the rolling stones  and you guys are really good about putting it all out there  but really good music  can also be controlled  and restrained  it doesnt have to attack an audience  it can let them come to you  finn how could you get caught  between the moon and new york city  theyre like a hundred miles apart  mr shue if i may  i think i speak for all of us when i say  its not that we dont love the idea of spending a week  on this silky smooth adult contemporary  its just that as teens this isnt the easiest music  for us to relate to  however there is  a burgeoning facebook campaign  that has swell to over five members

grammy award winner  brittany i would just like to say that from now on  i demand to have every solo in glee club  what when i had my teeth cleaned  i had the most amazing britney spears fantasy  i sang and danced better than her  now i realize what a powerful woman i truly am  i went with her and i had a britney fantasy too  although now that im thinking  about it im not really sure how  our fantasies combined  santana that doesnt make any sense  see mr shue i told you  britney spears busted our brit out of her everyday fragmented  haze of confusion and gave her  the confidence to step up and perform  im more talented than all of you  i see that clearly now  its brittany bitch  guys were not doing britney spears and thats that  mr shue youre letting your own personal issues  get in the way of something that  we are all telling you we  really want to do  i mean this club regularly pays tribute to pop culture  and britney spears is pop culture  to suggest otherwise is heretical  kurt im done talking about this  geez let loose a little would you  stop being so frickin uptight all the time  kurt  ill see you in the principals office  girl uhoh  bell rings  will and carl ah  harmonizing ah   all right evidence of some grinding  ill set you up with a night guard  fantastic  happy to do it  all right can we stop this right now what  well this is clearly awkward for the two of us  all right lets talk it out brotobro  fine bro  i still have feelings for emma strong feelings  so do i  the difference is she chose me  i dont know whats gonna happen with emma and i  but i do ask is that you back off until we figure it out  what if i tell you that i dont think i could do that  rinse  will put yourself in my shoes  i mean say it doesnt work out  between the two of us and she chooses to go back to you  how would you feel if i continue to come after her  okay fine ill back off  but the second she starts leaning my way i am back in  deal  deal now open back up  i want to continue this examination  ah no more ahs  oh you know what  i got just the thing for you  candy  you gotta loosen up and bang bro  i mean youre grinding  those beautiful little teeth down to nubs  you know i honestly think thats why you  and emma didnt work out  theres not an impulsive bone between the two of you  and you think eating candy is gonna change that  you gotta get ridiculous bro  you gotta just start doing  things that feel good for no good reason  you know i used to get up at the same time  ever day and have the same eggs  then one day im driving the hybrid to work  i pass a chevy dealership  the new corvettes had just come in so i stopped  right on the spot i make a uturn and i buy one  now i take the top down take emma for a spin  she doesnt even care if her hair gets messed up  you follow me  hey rachel  hey mr shue  you all set you need me to stay with you or anything  no ive been taking herbal antianxiety pills and reading  the unauthorized biography of britney spears to stay calm  i look forward to the day the paparazzi provokes me  and i attack them  are you okay  did you have a cavity or something  is that candy  im fine  good luck  sighs  bell ringing

not like when i went all sad clown hooker  and put on that ridiculous grease cat suit  this is just like my regular look  with the volume turned up  ooh baby you can hit me  as many times as you want  as long as you got that on  how come all the gay guys always get  the hottest chicks  you see what im talking about  theyre personifying you  objectifying  whatever just tell me  why its okay for you to feel safer with me  not on the football team  but its not okay for me to feel safer with you  in your old reindeer sweater  look i see your point  in order for this relationship to work  we cant control each other  so you have my blessing to rejoin the football team  if you can  girl it looks like a jewish cloud  what do you want for her  ill give you anything ill give you my house  ill kill my parents and ill give you my house  finn groans  bell rings wanky wanky  i kinda liked your old car chuckles  that car was a metaphor for everything that was wrong  with my life my fear of change  laughs  that dragging muffler was like the chains of marleys ghost  sighs now theyre gone and i feel like a free man  by buying the same car as carl  his didnt have heated seats  oh come on emma im just doing everything  you said i should do  im loosening up and i feel amazing  lets take her for a spin  christopher crosss sailing plays  oh this is my jam  well its not that far to paradise   at least its not for me   and if the wind is right we can sail away   and find tranquility   shrieks  get out of the car  watch this  im taking this back to the dealer  oh hey home wrecker  do i have to remind you that we are divorced  i am reminded every month when i get my spousal support check  the one that i know you cant send me  if youre buying a car that you cant afford  will emma  you know what actually  i think you should keep this car  you should enjoy it you know  at leastntil they repossess it  but just dont buy any more bigticket items okay  why is that  because someday you are going to come to your senses will  and youre going to get over that little miss crazypants  and youre going to come back to the one woman  who really knows how to love you  and i just dont want you to have blown  all of our savings when you do  damn  bell ringing  santana well rachel congratulations  normally you dress like the fantasy  of a perverted japanese businessman  with a very dark specific fetish  but i actually dig this look  yay thank you  kurt i think what santana is trying to say rachel  though i risk expulsion by saying so  is that it seems britney spears has really helped you blossom  thats all  will wait rachel is that true  i mean you are sort of dressing differently  artie bouncy bouncy bouncy  hey hey rachel look all i know is that i had  a very vivid britney spears fantasy at the dentist  and since then its made me feel free  to get out of my own way  i think ive just always been afraid  to dress like a pretty girl  because ive never really felt like one before  now i realize its okay to feel that way  about yourself every now and again  and maybe its a good thing  its such a good thing i cant believe it  william a word  bell ringing  you have got to be kidding me  i was headed to the library computers  late last night  to score my cheerios some cheap tickets on one of those  offbrand airlines with shoddy safety records  you know to fly my jv squad  so if the plane did go down  well it wouldnt be that big of a deal  but then horror  jacob over computer rachel are you aware youve never  been hotter than you are right now  dressed as britney spears rachel thank you  jacob can i put some clothes on please  no  i want you to feel the beads of your own sweaty  depraved stank dripping down your butt crack  rachel berry was dressing like britney spears  and i was titillated oh dear god  if you know what i mean  that is really gross sue but theyre kids  hormones  william i realize youre still mourning the loss  of that bony redheaded hominid youre in love with  i understand that  i also understand that you bought  a brandnew car to impress her  youre flailing william  now im secretly hoping its a midlife crisis  which means youre halfway to an early death  affording me a blissful demented convalescence  spent peeing on your grave  chuckles whats your point sue  dont let your own recklessness blind you to the fact  that britney spears is a genius  popculture provocateur and a gateway drug  to every outofcontrol impulse ever created  this school is a powder keg of sexual deviance william  and in my office  i have a chair with a naked butt sweat stain to prove it  im not kidding  its like an inkblot test that butt sweat stain  stare into it william  and you will see the light of all that is good  go out of the world  wait just a second now  you look more confused than ever  is your glee club doing britney spears music  is that why rachel was wearing  that inappropriate outfit  no  no we are not doing britney  okay just

 how come everyones having britney spears fantasies  the nitrous oxide dentists use is a mild hallucinogen  studies have proven that it induces vivid dreams  often the last thing the patient thinks of  the subconscious moves to the forefront  since weve all been thinking  so much about britney  it only stands to reason  okay guys listen up  mr shue if i may  kurt i overheard what you guys were just talking about  and i know what youre going to say  the answer is no  no im not going to stand in the way anymore  if you guys want to do britney  at this years homecoming assembly im fine with it

screaming  sex party into the microphones of  all three major networks  okay im pretty sure none of that happened  you can expect a call very soon from my lawyer  gloria allred  im gonna sue the pants
