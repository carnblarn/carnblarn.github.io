of teenage drinking  can i count on you william  emma hi  enough with us not being friends  look i heard through the grapevine that you and carl  started looking for a tract house together  and i just wanted to say  that im genuinely happy for you  thank you  thats really sweet  twoslicer  do you want to catch up  yeah sure  how have you been  busy yeah  glee clubs gearing up for regionals  i um love hearing about the glee club  but im actually more interested in you  you know how youre doing me uh  are you dating anybody  no  no  maybe you should  you know ella i think  will should really concentrate on his treatment  before he tries another relationship  with an early hominid even a human female  treatment alcoholics anonymous will  i suggest you preemptively check  into rehab as you are a future alcoholic  i mean come on  look where you are youre coaching a glee club  that can only beat choirs of old people  youre rehashing the details of your failed marriage  with the very lemur who rejected the bestial horror  of your craven sexual advances  and when my glee club crushes you at regionals  well the last ounce of meaning will drain from your life  and you will turn to drink  i dont get it how is it  that youre now coaching a glee club  i was so inspired by my stint in the glee club  that i took the trip to westvale  and i volunteered my help  unfortunately the chipper homosexual  who coaches aural intensity  had a terrible fall down the stairs  im okay dont worry  not to be alarmed  doctors say he will be fine provided they can get  the swelling in his brain under control  okay sorry i still dont understand  how can the school let you coach aural intensity  newsflash amelda  theres no one lining up to coach glee clubs  because its a sucky job for losers  but there was an opening and i am a champion  oh will heres the book by bill w  outlining the 12 steps of alcoholics anonymous  i cant wait for you to start climbing those steps  because when you get to the top  im gonna knock you back down  whats up my hot little jewishamerican princess  what do you want puckerman  well word on the street is that your dads are out of town  and youre all alone in

tension  we were boyfriend and girlfriend finn  its silly for us to pretend  like we arent comfortable around each other  yeah totally  and i know that we have some unresolved feelings  but like my two new role models carole king and gerry goffin  i think its important that we just  put them aside and stay focused on our mission  which is just to write an amazing song  to win regionals with

alcohol d  well done you guys  i mean you always bring it  with the singing and the dancing  but what i was really impressed with today  was your acting  i truly thought  that some of you guys were drunk  we take our craft serious  problem is that song is great  but itit kind of glorifies drinking dont you think  were supposed to sing about the dangers  of alcohol for this assembly  well good luck finding a song that does that  mr shue  first of all that vest is very cute  you are all kinds of awesome  but second maybe theres really no songs  about the dangers of drinking because theres really none  as long as you have a proper designated driver  i ever told you how great you are  whoa well rachel yeah  driving drunk is dangerous  and have you guys ever heard of alcohol poisoning  yeah it kills about 400 people every year uh  santana are you are you crying  im okay im okay  youre such a hypocrite  you drink most adults do  well i may have a beer every now and then  but i dont i dont get drunk  were just saying this is a waste of time  i mean were totally aware of alcohol  we see adults drinking it and having fun  every commercial during nascar  is for beer  okay enough guys  look tomorrow come with your thinking caps on  because were going to spend the entire day  brainstorming ideas for songs  to sing at this assembly  am i out of touch  i mean i used to drink a lot more when i was their age  most of the time it was just to deal with terri but i mean  who am i to tell them not to drink  when i blacked out a couple of times  when i was their age and i ended up okay  youre taking this way too hard  something else going on  lets see  um my divorce is starting to really sink in  sues coaching my competition at regionals  and emma is looking for a house with her husband  is that all  what do you do  for stress relief exercise  well me too but thats a little too close to being productive  you got to get a little ridiculous man burn off  some of that angst you have any suggestions  tomorrow night  youre tagging along with me for my stress relief  were going to  a little place they call rosalitas roadhouse  isnt that like a honkytonk bar  you aint lived till youve seen me in a d cowboy hat d  d so far away d  d doesnt anybody stay in one place anymore d  i didnt drink that much are you kidding  you spent the entire night sucking rachel berrys face  that sir is what we call rock bottom  oh my god speak of the devil  two medium drips  hi rachel  kurt and i were just talking about you  youre such a cutie pie with your blazer and your pants  so  i have a

out on one crummy little date  youre gay blaine i thought i was but  ive never even had a boyfriend before  isnt this the time youre supposed to figure stuff out  i cant believe that im hearing this right now maybe im bi i dont know  bisexuals a term that gay guys in high school use  when they want to hold hands with girls and feel like  a normal person for a change whoa wait wait  why are you so angry because i look up to you  i admire how proud you are  of who you are i know what its like  to be in the closet and here you are  about to tiptoe back in im really sorry if this hurts your feelings  or your pride or whatever  but however confusing it might be for you  its actually a lot more confusing for me  youre 100 sure who you are  fantastic  well maybe we all cant be so lucky  yeah i have ive had a lot of luck blaine  i was really lucky to be chased out of high school  by a bully who threatened to kill me  and why did he do that  because he didnt like who i was  sort of exactly what youre saying to me right now  isnt it  i am  im searching okay  i am honestly just trying to figure out  who i am and for you  of all people to get down on me for that  i didnt think thats who you were  ill see you  id say bye but i wouldnt want to make you angry  d last night i d  d went to town d  d hit every bar around d  d a hundred bottles of beer on the wall d  d i thought i

1000 are you sure youre not here  just to find out how my date with blaine went  oh was that tonight  look were friends so  im gonna be honest with you  d d  the date was lovely  we saw love story at the revival theater  we even dressed up as the characters  thats not gay at all  did you kiss no our lips  spent the evening mouthing ali mcgraws dialogue  frankly i did expect a little snog  as the date drew to a close but  i guess the timing just wasnt right  or the bloodalcohol level  look i know that you have feelings for him  and im sure you think im crazy for asking him out  but blaine is obviously conflicted  and if he turns out not  to be gay well then i guess i will have done you a favor  and im doing you a favor by telling you that blaine  is the first of a long line of conflicted men that  you will date that will later  turn out to be only thmost flaming of homosexuals  blaine and i have a lot in common  a sentiment expressed by many a hag about many a gay  look i dont doubt that you and blaine  would have a jolly good time shopping at burberry  and arguing who would make  the better rum tum tugger  i dont dispute that  but theres something you and blainell never have  and thats chemistry  fine  then im gonna prove you wrong  im gonna take  the beer goggles off and im gonna kiss him sober  and if the spark is still there then im taking you  to your bakery of choice for a piping hot slice of humble pie  whoa whoa whoa easy partner  can i get you something to drink  oh no no no no  taxis waiting all right  hhhow are you not drunk  we drank exactly the same amount  i got a hollow leg  you got a hollow leg  you gonna be okay  oh yeah yeah yeah  i just just got to grade some papers  and im still looking  for a song for the kids to sing  at the alcohol awareness assembly  oh yes uh  the kids want to sing a keha song  but uh it just makes drinking seem like a lot of fun  sometimes it is fun  exactly  like tonight  thats the most fun ive had in a really long time  i mean we were careful mmhmm  we didnt drive mm yeah  whats wrong with that  nothin  nothins wrong with that  except were not teenagers anymore will  you know  the way i see it  you cant just lecture kids  i mean we cant stop them from drinking  if thats what theyre gonna do  i mean the best we can do  is make them aware of the dangers and just  hope theyre smart enough  to make a good decision on their own  nut all right buddy im out of here  okay dont get up  im not  all right hey yes  you just make sure you drink lots of water  okay mwa  i love you  right back at you  yay happy face  okay  that was a valiant effort  you get a aplus  thats how i roll  i dont even know who you are  oh what the hell  hey there  sexy lady  i know its late  and i know youre taken  and ive had a couple drinks but  theres something i rreally really want to say to you  william  cant wait to see what your new directions are planning  for the assembly i know weve had issues  with your kids performing in front of the school  but i have a really good feeling about this one  why are you screaming  im not screaming are you okay  oh wow your cologne is just really strong  its drakar noir  emma ooh  will you look terrible  considering how much i drank  i think im lucky to be alive  although i kind of wish i was dead  i am so embarrassed  why i mean besides the fact that you drank  like a frat boy and youre well into your 30s  please dont make me say it sorry  i dont even remember half the things i said to you iim not following  ii drunkdialed you last night  no you didnt  i mean i didnt get a single message  what would you have said that youd be embarrassed about  nothing  iii this must have been  a really elaborate uh booze dream yeah  its time will  ive arranged to have you committed for 48 hours  and its not gonna be easy  those state institutions tend to turn the fire hose  on patients going through the dts  but at this point i have no other option  but a forced intervention  sue i do not have a drinking problem  really then whats with the corey hart imitation  will im trying to save you  why all you ever want to do is destroy me  yeah well its kind of like nursing a pow back to health  so hes at his strongest when you torture him to death  all right will you had your chance  to do this the easy way  souffle is all about the whites  if you get yolk in it or you dont let it stiffen properly  then you might as well be making pancakes  all right you think the one we already made is ready yet  i hope so  all right lets check it out  here we go  tada  you didnt leave enough room in the dish to let it rise  hey im sorry why are you being so hard on me  i wouldve been happy with you teaching me to make toast  im sorry dad i know this is supposed to be bonding time but  its blaine  hes interested in rachel  im confused i thought he was gay too  oh he is he is  hes just experimenting  yeah hes not the only one  what does that mean  look i need you to ask me  before you have someone sleep over  wewe were fullylothed the entire time  and blaine was too drunk to drive so i let him crash here  i was being responsible  wait a minute you kids are drinking now  finn and i didnt have any  if thats what youre worried about  no im worried  about you being inappropriate in my house  and if puckerman had a sleepover with finn  would that be inappropriate  thats different because they wouldnt have sex  no i would never allow finn to have a girl sleep over  in his bed  but would it make you uncomfortable if he did  hey when have i been uncomfortable  with you being gay so its not being gay that upsets you  its just me acting on it  i dont know what two guys do when theyre together  you know i sat through that whole brokeback mountain  from what i gather  something went down in the tent  okay what do you want from me here dad i  i want you to apologize for being inappropriate  and promise me youll never do it again  fine im sorry  i wont have sleepovers with anyone that might be gay  without asking you first  thank you  but maybe you could step outside your comfort zone  and educate yourself so if i have any questions  i could go to my dad like any straight son could   quiet please children  i would like to wish you and yours  a healthy and happy alcohol awareness week  unfortunately  kitty dukakis could not be

 me so sick but if it werent for drinking the assembly would  have been a disaster i for one am never drinking again  being thrown up on it just does something to a person  all right guys while im happy things worked out  with the assembly  i never want to see you guys pull anything like that again  drinking while performing is unprofessional  drinking while at school is just stupid  and most importantly  any of you guys drinking at all is illegal  theres a fair amount of the pot  calling the kettle black right now  that is so racist  i couldnt agree more  which is why im going to stop drinking  not even a beer at the end of the night to take the edge off  but if you dont drink  what will you have to live for  i have plenty in my life without beer  like what exactly  the point is im going to stop  and i hope you guys do too  isnt that kind of unrealistic  yeah honestly i think it is  which is why im only going to ask you to do it  until after nationals  consider yourselves like prize fighters  getting ready for a big heavyweight bout  now these are pledge forms  and i want you guys  to sign them  and what if we fall off the wagon again  look in the top corner of your form  thats my cell phone number yes  part of your pledge is that if you do slip up  no matter where you are or what time of the night it is  i want you to call me to drive you home  we got lucky this time that the only consequences  of your drinking was some illtimed vomiting  none of us wants to see any of you guys get hurt  cool beans mr shue ill sign this  me too i mean alcohol has done nothing  for my songwriting  what about after we win nationals  im buying the sparkling cider  yes  so you said he comes this way at 330  like clockwork for his postrehearsal medium drip  i just cant wait to lay one on him  ive got a bad feeling about this rachel  i mean i dont mean to be schooled  but i dont want you to get hurt either  theres no victory in this for me either way  who cares about you buddy  i might get a new boyfriend out of this  who can keep up with me vocally and in the future  give me vaguely eurasian looking children  there he is  dreamy as ever  okay wish me luck  d i feel the earth move under my feet d  hey rachel whats going on  d i feel the sky tumbling down d  d atumbling down d  d i feel the earth move d  d under my feet d  d i feel the sky tumbling down d  d atumbling down i just lose control d  huh  yep  im gay   thank you so much for clearing that up for me rachel  listen save my space in line will you  i got to go hit the restroom  d all over d  d i feel the earth move under my feet d  d i feel the sky d  that was hard wasnt it  are you kidding  that was amazing  i am speechless  i just had  a relationship with a guy who turned out to be gay  that is songwriting gold  oh  okay i have to go compose  but thank you thank you
