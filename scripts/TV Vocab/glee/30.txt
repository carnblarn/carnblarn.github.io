want to boogie with carole at this wedding  and i will boogie  all right its already taken care of dad  im going to hire the new directions as your band  right it wont cost you a cent  theyre cheap theyre available  long story short  youre having a glee wedding  today is a redletter day  the big day has finally arrived for one sue sylvester  becky get in here  get these invites down to the post office stat  got it coach  and to think that this joyous occasion began in horror  which is why i just prefer to think of the homeless as outdoorsy  so shine on urban campers  you smell like adventure  and thats how sue sees it  sue youre the bees knees  before we break  id like to make an announcement  rod and i are engaged  i popped the question in my buildings  commonuse hot tub booyah  not to worry ladies  its an open marriage  well be right back  how dare you humiliate me like that  people know you and i dated  sue you cant tame the tiger  youve read my tattoos  face it sue  youre never going to find someone  and youre going to die alone  so i decided to try online dating  and there was only one match for sue sylvester  one sue sylvester  so thanks edesperate  im over the moon  or maybe im a little high off this adhesive  but i want to scream from the highest mountain  sue sylvester is marrying herself  hey is that safe  with your shoulder messed up and all  doesnt feel messed up to me now that im healthy  im going to be gunning to get my job back  well coach beiste isnt going to replace me while were winning  you cant win every game  look i still want to be friends its just  im kind of on the cusp of being one of the most popular guys in school  wow i uh  i didnt think you were the type that cared about that stuff  everyone does being on top  means you dont have to take crap from anybody  no teasing no slushee facials  being quarterback isnt going to put you on top  especially since you cant even get quinn to be your girlfriend  im working on that too  so what do you want to talk about in private  these galactic mobiles arent the stars of mckinley  we are  or at least i want us to be  okay  i think i love you  look my shoulders healed im going to be the quarterback again soon  and youre already the head cheerleader  oh my god are you proposing  weve known each other for six weeks stand up   youre freaking me out  i want to marry you  some day until then  will you accept this promise ring  what are you six  if you accept  this ring will symbolize my promise to you to be true  to never pressure you to do anything more than kiss  to listen to your problems  to tell you when you have food in your teeth  or eye gunk to come over to your house whenever you need  something super heavy moved around  i promise to make you feel proud  when you point down the hall and say  that dudes my boyfriend  and i promise to do all of those things  without ever trying to sound like matthew mcconaughey  i really care about you quinn  and i want us to be together  is that a no  its a maybe  hey uh so ive been reviewing this itinerary  and i dont really get it  are you sure we should release  wont that get kind of messy  thats why we feed them glitter finn  oh well look ive been thinking about it  i really want to do something special for the wedding and  i wanted to take this opportunity  to sort of remind everyone that im you know a leader  i have the perfect idea  after you walk your mom down the aisle  and give her away to my dad  incredibly creepy  and give your speech to the newlyweds  which i will write although you are free  to suggest overall themes  you and carole will have a lovely  motherandson dance in front of everyone  ah thats a terrible idea  everybody knows im the worst dancer  finn trust me on this  ive been planning weddings since i was two  my power rangers got married and divorced  in so many combinations they were like fleetwood mac  i guess if i could pull it off  it would make me seem like a cool stud  totally  thanks its a plan  i dont want you near me  can i have this  thanks  are you okay  no no  okay lets go to the principal come on  did he physically hurt you  no  you said hes shoved you into the lockers before  well i cant expel a kid for shoving  hell just say i didnt mean to shove that kid i tripped  excuse works like a charm  i use it all the time  he didnt shove me this time  he just terrified me  lady i cant suspend a student because he scares you  high school is a dry run for the rest of your life  its rough people can be mean  thats your advice  thats all you have to say  william i was bullied my entire life  i grew up with a handicapable sister  i know very well how cruel people can be  was it difficult yes  did it make me stronger  you bet it did  its the fear thats the worst  i never know when its coming i cant concentrate  i dont feel like im part of this school at all  i feel like im in a horror movie where this creature  follows me around terrifying me  and theres nothing that i can do about it  i mean you  you dont know whats going on in this kids head  you dont know what hes capable of  what does that mean  nothing maybe im overreacting  lady this kid lays a finger on you you come straight to me  and i will expel him faster  than a thai takeout place can read back your delivery order  okay  but until that happens  and im genuinely sorry to say this  there is nothing legally i or the school board can do  come on kurt  were gonna be late for rehearsal  you know when you call me lady thats bullying  and its really hurtful  im sorry i thought that was your name  as an apology ill allow you  to choose from the following nicknames  gelfling porcelain and ticklemedoughface  i guess ill go with porcelain  damn totally wanted ticklemedoughface  ladies the kurtkarofsky bullying situation  is getting way out of control  kurts miserable hes losing weight  and not in a good way  and hes barely even fighting me for solos anymore  weve all been teased but something  about what karofskys doing is so much worse  were all lucky enough to have boyfriends on the football team  i say we band together and demand that they confront karofsky  okay first off all im not dating sam  and second of all  i think you personally just set  the feminist movement back 50 years  but guys like karofsky only respond to muscle  so were going to fight violence with violence no  look im not saying that they should hit him  what im saying is that we need to defend kurt  and theres strength in numbers  im confused are you and artie officially dating now  deal with it  when you guys fooled around did he ever like  just lie there  why didnt you tell me that we were having  a glee girls meeting  this is a meeting for glee girls with boyfriends  were going to make them stop karofsky from bullying kurt  okay im dating puckerman youre getting naked with puckerman  besides puck cant mess with karofsky hes on probation  if he gets in a fight with him hell be sent back to juvee  mmhmm yeah so now if youll excuse us  youre so on my list dwarf  look if something bad happens to kurt  and we didnt do anything to stop it  well never be able to live with ourselves  im a little confused  i said not only am i marrying myself  i will be officiating the ceremony  im not um  marsha dean when i hired you  and your crack team at marsha dean weddings  i did so because you specialize in unique weddings  well that mostly means that some of them take place outside  marsha dean you are fired  you are out of your depth  and nothing is too good for sue sylvester  well thats one way to look at it  hello  im doris sylvester  im this ones mother  marsha ill bet people say you look mannish  but you know something  i think its perfectly all right for a woman to be handsome  takes all kinds  susie come give your mother a hug  please dont call me that  come on come on  oh you poked me in my sternum  i always forget that you have this ribcage  thats kind of weird  and adorable i think ill sit down  mom what are you doing here  good news suze we finally caught the last nazi  for two and a half years weve been hot  on the trail of eva brauns greatnephew chad  and you know what hes been under our noses this whole time  working in phoenix as a cpa  i felt bad taking him out  i mean its punishment enough to live there  you ever been to phoenix its a hellhole  mom where have you been  i havent seen you or heard from you   in over three years  what do you mean  ii wrote you all those postcards  i mean granted they were decoys  have you been to see jean yet  its the top of my list  look i uh  i know its been a long time but  the work i was doing was important  and i always wanted to get back here  and be a mother to you girls again  and susie i have to ask you  what is it with this ridiculous wedding  have you given up on love  no mother quite the opposite  i mean when you were little  the other mothers used to tell me that youd never find anybody  but i said no no no no  shes a perfectly okay child  shell grow into her looks  and you know what  i believe you still might  mother i am going through with this wedding  and you are free to accept the invitation or not   are you inviting me  im inviting you now  well i am accepting dont get so huffy  since your fathers no longer with us i want to   walk you down the aisle  no im doing that  then i know exactly what im going to do  you remember when you were a little girl  and you used to ask me to sing to you  and i never had the time  so youd line up your little dollies  and theyd sing to each other  appalachian murder ballads  but it was touching  you know something though  im going to be there for you this time  im going to sing at your wedding  but why karofsky plays right guard  if he gets pissed at me im going to get sacked more times  than jay cutler which means were going to lose  which means beiste is going to make sam quarterback  is being quarterback more important to you  than helping out the kid whos going to be your stepbrother  look we both know i can help him more if i stay on top  look kurts going to be fine  rachel im sorry  i want to but i cant  ive never been so disappointed in you before  but  stop picking on kurt  you mind im changing  were serious  this is a warning oh yeah  from now on youre gonna leave him alone  look if he wants to be a homo  thats up to him but dont rub it in my face  were not asking you  yeah were done talking about this  just back off all right  look you back off hey  artie are you okay  hey hey hey whats going on  get up get up here get up  what the hells going on here  dude was a wild animal  manimal im so turned on by you right now  how bad does it look its pretty hot actually  you have no idea how hard  it was for me not to jump into that beatdown  where were you finn  i was still out on the field okay  i totally would have given  him a beatdown if i had been there though  the fact is it shouldnt have gone down without you finn  you should have been leading the charge  lay off finn everyone it isnt his problem  its none of your problems actually  but thank you for what you did especially sam  serious an epitome of a leader  whats going on  what happened to sams eye  he stood up to karofsky  all the guys did well not finn  is everyone okay   do we all need to go talk to principal sylvester  no  i got in a few good licks too so we can just call it even  and maybe this will send a warning to karofsky  telling him to back off kurt  you okay kurt  all right guys lets take our places  we got a wedding to prepare for  well mr piano man  i think i owe you an apology  not to worry susieq  i arranged for us to spend an hour in here  with that uh that cutiepie whats his

burt and carole  tell you in their own words why theyve invited you here today  im not really known for having a way with words  uh you know when youre a kid  adults will tell you a lot of things  but one thing they neglect to mention is how  sad life can be  i lost somebody i loved very much  but kurt  he lost his mom  and that killed me  well we got by but looking back  ii want to apologize to you kurt  what we were living just wasnt living  you know that saying that when god  closes a door he opens a window  well sometimes out of nowhere hell do you one better  and hell kick a whole wall

kampf i sent you right  yes i did  thank you youre welcome  oh what in the gd hell  thats enough  dearly beloved we are gathered today  to join sue sylvester and sue sylvester in holy matrimony  jeannie give me the rings  this is insane  sue do you take sue to be your lawfully wedded spouse  i do  and sue do you take sue  to be your lawfully wedded spouse  i do  by the power vested in me by a web site  i hereby pronounce you sue and sue  you may kiss yourself  im sorry  im sorry but this is crazy  this whole thing is crazy  i had my heart  set on singing during the ceremony  i dont want to be singing as youre walking out  i want to have a special moment with you girls  we girls have had lots of special moments mother  you just werent there  i resent that  and i also resent the fact  that you are keeping me in the background  at my own daughters wedding which  i am sorry to say i still think is bizarre  you know when i finally began to like who i am  when i stopped trying to please you  so jean and i had to learn how to become our own family  and you cant just waltz in here after all this time  and start calling the shots youre a bully mother  its taken till now to realize it  but you are a bully i am not  mother i cannot remember a conversation with you  where i didnt walk away feeling worse about myself  well you know what susan  im disappointed in you  im sorry to say mother  you are no longer invited to my wedding  what about my song  you are welcome to sing the sound of silence  in your hotel room right now  all right  and to think i was going to send you  to israel for your honeymoon  they love me there  you look beautiful  youre beautiful  hi  arnica twice a day  itll help your bruise  thanks  ive been thinking a lot about what you did for kurt  it made a real impact  i thought the only impact that was made was  karofskys fist impacting my face  you saw what finn did at the wedding  that was because of you  weve been talking this whole time  and you havent even noticed that im wearing your ring  howd you get that  i broke into your locker  ive always been really handy with a nail file  really mmhmm  this is absolutely unacceptable  this psycho threatens my kids life  and some school board made up of a bunch of people ive never met  tells me theres nothing they can do about it  oh they could do something about it  they just decided not to  no one reported witnessing him being violent  and theres no way to prove  that he threatened you with violence  the school board president issued a verbal warning  to karofsky and thats where we stand  i cant go back to being terrified all the time  i jump every time a locker slams shut  i flinch whenever i turn the corner  i dont feel safe at the school  kids who bully for the most part  have been bullied themselves  and i for one dont flatter myself  that that behavior can change  now this kid karofsky isnt gonna all of a sudden  be nice to you and i wont stand by  unable to do anything about it  effective noon tomorrow figgins is back in charge  as ive tendered my resignation as principal in protest  i cant help you behind that desk  but i can be an extra pair of eyes out in those hallways  someone ought to have your back  besides i miss my office this room smells weird  i cant shake the feeling that im inhaling a lot of dead skin  well i guess ill try to enjoy the rest of the day  before the terror starts anew  ill see you at home  hey kurt wait up a second theres something  we want to talk to you about  come on guys the wedding was great  but we have got to get ready for sectionals next week  kurt good i want to talk to you about this amazing idea  i had for a solo for you at sectionals  can i make an announcement first  yeah  first i wanted to thank everyone for what you did  at my dads wedding especially finn  its nice to know that i have great friends here  as well as a true brother  which is why its so hard for me to leave  what do you mean leave  im transferring to dalton academy immediately  my parents are using the money they saved up  for their honeymoon to pay for the tuition  kurt you cant leave  what the hell dude  how about you talk with me about this first  im sorry finn but theres nothing to talk about  karofskys coming back tomorrow  so that means i wont be  we can protect you seriously we can like  form a perimeter around you like the secret service  yeah the only thing  that can really protect me is what they have  a zero tolerance no bullying policy its enforced  corrected by arnozet
