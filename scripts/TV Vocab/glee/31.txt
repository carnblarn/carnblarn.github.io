                house seats to sectionals  those things are hard to come by  scalpers are getting like five bucks for them  i however as coach of one of the competing teams get two  and i would be honored if you would be my plus one  i mean you being at sectionals  isis kind of a good luck charm for us  i would love to  i mean not that were gonna need any talismans  i have a killer set list planned  first no let me guess  finn and rachel are gonna do a ballad right  followed by the kids joining in  with a classic rock number where mercedes will belt out  the last jawdropping note  have you been going through my desk  its what you always do  every team tries to showcase their strongest players  look just seeing your kids do the rocky horror thing  really reminded me of how much talent youve got in glee club  quinn has a beautiful voice  and mike chang has dance moves that are  to die for  look im sure that you know  what youre doing im not saying that  everyone has picked you as favorites for sectionals  you won your sectional last year  its just i dont know you guys used to be the underdogs  now youre a real team which is wonderful  youre a constellation of stars  i would just hate to think  that you might be ignoring some of them  because they dont burn quite as obviously bright  ive said too much  no  you said just enough  mr schuester i have an announcement  ive selected the perfect moving ballad  for finn and i to sing to launch our performance at sectionals  me first two things  first our competition at sectionals  are your classic stool choirs  great voices but they dont move  now if were gonna beat them  we need to do what they cant dance  which is why ive decided to feature  brittany and mike changs sweet moves in our performance  wait theyre gonna dance in front of me while i sing my solo  youre not getting a solo for this competition rachel  finally so what song do i get to sing  i was thinking that the winners of our duets competitions  would take the leads  ken and barbie  aare you trying to throw this  you used to be just sort of unlikable but now  i pretty much feel like punching you  every time you open your mouth  okay listen i have talked the talk  about everyone in here feeling special for over a year now  but frankly i havent walked the walk  i mean we have got a lot of talent here  and im gonna highlight it  do something  look im all for pumping up the team  making everyone feel special but thats for practice  you dont take the star quarterback out   before the big game  yep  easy to say when youre the star quarterback  this isnt just about me this is about the team  you are such a hypocrite  like you even know what that means  it means that your boyfriend is full of crap hobbit  you know what ever since the wedding  youve been up my butt and im sick of it  come on rachel shes not worth it  oh really  cause thats not what you thought  last year in that motel room  thats right yentl  your sweetheart hes been lying to you  cause he and i totally got it on last year  okay enough already  no more conversations about this oror anything  this is our plan for sectionals  and that is that  mike brittany  come on up lets start choreographing  and now lets welcome the newest addition to the warblers  kurt hummel  and our oldest tradition for our newest warbler  an actual warbler  kurt meet pavarotti  this bird is a member of an unbroken line of canaries  who have been at dalton since 1891  its your job to take care of him  so he can live to carry on the warbler legacy  protect him  that bird is your voice  hey ill bring him to work with me  weekends i volunteer at a stray cat rescue  its at the bottom of a coal mine  that was a joke  ii dont i dont work at a coal mine  let the council come to order  today we discuss the set list for sectionals  council  we dont have a director  every year we elect three upperclassmen to lead the group  but dont worry we all get a say  oh fantastic  i have a lot of ideas  warblers if i may  now i cant deny that the warblers vocals  are absolutely dreamy  but i believe our set for sectionals  this year should have a little more showbiz panache  i think we should open with rio by duran duran  uh the council is responsible for song selection  but we appreciate your enthusiasm kurt  itll come in handy one day  when youre sitting behind this desk  now i propose we do our entire set at sectionals  in eightpart harmony  just tell me if its true  im sorry  okay i shouldnt have lied to you  i just thought that if i told you the truth  youd get so mad at me and youre kind of scary  dont you see how its ten times worse now  why her  i mean quinn id understand  but her  do you think shes prettier than me  dont answer that  my dads went to couples counseling because one of them  put up wallpaper in the den without asking the other  and they said it was the only thing that kept them  from killing each other   okay  we need your help  uh thats why i set up this counseling session  youre both in glee  why dont you sing about it  right arent there some great songs  about betrayal or something  im pretty sure theres some eagles songs  right lets do plan b  well start with you finn  why did you lie to rachel  i didnt want to hurt her  then why did you do it with her  why are you so caught up with who it was it doesnt  was it because shes hot  yeah sure shes super hot  but um thats  as a therapist  is it productive for me to slap him right now  well im not a therapist but no  um maybe you should storm out  yeah  is there anything else you want to talk about  what are you doing weve been looking for you all day  im paralyzed with fear  ive been here since second period  i really really have to pee  what are you afraid of  youre gonna be featured at sectionals  you should be happy  i cant handle the pressure  i know im more talented than all of you  britney spears taught me that  its just i cant have whether we win or lose on my shoulders  bbut we all know you can do it  and i know that i cant  just like i know the cricket that reads to me  at night is totally stealing my jewelry  its really too bad i  i cant give you my magic comb  whats a magic comb  youve never heard of a magic comb  mmmm you comb your hair with it  and you cant lose  id give you mine  but i need it  wait  since youre going to dance the lead at sectionals  you win i win  please can i have the magic comb  here  artie thank you so much  you really are the best boyfriend ever  were gonna win this thing  cause of you  all i can say is i didnt steal that soda machine  and if i did i wasnt alone  okay im gonna pretend that i didnt hear that because if i did  id be down to ten glee club members  which as you probably remember from the rule book  is two less than what we need to compete at sectionals  im not big on reading rule books  well im not big on reading  kurts gone and hes not coming back  we need a 12th member  now i always go to rachel and finn in these situations  but you might be the most well known kid in this entire school  theres a method to my madness  i want you to use that madness to recruit a new member  glee needs you to be its ambassador  more like its ambadassador   but whats in it for me  you love the glee club  we get a new member and we win  you get to keep doing what you love  you can count on me mr shue  hey kurt wait up  i saw that glee club was hard for you today  seeing your ideas shot down like that  its just a different energy in there  not better or worse  just something ill have to get used to  we recognize that  and we have a tradition at this school  of rewarding a student with a good attitude  so we would like to invite you to audition for a solo  for sectionals  for sectionals sing something good  all right listen up  are you gonna light your farts on fire again  because im a major fan  i want to talk to you guys  about bruce springsteen  is this going somewhere  dont push me karofsky  you forced my boy kurt out of here  and juvie or no youre already number one  on my list to go all death star on  anyways so bruce is destined to go blue collar his whole life  but instead he goes and buys an old strat from a pawn shop  and just starts wailing on it  starts putting all the pain and the promises and the dreams  into that music and the next thing he knows  hes on the cover of time and newsweek in the same week  those are magazines  not to seem redundant but is this going somewhere  glee club dudes  its time to join up  sign up for glee club  why dont you come to my church on sunday  and get some of my cousins to sign up for the klan  glee club is cool  glee club is most definitely not cool  clearly we need to reinstate the 1000 am slushie  i say we make an example of him  i say youre right  get him get him  not the face not the face  wheres puck i havent seen him since yesterday  and i need him to get me a churro  my guess is hed rather quit glee club than lose sectionals  and i cant blame him  our sets gonna be real light on the mercedes  im telling you if the warblers win sectionals  its only because we gave them kurt  we should not clap  if we lose we should throw possums  rachel what are you doing  im not doing anything  youve silenced my talents im merely protesting  my talents are wasted in this club  my star shines too bright and i think youre threatened by it  take that off  im tired of this rachel  you have a terrible attitude  youre a lousy sport and it is not okay anymore  well im upset  im furious about this  about a couple of things actually  well im sorry youre disappointed  but you know you could also make the choice to be happy  that were a part of a glee club that is  bursting at the seams with talent  theres an awful lot of me talk going around  whats in it for me  what solo am i gonna sing  now when we go to sectionals were gonna be good sports  well cheer on the hipsters  well cheer on kurt and the warblers  and if they win  we will congratulate them  because thats who we are  dude where have you been  i found him in a porta potty  i was trying to find kurts replacement for sectionals  i was trapped in that porta potty for 24 hours  buddha allah satan help me  are you an angel  screw you  so i asked her if she wanted to join  here are my conditions  a carton of cadbury eggs  good luck finding them theyre not in season  and i want seven minutes in heaven  with you  i have to say she kinda rocked my world  okay guys um well looks like were back in business  lets all welcome our newest member  ms lauren zizes  puck nice work  we owe you one  did i tell you he bought me dinner after  you okay  why are you talking to me  are you gonna steal something from me  look after six hours in that portojohn  ozzy himself would have turned to god  i prayed i promised him  that if he got me out of there id start being nicer to people  then i realized there was no way i could do that  so i changed it to just jews  its finn  boyfriend troubles i got that covered  considering im usually the cause of them  id say im an expert  walk with me  have you been working out  your arms seem bigger  its the steroids  we have a big problem  is the problem your outfit  because you look like a cheerleader zombie corpse  i have no choice mike chang likes cheerleaders  you of all people should know  hes having an affair with brittany  what you crazy  you havent noticed her ignoring you lately  not really its shark week  theyre inseparable  theyre doing a number together at sectionals   theyve been rehearsing  really  just rehearsing  exhibit a i kissed him and it tasted like lip smackers  you know who wears lip smackers brittany  and she doesnt mind sharing  i love borrowing her lip smackers  its like candy for your lips  dont be naive artie  shes a cheerleader hes a football player  you and i never had a chance at either of them  hey rachel ive been looking for you  dont bother spying on me to get a leg up  because the only solos that im getting for sectionals are in my mind  actually i was hoping you could help me  ive been sitting in my car for over an hour  waiting for karofsky to make a mickey ds run  ive been invited to audition for a solo  why should i help you i mean youre our competition now  because even though we hate each other  weve had our moments  and i could use your expertise  and no one knows how to kill a ballad quite like you  you are as brilliant and talented as you are irritating  considering that this might be my only chance  to sing for a little while ill give you a couple of tips  so what did you uh have in mind  ive settled on celine dions classic my heart will go on  oh no no no no   no  listen you need something  much more personal than that  i mean this is about you  do you ever fantasize about your own funeral   no  i do  finn throwing himself into the grave out of grief  and all of the heartfelt speeches and the regrets  thats insane  clearly no one in the glee club appreciates me  is it so wrong for me to fantasize about them finally realizing  how amazing i am but it being too late  and theres only one song that expresses those feelings  im sure that its in here somewhere  oh   it wont be easy    youll think it strange    when i try to explain how i feel    that i still need your love    after all that ive done    you wont believe me    all you will see is the girl you once knew    although shes dressed up to the nines    at sixes and sevens with you    i had to let it happen i had to change    couldnt stay all my life down at heel    looking out of the window    staying out of the sun    so i chose freedom    running around trying everything new    but nothing impressed me    at all    i never expected it to    dont cry for me argentina    the truth is    i never left you    all through my wild days    my mad existence    i kept my promise    dont keep your distance    dont cry for me argentina    the truth is i never left you    all through my wild days    my mad existence    i kept my promise    dont keep your distance    have i said too much    theres nothing more i can think of    to say to you    but all you have to do    is look at me to know    that every word    is true   so how many times have you guys auditioned  three  six  hey guys  nick jeff  congrats youre moving on  oh dude  thank you  congratulations thank you  any sage advice  dont try so hard next time  i didnt realize that caring was frowned upon  i dont know how it worked at your old school  but did you notice that we all wear uniforms around here  its about being part of the team  i guess im just used to having to scream to get noticed  youre not going to make it as a warbler  if all you care about is getting noticed  youre right im sorry  i know its going to take some getting used to  but youll fit in soon enough  i promise  hows the number for sectionals coming  hi  um yeah its good  wait do you maybe want to see a movie tonight  uh i cant i have rehearsal with mike  well how about a latte tomorrow morning  artie i cant and i cant talk right now either  i have to go rehearse im really really sorry  hey something wrong  im beginning to think my new directions  for the new directions was a terrible idea  oh no were off to sectionals and i have  ive never seen the kids so out of sync  you look great though  ready to go  i cant  why  i didnt tell carl i was going with you  ever since rocky horror hes had some issues with you  you know with us spending time together  and um actually it was counseling finn and rachel  that made me realize that  sometimes the withholding of the truth  can make someone fellas bad as lying  so i told him the truth last night  and we had a big fight  then we made up and then he told me that he loved me  and then i told him that i love him back  well were going to miss our good luck charm  mr schuester  not that i really care but if we dont leave now  were going to miss the competition  good luck okay  yeah thanks  then go down to  i need raisinets  carb loading  puck got lauren zizes to take your place  and she wont go on unless she gets her damn candy  shes a warm body  hey did you uh get your solo  sadly no  oh wow if you didnt get a solo  then they must be really good  we are doomed  sorry that was selfish  what i meant to say was wow that that really sucks  im im sure you were really good  i was i mean i think i was  being in the warblers has really made me question  everything i thought about myself  yeah  what has become of us kurt  so do you miss us  i do  being a warbler is great  but i dont think they appreciate my individuality  as much as you guys did  and i cant help but think  that i let you guys down  its your life kurt  and you werent safe at mckinley anymore  and we all get it  how come you were never this nice to me  when i was your teammate  because you were my only real competition  hmm yeah true  aw  so hows finn  i feel bad  i havent spoken to him since the wedding  i havent really talked to him much either  i found out that he and santana  were romantically involved and he lied to me about it  wait you didnt know about that  kurt theyre calling places  hey  thanks again rachel   every generation    blames the one before    and all of their frustrations    come beating on your door    i know that im a prisoner    to all my father held so dear    i know that im a hostage    to all his hopes and fears    i just wish i could have told him    in the living years    say it say it say it loud    say it loud    say it clear    say it say it say it    you can listen you can listen    as well as you hear as well as you can hear    hey you got to realize that its true    come on come on say it loud    say it say it say it say it loud    say it clear say    say it   and now for our second performance of the program  from dalton academy in westerville  the warblers   hey    hey    hey    tonight

totally freaking out  last time we performed in front of an audience  i went into labor i think im having  post traumatic stress disorder  fyi im totally available to fill in  nowhere to run  from me or your lies  i hope they judge us on dancing and adultery  because youre aces at both of them  i dont understand how you found out  i am so stupid i cant believe i did it  ive never felt more awful about anything in my life  whats artie all worked up about  you are such a jerk  you told kurt i dont remember maybe  about finn and santana  no i think i told him  who told you  me i think brittany told me  or maybe it was puck yeah it was me  everybody knew about this but me  pretty much nobody tells you anything  because a youre a blabber mouth  and b we all just pretend to like you  thats not true i kind of like her  look rachel when this all happened you were dating  another guy so you dont really have a right to be pissed  at me about it okay  and fine i shouldnt have lied about it  but to be honest that isnt what you care about  you care about the santana of it all  oh who are you right now  best green room ever you know what  you guys are going to have to find somebody else  to mindlessly harmonize  in the background because im not  going onstage with him  make that two subs im not going out there with brittany  me either enough  listen to yourselves  im ashamed of you  think back to where you were this time last year  in this room no set list no choreography  no chance in hell of winning but you did win  because you did it together  look i dont care if you guys hate each other  all i want is for you guys to go out there  and sing together get up there  and for six minutes  remind yourselves that youre not alone  all right show time  just tell me why you would cheat on me  i dont know why would i cheat on you  is this like a mad lib or something  you cheated on me with mike  you admitted it to me in the green room when  when i was accusing you of adultery  what does that have to do with me cheating  adultery means cheating  i thought it meant being stupid  like being a dolt  i didnt cheat on you  i did something much worse  i lost your magic comb  i dont know what happened  i had it in my pocket  and then i went to motocross practice  and then when i left it was gone  thats why ive been avoiding you i was so ashamed  that magic comb  was our only chance of winning the only thing keeping me  from totally screwing it up  i didnt want to let you down artie  that wasnt a magic comb  i just found it on the floor  and ran into you on the way to tossing it in the trash  and you let me comb my hair with it  you dont need a magic comb  youre magic brittany the way you move  and i just should have told you that  in the first place and im sorry  when im out there dancing today  it wont be for the team or for the crowd  it will be for you  what are you doing  im a wrestler  this is how i get psyched up for competition  listen you dont have to
