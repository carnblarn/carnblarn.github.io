regionals  even if hes going to post  a photo like this of me if you do  finn im not going to negotiate with terrorists  if someone posted a picture  like that of me online id probably kill myself  twice to be sure i was dead  look you guys are just going to have to deal with things like this  the more successful you get the more garbage  people are going to make up about you  theyre going to love to tear you down  i cant believe you would do that to me  im going to be married to you  dont you think im going to suffer the consequences as well  i mean i just i dont care about stuff like

ensconced in my uterine wall  my doctor has put me on bovine hormones  that are making me extremely nauseous  theyve also given me a nearsuperhuman sense of smell  for instance i can tell  that within the last week you either enjoyed  a delicious curry or a hug from principal figgins  well you know morning sickness is a good sign  it means that the baby is developing properly  well its good for the baby not so good for me  well you know there really is no cure for morning sickness  i mean i ate saltines  drank herbal tea and sucked on lollipops  that helps  lollipops yeah  weird but it works  well thank you q  for that condescending tone and barely helpful advice  i wanted to ask you a favor actually coach  i would love to rejoin the cheerios  i beg your pardon its my senior year  and i want to finish high school  in a cheerios uniform with a national championship  i mean other than glee  this was the rest of my high school experience  well im sorry q but that wouldnt be fair  to the girls whove been practicing all year long who didnt quit  and if youll now please get the hell out of my office  i just caught a whiff of hot dog water  wafting in from the cafeteria  and i think im going to blow some serious chunks  excuse me  you okay you seemed upset   and if sebastian thinks  forget about sebastian  im not mad at you i just  dont want to waste any more time on him  ii want to focus on winning  ive got a new song i want to try out  the theme for regionals is inspiration  and i think this fits the bill you want to hear it  hey karofsky  whats up nick   lifes too short to

aches for a beat of a drum    whoa whoa    if i could find a way to see this straight    id run away    to some fortune that i    should have found by now    im waiting for this cough syrup    to come down   come down    lifes too short to even care at all    whoa    im coming up now coming up now    out of the blue    oh    these zombies in the park    theyre looking for my heart    whoa whoa    a dark world aches for a splash of the sun    whoa whoa    if i could find a way to see this straight    id run away    to some fortune that i    should have found by now    and so i run now to the things they said could restore me    restore life the way it should be    im waiting for this cough syrup    to come down    one more spoon of cough syrup now    whoa    one more spoon of cough syrup now    whoa    oh   we have to be very careful about how  we deliver the news of this to the student body  david was part of this community  and he still has many friends here  and my understanding is that these teen suicides  or even attempts like davids can induce a string of copycats  its just so senseless  facebook twitter tumblr  the pressure to protect your reputation  is so much worse than when we were kids  yeah and these people can sling their hatred  and their mud anonymously  sue are you crying   hormones  no its not hormones  i could have done more  i was principal when dave was having his trouble  with porcelain and  i knew there was something up with that kid i knew it  all i can think of is his dad finding him  get some help david no buddy come on  david  and that feeling  guys we were all hard on dave  we thought he was going to hurt kurt  i just never thought hed hurt himself   it wasnt our job to know  then whose job was it  we should start todays meeting  by praying for karofsky  that he finds peace and that he feels better  i think we should start todays meeting  by praying for his family  they could use comfort more than he could  i just dont understand how  he could get to such a horrible dark place  its all over facebook  a couple of kids from karofskys new school  saw him at breadstix with kurt on valentines day  they posted mean stuff on his page  and texted everyone that he was gay   he couldnt take it  how is he   is he going to live  well hes in the hospital  but thank god his dad found him in time  i feel sorry for karofsky  but what he did was selfish  he didnt just want to hurt himself he wanted to hurt  everyone around him  i went through the wringer but i never   got to that place  quinn please  sure you had a baby when you were 16  and you had a bad dye job for two weeks  but seriously the world never stopped loving you  and youre going to yale  you have no idea what karofsky was struggling with  you really want to try to compare  the despair the selfloathing  it doesnt matter  i just cant imagine things getting so messedup  that you would consider taking your own life  that is so harsh and reductive  have some compassion  do you know what theyre still writing on his facebook  better luck next time and try try again  why are you even here kurt  thought you didnt believe in god  he asked me if he could come and i invited him  i heard you guys were praying for karofsky and  after everything that weve been through  i didnt have anywhere else to go  i feel responsible  he asked me out and  i said no  and he kept calling me  if id just answered one of those stupid calls  were taking a edible arrangement to the hospital  do you want to come with us  im so sorry  im sorry im really sorry  look ive been thinking about what dave did  and i just want you to know that theres nothing  that anybody could do and theres nothing that anybody could say about me  that would make me want to do that  good cause i dont ever want to be without you  so im not gonna perform at regionals  you have to look i dont care about these pictures  i dont care about what anybody says about me  except for you  lifes too short   what  look i dont want to wait  for some arbitrary date to start living it i  i want to get married  now  i have gym no its saturday  after we win regionals  seriously  yeah awesome  but wait what  what if we lose  well i thought we agreed that i was singing  let me break it down for you from one bitch to another  all this vicious underhanded crap  has got to stop exactly  thats why i called you here  first of all  blaine i am sorry about your eye  that means nothing to me  just give me a chance i have no excuses  other than a lame prank got completely out of control  second the finn photos have all been destroyed  i want the warblers to win fair and square  and were gonna take donations  for lady gagas born this way foundation  win lose or draw  were gonna dedicate our performance to dave karofsky  i thought you might want to join us  wait for the punch you know its coming  no not this time  for too long i have treated everything like a big joke  so how do you get a guy to like you  you get a guy please  why whats wrong with me  first off youre about  quit waxing your eyebrows you look like liberace  in fact just stay in the closet buddy  its all fun and games  until its not  mr shue why do you have a jar of peanut butter with one spoon  yeah there are 15 of us here  and im only comfortable  sharing a spoon with about half of you  well its come to my attention  that our good friend rory flanagan has never tasted peanut butter   what  are you serious   no way  its not possible  rory if you dont mind  oh god  oh my god  thats the best thing ive ever had  mr shuester wow thats incredibly moving  yeah mr shue whats the point of all this  the point is  rory just had a brandnew experience  something as simple as peanut butter  you guys are young  i want you to promise me  that no matter how depressed you get  no matter how hopeless or alone you feel  youll try your best to imagine all of the amazing experiences  you have ahead of you  mr shue look i know were  a little dramatic sometimes but i dont think  anyone will ever consider taking their own life  i did  junior year  that was a tough year  i uh i cheated on my math midterm  peeked at the answers of the guy next to me and  the teacher saw me do it  just cause you got caught cheating  i get caught cheating all the time  they called my dad at his office  and he was coming to pick me up  how was i supposed to look him in the eye  i just kept cturing my dad  so disappointed in me  so i walked up to the roof  i went right to the edge  one step and all the pain and humiliation would be over  is that true  that day i promise you  it felt like it was the end of the world  but you know what  it wasnt  you know for some of you getting caught cheating  isnt a big deal  but theres something  everyone has something  that might take them up to that edge  and look at all the things i wouldve missed out on  i wouldve never met you guys or emma  i wouldve missed out on everything  so right now i want you all to think of something that  youre looking forward to  big things  someday i want to earn  enough money to buy my folks a new place  so they dont ever have to go through  losing their home again  im most looking forward  to meeting rachel berrys children  i want to be there to see my kids first steps  i want to be there to see sex and the city part iii  wow  im sort of embarrassed to admit it  but i really do want to graduate high school  im gonna petition the army to change  my dads dishonorable discharge status to an honorable one  im looking forward to graduating  from yale at the top of my class  im looking forward to the day when my grandmother loves me again  i want lord tubbington to kick his ecstasy addiction  i am looking forward to marriage equality in all 50 states  im looking forward to the first time i dance at carnegie hall  i just want a song  im looking forward to watching my dad make  a difference in congress  im looking forward to being friends with all of you  for the rest of my life  i know this sounds silly  and the peanut butter really is amazing mr shue  but do you know what im looking forward to  winning at regionals  and now lets meet

coming  i know you must be exhausted from singing all those oohs  and background ahs  have a seat  ive been doing a lot of thinking this week  and um i dont know if its this karofsky thing  or even seeing you perform  but i realized something  i always admired you quinn  at first i thought it was because  you reminded me of a younger  somewhat less striking sue sylvester  but then i realized that i admire you  for all the ways youre not like me  you proved that its never too late to turn your life around  and with that in mind  im giving you this  youre not gonna regret this  im gonna win us a national championship in this uniform  hey fabray looking good  thanks boys catch you later  hey  how do i look  coach sylvester gave it to me earlier  and i couldnt resist  well im glad youre happy  everyone deserves to be happy  when you were singing that song  you were singing it to finn and only finn  right  he really does make you so happy  i want to support you rachel and finn  and come to the wedding  if its not too late  can i come in  the doctors took me off   i get to go home tomorrow  thats great  im really happy that youre alive david  me too  i should have returned your calls  why would you after the way ive treated you  its okay no its not  okay  its like you said on valentines day  i made your life a living hell for months  but when the same thing happened to me  i couldnt even take it for a week  i suppose a best friend telling me  he never wants to talk to me again  my mom  telling me that i have a disease  and maybe i can be cured  i dont know what to do  i cant go back to that school  then go to another school  im not gonna lie to you it  it isnt gonna be easy  and therell be some days when  life just sucks  but youre gonna get through this  cause im gonna help you  and so is everyone else who loves you  and accepts you for who you are  and if they cant accept that then  screw em  right  yeah  this week um  mr shue had us think about something  were looking forward to in the future  you want to give it a go  i dont know  come on  ill help you  close your eyes  and imagine what life could be like  in ten years  youre sitting  in a fantastic office  youre some kind of successful professional  a lawyer maybe  could i be a sports agent  sure  youre a big sports agent  living in the city of your dreams  because you left lima and never looked back  your handsome partner comes to visit you in your office  and brings along your son  youre taking the rest of the day off work  because youre taking your son to his first football game  you lean over to your partner and you say  im so happy right now  you uh  you said last week you wanted to be friends  id like that  me too  i believe congratulations are in order  what do you mean  youve never congratulated me about anything  oh i was  in the audience at regionals today  and i thought the glee club  was just fantastic  now you congratulate me  why im pregnant  sue thats incredible  wow thank you  wait what are you doing here  oh i wouldnt miss finn and rachel getting married  im crashing  i think you can win at nationals  and i want to help you  are you serious  im a proven champion  i got some tricks up my sleeve  whats the catch  you know i dont think there is a catch  i think i really just want to help you   isnt that weird  mmhmm  damn hormones  okay could we just have a show of hands  that we all still think this is a crazy idea  okay good that settles it  im pulling the plug  burt calm down calm down carol our kids  are getting hitched we screwed up bigtime  we started playing these crazy  reverse psychology games with them  look where we are the blame game   thisll be fun bring it burt  how did we screw up  by raising two kind  wonderful independentlyminded children  i agree with burt  theyre in love wunderbar but nowhere near ready  for this kind of commitment  at least were here  the truth is if wed come down hard on them  they would have gone behind our back and eloped  trust me i know my son  okay and once he puts his mind to something  there is no getting him off of it  same with rachel at this point even patti lupone herself  couldnt talk her out of marrying finn   barbara could  maybe barbara   whos barbara  streisand  but since babs is probably shopping  in her private underground mall right now  you know she has her own mall  heres what were gonna do  when the justice of the peace   says does anybody here object  hell yeah i do  we will all say we do   with feeling   burt you will run interference with finn  carol you will distract the justice of the peace  with your feminine wiles  i will hustle rachel out the side door  and into our waiting car where you leroy will drive  i dont drive straight to broadway  and if that doesnt start to get our baby girl  back on her career track  i dont know what will are we agreed  sounds like a plan  wow rachel you  you just  you look you do too  ready to go
