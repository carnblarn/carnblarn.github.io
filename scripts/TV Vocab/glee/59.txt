                so heres what you missed on glee  sues pregnant which is crazy  i had my eggs frozen in the late 70s  and she wont say who the father is  but insists that hes famous  rachel and finn decided to get married  after regionals where the new directions  beat sebastian and the warblers and a madrigal group  that just sort of made everyone uncomfortable  and sebastian made up with blaine after he realized  lifes too short to blind people with rock salt  quinn thought rachel and finn were too young to get married  and refused to go to the wedding  which makes me really sad because i would have loved  to have seen you in a bridesmaids dress quinn  but then changed her mind and started texting  while she raced to the courthouse  and her car got hit by a truck  and thats what you missed on glee  so do you think if quinn hadnt gotten into her accident  we still wouldve gone through with the wedding yeah totally  totally i mean im kind of glad were waiting  now it doesnt have to be a justice of the peace quickie  hey i was thinking since nationals  are in chicago this year  wewe should have the wedding someplace special  likelike on the pitchers mound of wrigley field  oor someplace else its not that its quinn  i cant stop thinking about her shes  right behind you  hi quinn we missed you so much  no dont  i could have easily become one of those creepy memorial pages  in the yearbook but by the grace of god im here  believe it or not  this is the happiest day of my life  come on artie ill race you to the choir room  elton johns im still standing begins  you could

mind  im still standing  yeah yeah yeah  im still standing  yeah yeah yeah  once i never could hope to win   you started down the road leaving me again   the threats you made were meant to cut me down   and if our love was just a circus   youd be a clown by now  dont you know im still standing   better than i ever did  looking like a true survivor  feeling like a little kid  im still standing  after all this time  picking up the pieces of my life   without you on my mind  im still standing  yeah yeah yeah  ohohoh  im still standing  yeah yeah yeah im still standing  im still standing im still standing   heres a lesson for your board mr shue  dont text and drive ever  its the stupidest thing ive ever done  besides sleeping with puck  theres a lot of rumors floating around so lets clear the air  first of all all my plumbing still works which is awesome  but my spine was severely compressed in the car accident  which basically means i cant move my feet or legs  but the good thing is that  im starting to regain feeling  so with a lot of physical therapy and your prayers  i stand a good chance for a full recovery  so no tears  that means you tina  oh and i apologize for

question  this saturday the cheerios had regionals tournament  you were 15 minutes late thats unacceptable  i had a doctors appointment  oh i know the doctor had to shine  a flashlight in your vajayjay to get all the bats to fly out  i understand that keeping bats out of your womb  is an important part of having a baby when youre older than god  but it is no way to win a national championship sue  the lovely and talented bronze medalist  roz washington has a point  we need the money and sponsorships that only  a national championship can bring to the school  and your condition is compromising your work  its settled my word is law  this will not stand  oh its gonna stand  and you know what else is gonna stand  your fullygrown adult baby  when he pops out of your birth canal before he hurries off  to the highpowered law firm where he has just made partner  so take your centrum silver and your old ass  and find a new dream  what if i can guarantee you a national championship  and how will you do that  the glee club if they win at nationals  the school wins a 10000 cash prize  i get you that money  i get to run the cheerleading program alone  five six seven

ive ever done  until you go to six flags  look im not trying to be a buzzkill  but going to an amusement park  when youre in a wheelchair  especially if youre still getting used to it  can kind of be a drag  artie its senior ditch day  its the only senior ditch day im ever going to have  i completely agree which is why i want you to come  with me on friday  i promise you  it will be the most amazing incredible and inspiring  ditch day ever  whoo  welcome guys to the cooper anderson acting master class  thank you yes  buckle your seat belts kids buckle your seat belts  cause im about to pour you a tall glass of  this is how it is  first thing youre gonna want to know  dont go to college it is a waste of time  number two  dont go to new york  theater is lame and broadway is dead  real actors do tv and film  which means hollywood is where its at  now lets talk headshots  always without fail turn into a pose  again class wow  and again class ooh  and one more time class oh yeah  yes that is a dynamic headshot and bam  you just got your first callback so now youve got  your sides your foots in the door  what do you do next gotta figure out  is it comedic or is it dramatic  often its hard to tell right  so do what i do ask the director  is this scene comedic or dramatic  he will know youre an actor whos not afraid  to ask the tough questions right  why are you writing this down  okay whats the key to a dramatic scene  finding the emotion  connecting with your scene partner  oh no no and no  the key to a dramatic scene is pointing  when people are really emotional  they point their fingers a lot  thats not true at all  thats thats terrible advice  excuse me guys im sorry im sorry blaine  are you an internationally beloved spokesman  for the internets fastest growing credit score web site  girl no  i didnt think so  so lets focus in okay im here for you  i dont normally do this  but because youre in brothers class and you guys are so nice  im gonna give you some level ii stuff  the secret to great acting  great acting  ignoring whatever the other actor is doing  eye contact with a scene partner is incredibly distracting  i try to tune them out entirely  sometimes i wear earplugs  that way i dont get distracted by what  theyre doing and i can focus on the awesome acting choices  ive planned ahead of time  like eating a roast beef sandwich right  other choices i can plan ahead of time  screaming all my lines  because im really intense  and the things im feeling are really intense  because im an intense actor  nicholas cage right  yeah yeah whoo  bravo  all right guys i dont want you to go craycray  but i brought in sides industry term  from a little show that i auditioned for last week  called ncis  what does that stand for  oh my nana loves that show  now in this scene agent sciuto has just discovered a dead body  who knows what will unfold  dont look at each other action  heres what we know  sergeant pembroke took a bullet  at pointblank range what we dont know  is why hes wearing a dress  theres a rumor that sergeant pembroke was a transvestite  no blaine say the line again  but this time point your finger  things are serious a man in a dress is dead  i dont really feel like pointing coop  just feels a little stupid  well when a choice feels wrong its actually a good sign  it means youre right on the edge man  see i dont know about that i feel like when a choice  coop youre my brother  cant you just support me  im sorry are you talking to me right now  because i cant tell if youre talking to me  if you dont point your finger  right  that is lesson number one guys right  scene scene scene  good work buddy  well get em next time  lets go whoo lets move on  to a little acting exercise that i like to call  the emotion tornado  get your hands up to the sky  just a busted control panel mrs tennison  nothing too serious  youre a lifesaver  noah told me youre going  into business together  no i said we were thinking about it  well i think its a great idea  and if you need any investors  id love to be a silent partner  or a noisy one  in california shes considered ugly  dude im not going to la  okay end of discussion  let me just say this and ill shut up forever  if getting hitched is a team effort  why are you the one thats always giving up everything  maybe its time for rachel to start  thinking about you for a change  its not like youre asking her  to sacrifice her career  you heard blaines famous brother  la is where its at  rachel could probably get on tv  play the quirky nextdoor girl or whatever  and you could try acting too  or go to college this could be your day job  you spend so much time thinking only about her  take a couple seconds and think about yourself    i can barely focus  the thought of a boy clinging to my insides  is making me even more nauseous  sue maybe you should wait to find out the sex of the baby  besides boys arent so bad anyway  theyre disgusting  they have terrible aim when peeing theyre weakminded  and when will someone give me a straight answer  as to why they have nipples  sue sylvester  right this way please  im sorry is this the father  uh no no god no  uh these are these are my friends  mmhmm  sounds so weird coming out of my mouth  here for moral support yes exactly  anything you have to say to me you can say in front of them

directions  hey dude you have a twig in your hair  no seriously  will okay thanks bro  lets give our undivided attention to coach sue  first off please dont ask me which celebrity is the father  of my baby please  i will release that information once ive finalized my book  and movie deal  now it has come to my attention that i have been a tad  harsh with some of you  i thought i was being kind  for instance i said absolutely nothing  about the implausible sexual tension  between mercedes and the kentucky fried stripper  or the sorry fact that you wasted untold millions  on a laser show for yourselves just so sandbags could dance  with the night schools polynesian janitor  actually he was puerto rican  kids its in my dna to be intense okay  just like its in porcelains dna to poop rainbow glitter  now ill admit ii behaved badly  i also realized something  i am here for two very important reasons  number one mr schuester needs at least one adult friend  and number two  i am hoping that the miraculous life growing inside of me  can soak up some of your constantly annoying  though admittedly laudable optimism and decency  now i promise to be nicer  if you promise to work your talented little butts off  until they hand you that firstplace trophy in chicago  all right sloppy babies  lets take it from the top  five six seven eight  hello  im margaret thatcher dog  my relationship with the queen was ruff  oh look what finn won you playing skeeball  finn won this  yeah well rachel kept making him win stuffed animals for her  and at the end of the day out of the 14  she had i confiscated this little guy to give to you  since there was no convincing you coming with us  i wouldve just brought you guys down  look i get it family stuff is hard  especially between brothers  i mean finn and i are not even real brothers  and we pretty much disagree on everything  but i love the big lug  and at the end of the day were in each others corners  you only get one brother blaine  dont give up on that  hes the one thats leaving  huge audition you didnt hear about it  actually he hasnt left yet  hes in the auditorium  hoping that youll come and talk to him  ive tried talking to him  doesnt doesnt really work with him  maybe talking is not the answer  maybe you need to show him  how you really feel in the best most honest way you know how  gotyes somebody that i used to know intro playing  now and then i think of when we were together   like when you said you felt so happy you could die   so when we found that we could not make sense   well you said that we would still be friends   but ill admit that i was glad it was over   but you didnt have to cut me off   make out like it never happened   and that we were nothing  and i dont even need your love   but you treat me like a stranger   and that feels so rough  no you didnt have to stoop so low   have your friends collect your records   and then change your number  guess that i dont need that though   now youre just somebody that i used to know   now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over   but had me believing it was always something that id done   but i dont wanna live that way   reading into every word you say   you said that you could let it go   and i wouldnt catch you hung up   on somebody that you used to know   but you didnt have to cut me off   make out like it never happened   oh and that we were nothing  and i dont even need your love   but you treat me like a stranger   and that feels so rough  oh no you didnt have to stoop so low   have your friends collect your records   oh and then change your number  guess that i dont need that though   now youre just somebody that i used to know   somebody  that i used to know  somebody now youre just somebody that i used to know   somebody  that i used to know  somebody now youre just somedy that i used to know   ooh  i used to know  somebody  best youve ever sounded  i am tough on you  this week maybe a little tougher than i

gonna do it all  movies concerts broadway  even though its dead  youll resurrect it  and when im in the audience watching you  i want to be able to say thats my kid brother up there  i helped him get there  thanks for saying that coop  and i know you really mean it too because  you werent pointing your finger at me or okay okay  speaking really loudly  to be intense  im really glad we could sing together  one last time before you left  to be mr hollywood  actually my audition got canceled  what i dont know apparently michael bay  just decided to go in a different direction  which is industryspeak  for thanks but we found  somebody whos better andor hotter  okay first of all yyou dont know that  and second of all screw optimus prime  even though we dont live in the same town  and
