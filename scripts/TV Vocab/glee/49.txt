                so heres what you missed on glee  mckinleys doing west side story and everyones excited  especially coach beiste and emma and artie  because theyre the directors blaine got the lead  and so did rachel which made mercedes quit the glee club  and join shelbys troubletones with santana and brittany  mike changs playing riff even though his dad told him  he cant be a dancer riff is perfect for you  i think he wants him to go to doctor college or something  and thats what you missed on glee  school bell ringing  artie you see this face this is what enlightenment looks like  it doesnt matter if hes in prison like gandhi  or trapped inside a womans body like chaz bono  or stuck in a wheelchair like me  when a man finds his calling all is right in his world  i still ve performing but thanks to mr shue  and the school musical ive finally discovered  my true passion  bossing everyone around  i mean directing  the key to being a director  is having opinions about everything  no  even stuff you have no id  no i think its great  go  definitely really  thats it no  thats it groans  artie im both sad and happy  that the musical is just days away  tonight begins   tonight tonight    it all began tonight    i saw you and the world went away    tonight tonight theres only you tonight    what you are what you do what you say    today all day i had the feeling    a miracle would happen    i know now i was right    for here you are    and what was just a world is a star    tonight   are you going to cry every time we sing  im such a girl  my only note is more

arent going to inflate themselves  im out of here lets go  look i remember my first time with brittany  the excitement the way it made me feel like a man  even though she called me the wrong name like four times  during and after  what was it like for you guys  um  im im waiting for the right time  yeah yeah meme too  im so glad that youre my tony  look  as your friend i support your strange aversion to fun  but as your director im concerned  im im sorry what do you mean  well how do you expect to convey  the human perience to an audience  when you havent even opened yourself up to one of

this emergency meeting is now in session  now i realize that we are a house divided  but i need the advice of my girls  the last time i called a meeting like thiwas during  our madonna lesson and all of you were wildly unhelpful  but its been two years now and weve all grown up  so im optimistic  finn and i were almost intimate  almost what happened he ran out  i just i wanted my performance of maria  to be as realistic as possible and when he found out that  thats why i was doing it he got really really hurt  of course he was hurt yeah thats really bad rachel  i know i know i feel terribl and now i realize that i was  just doing it for all the wrong reasons  do you want my advice  just wait just wait  look what happened to me you couldve used protection  im not just talking about

that someone soaked in body spray  i lost my virginity at cheerleading camp  he just climbed into my tent alien invasion  okay well then i guess its settled  obviously things are heating up between finn and i  but i think we should wait  losing my virginity was a great experience for me  because i was with someone i love   i have a love    and its all that i have    right or wrong what else    can i do   tina it happened this summer  mike and i had talked about it for awhile  because we knew that the first time was gonna be  something wed want to remember forever   i love him    im his    and everything he is    i am too   and when that moment came  we just knew  it was right  it wasnt rushed  it was amazing  rachel and santana  when love comes so strong    there is no right or wrong

audience murmuring  just so you know your maria has disappointed you  im still a virgin  and your tony has disappointed you   me too  look the audience is smart  the only sensible solution is to just cancel the show  id rather send everybody home than give a false inauthentic performance  five minutes  rachel darken your eyebrows blaine tone down the blush  my eyebrows are fine  artie artie are you okay you look upset  everything is wrong  the scenery the costumes the staging  you know i thought if i just pretended like i knew  what i was doing i could lie my way through it  but in five

like youve grown up  everyones always doing stuff for you  they get freaked out about saying the wrong thing  so they coddle you  sometimes its hard to ever picture a life  of being totally selfsufficient  but directing you ys  the way you trusted me  the way you looked at me and listened to me  it was the first time in my life that i ever  felt like a grown man  thats the greatest gift you can give a guy so  so thank you guys  for the flowers and for everything  all right show circle  relieved laughter  may i chief  lets kick some ass  collective cheer  when i think about how we
