santana sighs what difference does it make  everyone knows that my job here is to look hot  my baby hormones are making me moody  there are so many lyrics  a chain is only as strong as its weakest link  a glee club is about a myriad of voices  coming together as one  all right  this ends now  which is why your assignment for the week  is for each of you to come up with a song  that best represents how you see yourself  where you are in your lives right now  your voice  then  youre going to stand up here and sing your hearts out  all of you  solos  in front of everyone the glee club  has lost its voice  its time for us to get it back  bell ringing  i am going to kill this assignment  if theres one thing that i know its my voice  i have exactly the same vocal range  as 16th century castrato orlando di lasso  but you know what he didnt have  a song by ms whitney houston in his back pocket  hey kurt  dad what are you doing here  is everything okay  oh im here to pick up finn  i got a pair of tickets to the reds game  and carole said that finns never been a major league game  i mean its cincinnati so its barely the major leagues  but still  and why wasnt i invited  chuckles are you kidding me  every time i sit down to watch a game you start in on the fact  that all the players are wearing stirrup pants  because theres never an excuse for stirrup pants  finn okay im ready all right  ill meet you by the car okay  this is gonna be so great  its gonna be great for finn  it means a lot to his mom too  hey ill see you at home ill be home around midnight  bell ringing  girl

miley cyrus the climb  because its about overcoming obstacles and beating the odds  in my case the obstacle is you  my lackluster teammates  who refuse to carry their own weight  gentle intro playing  off key   i can almost see it      that dream im dreaming      but theres a voice inside my head saying      youll never reach it    voice cracking   every step im taking      every move i make feels lost with no direction      my faith is shaking      but i gotta keep trying      gotta keep my head held high    will rachel  i think youve lost your voice  ell ringing      hey ladyface  i noticed you werent at cheerios practice yesterday  and i dont look kindly on absenteeism  im so sorry ms sylvester  it wont happen again  something happened yesterday that really upset me  its my dad  hes the most important thing in the world to me  i love him  and im afraid that i might be losing him  because of my sexuality  your sexuality  how old are you 16  have you even kissed a boy  no  have you ever kissed a girl no  well then how can you possibly know what you like  you see thats the problem with your generation  youre obsessed with labels  so you like show tunes  doesnt mean youre gay  it just means youre awful  you know theres only  one person in this world who can tell you what you are  me  no me sue sylvester  and she hasnt quite made up her mind about you  wait i have an idea  our assignment for glee club is to find a song  that reflects our voice  yeah you know what i checked out  of this conversation about a minute back  so uh good luck with your troubles  and im gonna make a habit  not to stop and talk to students  cause this has been a colossal waste of my time  hey kurt  you want to speak me  hey dad yeah i was just uh  working on my glee club assignment  pink houses by john mellencamp  oh really  i didnt think that was in your wheelhouse  yeah i think its really brave for a midwesterner like himself  to uh write a song about such bold interior design  you know thats not what the songs about  really  no its about how the 80s were a tough time for a lot of people  and how the american dream isnt all its cracked up to be  hmm  fascinating  hey why dont we go grab  a couple burgers and uh you can tell me  more about it sure  but i gotta be honest  thats pretty much what every mellencamp song is about  but you know what ill get my coat  anything to help you out  what if he says ill never sing again  i mean who am i without my voice  im just this spoiled annoying only child  dont say that  theres like so many awesome things about you  like  look hes not gonna say youll never sing again  bad news rachel youll probably never sing again  im kidding you have severe tonsillitis  which has resulted in an inner ear infection  from the looks of things its not the first time  you should have had them out years ago why should i let you  butcher my throat when just resting my voice for a week  and chugging down herbal tea will do the same job  this is a very serious infection  i think shes worried  about the surgery affecting her singing voice  doctor at least start by taking  these antibiotics  unless you think theyre going  to adversely affect your dance moves  sighs  what do you think i should do  maybe you should ask your boyfriend  oh wait you cant hes not here  hes in san diego on spring break  with his friends from vocal adrenaline  when are you gonna realize that  hes not into you like i am  you think hes gonna stick around if you cant sing  if youre a vocal cripple  look i know that youve always been jealous of jessie  and even though he and i havent spoken  since the run joey run debacle  you just have to accept the fact  that i still care about him deeply  and i know he still feels the same way about me  guitar plays rock riff    jessie is a friend      you know hes been a good friend of mine      but lately somethings changed      and that aint hard to define      jessies got himself a girl and i want to make her mine      and shes watching him with those eyes      and shes loving him with that body i just know it      and hes holding her in his arms late late at night      you know i wish that i had jessies girl      i wish that i had jessies girl      where can i find a woman like that      and im lookin in the mirror all the time      wondering what she dont see in me      ive been funny ive been cool with

at least if you guys are dating  i wont have to spend so much time listening  to his insane theories  on how super mario brothers changed civilization  but you do realize  hes using you and your popularity  so he wont get tossed in a dumpster  i know hes using me  but in a way its even better  im not you  ive never had a guy like me for anything but now  im such a steaming mug of hot chocolate  that one of the studliest guys in school wants  to use me to harvest some mojo  i just dont want you getting hurt  i know what this is  my hearts safe  oh im not worried about your heart  i

pink houses for you and me      oh baby for you and me    song ends  weak applause  is there something wrong mr shue  i dont really think you got the point of the assignment  this was about finding a song  that expresses who you are  that song didnt really sound like you  well im sorry if i didnt live up to your expectations  no no this group needs you to be you kurt  you can literally do things that no one else can  im not a box  there are more than four sides to me  dont lose track of who you are  just because it might be a easier to be somebody else  all right take five guys  hey kurt  that song was hot  oh  with a twang merci  so youre pretty much the only guy in this school  that i havent made out with  because i thought you were capitalg gay  but now that youre not  having a perfect record would mean a lot to me  so let me know if you want to tap this  bell ringing  are you like sleepwalking  you have to be able to sleep to sleepwalk  i am on my third day of antibiotics

maybe  what happened to the hoagies  ah blew it off  you know too much cholesterol  i bet finn was disappointed  he understood uh  once i told him how bent out of shape i thought you were  me im fine  kurt im dumb but im not stupid  and i have no idea  what that song was about  but fine dont sing like you just sung  look  maybe i got carried away doing stuff with finn  but i told you this thing with you was going to be hard  thing with me  you mean being gay  yeah  being gay  look i will fight to the death  for your right to love whoever you want  but when you were a little baby in my arms  did i dream about taking you to baseball games  and talking about girls  yeah i did  a lot of fathers do  i had no idea how disappointing i was  hey come on now stop it right now  imim talking straight to you  dont go playing the victim  you know thats not what i mean  crying i know  im sorry  i know youre working hard on yourself  to make all this okay  just seeing you  the way you are with finn  how easy it is  voice breaks it breaks my heart  is that why you were pretending to date that daffy cheerleader  and dressing differently and singing mellencamp  i just want you to know that  im going to work as hard as you to make this okay  you dont have to work at anything kurt  your job  is to be yourself  and my job is to love you  no matter what  okay that and a majority ownership  in a tire store thats all we got  okay we stick to that were going to be great  i missed you dad  oh come here  i love you  love you too  mom  finn with you  no i came by myself  is that okay  yeah  i um i just  wanted to say thank you  and for showing me that  just because im not good  at anything other than singing doesnt mean  im not any good if i cant sing  that sounded like a really bad greeting card  no it was cool  well anyways i  i just thought i could maybe return the favor  i thought i could give you singing lessons  it sort of seemed like an area of interest for you  illill come by  like once a week or something and we could just  see how it goes  iveive helped almost everyone in our glee club  some by brute force but  so your voice came back  turns out that a heroic dose of antibiotics  and a mysterious blend of herbal remedies  and a vow of silence is all it takes  to cure tonsillitis so  ill probably have  to have my tonsils taken out eventually but um  imim not scared anymore  laughs softly  uh so  do you want to give it a spin now  sing with you  yeah  yeah id be honored  come here  take my hand  can you feel that  no  but its weird  i remember what it feels like  and i can see it so  its like i can  ii um  clears throat  i thought wed do a little  classic rock today  finn said you might like that  yeah    is it getting better      or do you feel the same      will it make it easier on you now      you got someone to blame    both   you say    sean   one love one life      when its one need in the night      one love we get to share it      leaves you baby if you dont care for it      did i disappoint you      or leave a bad taste in your mouth      you act like you never had love      and you want me to go without    both   well its too late      tonight      to drag the past out into the light      were one but were not the same      we get to carry each other carry each other      one      yeah yeah yeah    harmonizing   one      one    all   love is a temple love is a higher law      love is a temple      love is a higher law      you ask for me to enter but then you make me crawl    all   and i cant be holding on to what
