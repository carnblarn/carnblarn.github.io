                hat you missed on glee artie made the football  team which is crazy and finns not the quarterback  anymore this new kid sam is can you believe it kurts dad  and finns mom are dating and are really happy together  which makes finn and kurt sort of like brothers  they sure yell at each other like brothers  why is it so hard for you to understand  sue has a sister jean who she doesnt yell at at all  i will always love you  which sort of makes her the only person  sue doesnt yell at and thats what you missed on glee  finn it all started a week ago  i was super hungry but my mom was gone  so i busted out the george foreman  it wasnt making the cool grill marks it used to after  i tried to use it to dry my shoes  but when it comes to grilled cheese  im not that fancy  and when i pulled the sandwich out  i saw the face of god  literally  i had made a grilled cheesus  im so hungry im not the most religious guy  i sort of worship eric clapton and ochocinco  but this was different so  i decided to see what it felt like to you know pray  dear grilled cheesus  first of all youre super delicious  please grilled cheesus  please let us win our first football game  it would mean so much to artie  and i think you kind of owe it to him  i mean you did sort of screw him in the leg department  and in return cheesy lord  ill make sure we honor you this week in glee club  crowd roaring players grunting  whistle blowing  cheering  thank you grilled cheesus   hey dad hey thats my boy  you forgot your breakfast  suzanne somers says that skipping breakfast is suicide  what is this  its an egg white wrap on a sprouted wheat tortilla  half a grapefruit and a green drink  wheres my usual breakfast  a coke and two slim jims  yeah breakfast of champions  dad you are not a kid anymore  you have to start taking care of yourself  well i guess with enough hot sauce  this will  all right thanks  hey dont forget friday night dinner is 600  instead of 700 this week  carole and finn are coming over  and she has to work the night shift  ii cant do this friday  its singalong sound of music at the el royale theater  its a onceayear event  and last week you had to camp out early  so you could be first in line for those greys anatomy dvds  season six dad  okay those friday night dinners are a ritual  in our family one your mom started  i know but im a teenager  friday nights are kind of important to me  why are you making me feel guilty about this  i of all people know how important  the relationship is between you and carole  those dinners are more than important  theyre sacred okay the whole point  of having something sacred is that it takes precedence  over anything else you got going on  singalong sound of music is sacred to me  what you think i dont know that  okay wasnt i the one who bought you  that maria bonnet when you were six  okay the point is  if you start giving up stuff like friday night dinners  then you got nothing to hold onto  okay lets face it kurt  if we dont schedule it then we dont hang out  if we dont hang out then our lives  they just go right by each other  and we dont share very much  im sorry but im not missing something that i look forward to  all year just for another dinner  maybe we could do it thursday or something  i got to tell you kurt  im real disappointed in you  school bell ringing  mr shue  i have something to say  something happened to me  and i cant really get into it but its shaken me to my core  oh my god hes coming out  why yes  there is a man whos sort of recently come into my life and  that man is jesus christ  thats way worse  and i know theres others  in here who dig him too  and so i thought maybe this week  we could pay tribute to him in music  you know pay tribute to jesus  sorry uh but if i wanted to sing  about jesus id go to church  and the reason i dont go to church is because  most churches dont think very much of gay people  or women or science  i dont see anything wrong with getting a little church  up in here i agree  ive had a really hard year  and i turned to god a lot for help  i for one wouldnt mind saying thanks  thanks for what that it didnt come out a lizard baby  whenever i pray i fall asleep  well guys maybe our song selections  dont have to be about jesus  we could do songs about spirituality  you got a problem with jesus  oh i got no problem with the guy  im a total jew for jesus  hes my number one heb  what i dont like seeing is people using jmoney  to cramp everybody elses style cause it seems  to me that true spirituality or whatever you want to call it  is about enjoying the life that youve been given  i mean i see god every time i make out with a new chick  rachel okay okay that doesnt make  any sense in fact its stupid  are you calling mr billy joel stupid  at this time id like to continue my streak  of doing only songs by jewish artists  hit it  intro to only the good die young begins  come out virginia dont let me wait   you catholic girls start much too late   oh but sooner or later it comes down to fate   i might as well be the one   well they showed you a statue told you to pray   they built you a temple and locked you away   oh but they never told you the price that youd pay   for things that you might have done   only the good die young   whoaoh whoaoh whoa whoa oh   you got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation   you got a brandnew soul   mmm and a cross of gold   come out come out come out   virginia dont let me wait   you catholic girls start much too late   but sooner or later it comes down to f fate   i might as well be the one   you know that only the good die young   tell ya baby   song ends  oh  cheering  well according to this ive still got two left but  let me check cause i dont trust the guy  who does my inventory  whos that me  oh oh geez  oh  oh  hey you okay man  yeah just a little indigestion you know  dont buy salami at the gas station laughs  speaking french  kurt  can we talk to you outside  where is he  is he dead  no hes alive but im sorry  i dont have any other good news  i want to see him he hasnt regained consciousness  will i thought he had a heart attack  brought on by an arrhythmia  which caused a lack of blood to his brain  thats what made him lose consciousness  and whats keeping him comatose  we have him on lidocaine  but theres no guarantees theyre going to work  or what kind of damage was done  to his brain by the lack of oxygen  i dont understand what youre saying  when is he going to wake up  i dont know  okay justjust just take us to him now please  monitor beeping  i need a minute  i dont think you should be alone kurt  please just give me a moment alone with my father  well be right outside  dad  can you hear me  if you can hear me  squeeze my hand  im holding yours right now  just squee back  come on dad  just squeeze my nd  what up grilled cheesus  i need to ask you for something  i didnt go to sunday school so i dont know  if god works the same as a genie and i only get three wishes  but heres the thing  dating rachel is great  but shes kind of a prude and im sort of going crazy  anyway her boobs arent that great  but theyre still girl boobs  and id really like to touch them  so cheesus  considering that ive dedicated a week  of my musical life to you  i hope you can see it in your heart  to answer my prayers  amen  school bell ringing  santana hey kurt  were really sorry about your dads heart attack  thanks santana  i did a book report on heart attacks  if you want to give it to the doctor  i got knocked down an entire letter grade  cause it was written in crayon  what the hell happened  my dads in the hospital i know  my mom just called me i feel like im the last one to know  well im sorry finn it didnt occur to me  to call you because hes not your father  yeah well hes the closest im ever going to get okay  i know it may not look like what everybody else has  but i thought we were sort of a family  look ii guess i just  i didnt like overhearing  other people talking about it in gym class  hey guys  our thoughts are all with kurt and uh  i know its sort of hard to really focus on anything else  mercedes mr shue  yeah ive been struggling trying  to figure out what i wanted to say to kurt  all day and i realize  i dont want to say it i want to sing it  this song is about being in a very dark place  and turning to god  its a spiritual song mr shue  is that okay its fine  tina quinn can you help me out please  intro plays to i look to you  as i lay me down   heaven hear me now   im lost without a cause   after giving it my all   winter storms have come   and darkened my sun   after all that ive been through   who on earth can i turn to   i look to you   i look to you   after all my strength is gone   in you i can be strong   i look to you   i look to you oh   and when melodies are gone   yeah  melodies are gone   in you i hear a song   i look to you   ooh   i look  music fades  to you   applause  sighs thank you  mercedes  your voice is stunning but  i dont believe in god  wait what  youve all professed your beliefs  im just stating mine  i think god is kind of like santa claus for adults  otherwise  gods kind of a jerk  isnt he  i mean he makes me gay and then  has his followers going around telling me its something that i chose  as if someone would choose to be mocked  every single day of their life  and right now  i dont want a heavenly father  i want my real one back  but kurt how do you know for sure  i mean you cant prove that theres no god  you cant prove that there isnt a magic teapot  floating around on the dark side of the moon  with a dwarf inside of it  that reads romance novels and shoots lightning  out of its boobs but it seems pretty unlikely doesnt it  is god an evil dwarf  we shouldnt be talking like this  its not right  im sorry quinn  but you all can believe whatever you want to  but i cant believe something i dont  i appreciate your thoughts  but i dont want your prayers  will how did you even find out about the lesson  i have cameras everywhere william  im ving a lesson on spirituality  i dont understand what the big deal is  well the big deal is that this is a public school  and theres this little thing  called separation of church and state  which happens to be the pillar  of a functioning civil society  but sue children should be  allowed to profess whatever faith they choose  at the bet awards but not in a public school  sue im trying to help these kids  kurt is struggling with some really tough issues  well william if your kids want to praise jesus in class  i suggest they enroll at sweet holy mother of god academy  on i love jesus street  but not here  this country is not a monarchy william  trust me ive tried  and as much as i enjoy giving impromptu civics lessons  i got work to do  finn please sit  youre upset about kurts dad too  yes  but more importantly lets discuss  your newfound love for jesus and how its affecting me  i want this relationship  to go the distance  but i need to know that when im 25 and ive won  a bunch of tonys and im ready  to have intercourse and babies that those babies will  be raised in a certain way you dont think  youre gonna have sex till youre 25  i want my children to be raised in the jewish faith  both of my dads peoples were slaves once  i need to know that my children will be free to worship  in the way that i decide is right  sure of course  yeah they should totally go to jew church and  and wear those hats and  and eat that salty orange stuff with their bagels  lets lay down on the bed  okay  whispers finn  id like to give you something  in exchange for what you gave me    whispers thank you grilled cheesus  i need to know whats going on with that glee club  brittany jugs the clown go  mostly just everyones really sad  for kurt and no one really knows how to help  i made him a card that said heart attacks  are just from loving too much  schuesters still pushing  the lil jeezy i guess so  although i dont really see what the big deal is  but kurts definitely not into it  hows your father  they say his condition is critical  but stable  good news i guess  im sorry for what youre going through lady  i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy  and i guess i dont have to i think mary lou rettons  like an orphan or something  i dont like  what schuesters doing in that classroom  even more than usual  but i cant go to the school board  without an official complaint from a student  so you want me to be your scapegoat  quietly no  you dont understand  i know at times i mess around with you guys for fun  i admit it it aids digestion  but im not joking here  i want to be your champion  what is wrong with you  im sorry madame secretary  im gonna have to call you back  love to bill  there is a boy in that glee club  that might lose his father  how could you get in the way when the only thing  anybody is trying to do is give that poor child  just a little bit of comfort  what happened  to you sue  please tell me what horrible horrible thing  happened to you that made you such a miserable tyrant  have a seat  since i was a little girl  ive had exactly  one hero  my big sister  you know how much i worshipped her  she was the sun and the moon to me  and while i was still very young  i noticed that other people didnt feel the way i did  people were rude to her  they were cruel  they laughed at her  and so i began to pray  i prayed every night for her to get better  and nothing changed  so i prayed harder  and after a while i realized it wasnt that i wasnt praying  hard enough  its that no one was listening  asking someone to believe in a fantasy  however comforting isnt a moral thing to do  its cruel  dont you think thats just a little bit arrogant  its as arrogant as telling someone how to believe in god  and if they dont accept it no matter how openhearted  or honest their dissent theyre going to hell  well that doesnt sound very christian does it  well if thats what you believe thats fine  but please keep it to yourself  so long as you do the same  that kid could lose his father at any moment  you should start preparing him for that  now get the hell out of my office  i realize youre only half orangutan  but im still very allergi to your lustrous ginger mane  last week we were too sexy this week were too religious  we cant win now i know what miley feels like  the real tragedy here is that i found  the most perfect spiritual song to sing this week  and now its been torn away from me like sophies daughter  guys you can still sing whatever songs you like  that sum up your feelings about god about spirit  you just cant do it on school time  i hope youre happy kurt  having the week of my life actually  guys back off kurt okay  he had every right to speak his mind  look kurt were sympathetic to what youre going through  but siding with miss sylvester isnt gonna do anyone any good  its doing me some good  now i dont have to sit around  listening to all you mental patients  talk about hows theres a god when i know there isnt one  school bell rings  cheesus i dont need to tell you how much you rule  youve given me everything ive prayed for  and it turns out rachels boobs are really awesome  anyway i need another favor so cheesus  i pray that im made quarterback

but im bummed about kurts dad  ive kind of been praying for him  i know how hard it is  not to have a father you know  what do you pray for  yeah same stuff  you burned your grilled cheese  slaps arm winces  why are we in the park cause i dont  want anything coming between us and god  and because yentl was outside when  she sang this song in the movie  i just hope that god hears this song as a prayer for burt hummel  and decides to bring him back to us  gentle intro plays  god   our heavenly father  oh god   and my father o is also in heaven  may the light   of this flickering candle

funeral  when they were lowering her body into the ground i was crying  i mean that was it  it was the last time i was ever going to see her  and i remember i looked up at my dad  and i i just wanted him to say something  just something to make me feel like my whole world wasnt over  and he just took my hand and squeezed it  and just knowing that those hands were there  to take care of me that was enough  this is for my dad  yeah ill   string section fading up tell you something   i think youll understand   when i say   that something   i want to hold   your hand   i want to hold   your hand   i want to hold your hand   oh please   say to me   youll let me be your man   and please   say to me   youll let me hold   your hand   now let me hold   your hand   i want to hold   your hand   and

really scary time right now  but i feel like i dont know how to be around you anymore  and i know youre not really spiritual or whatever  but i feel like youre closing yourself to a world  of experiences that might surprise you  youre right  im sorry  i shouldnt be pushing my friends away  especially friends as fabulous as you  do me a favor one thing  come to church with me this sunday  our church does this thing  where we dedicate the service to someone  and i got them to dedicate this sunday to your dad  i dont know you get to wear  a fabulous hat  mercedes you had me at fabulous hat  laughs  come on lets go to class  school bell ringing  i have to confess something  im the reason sam got hurt  i asked for three things to happen  one for us to win our first football game  two to get to second base with rachel and three  to be the quarterback on the football team again  all those three things happened because i prayed for them  to grilled cheesus  okay  where to start no no i know it sounds crazy but it isnt  jesus appeared to me on a sandwich  and it has special powers im telling you  but i didnt mean for anybody to get hurt  okay lets just lets take a second  okay um  look first you won the football game  because you actually have a coach  who spends the game watching the plays  rather than biting his toenails  and god didnt let you touch rachels boobs  rachel did  just the sides of them but wait why would she do that  well what were you doing right before you were touching them  what i remember yawning  right cause we were talking about emotional stuff  oh yes well there you go thats it  girls like that  she felt close to you thus the inappropriate touching  uh more importantly you didnt hurt sam  it was a 300pound left tackle who just got expelled  because hes on steroids and hes 23  god works in all kinds of mysterious ways  but im pretty sure he doesnt spend a lot of time  trying to speak to us through sandwiches  you look disappointed  i am  it was sort of cool  feeling like i had this direct line to god  now i just feel  like everybody else you know  like were all just floating around in space  i dont like that  youre not alone  the big questions are really big for a reason  theyre hard  but you know what  absolutely everybody struggles with them  losing my religion begins  oh   life is bigger   its bigger than you and you are not me   the lengths that i will go to   the distance in your eyes   ive said enough   thats me in the corner   thats me in the spotlight   losing my religion   trying to keep up with you   and i dont know if i can do it   oh no ive said too much   i havent said enough   i thought that i heard you laughing   i thought that i heard you sing   i think i thought i saw you try   but that was just a dream   just a dream just a dream   dream   song ends  i thought we couldnt sing songs about religion  evidently we cant sing about faith  but we can sing about losing faith  thats sort of what i want to talk about today  well earlier in the week finn  it seemed like you felt differently  well i used to think god was up there looking over me  now im not so sure  organ plays  im very impressed with everyones sunday best  its so christchic  i hope our genuflection to the great  spaghetti monster in the sky dont take too long  my sikh is coming again today at 200  to do more acupuncture on my dad  is it working  not yet  nothing is  i have to go be with my choir  mutters wait dont dont  hi church  all hi  i have a favor to ask you guys  my friend kurt hummels dad is in the hospital  and its pretty bad  and i know we have all of our own worries and troubles  but if we could just put them aside  and focus all of our prayers and give them to burt hummel  and to my friend kurt  i know you dont believe in god and you dont believe  in the power of prayer and thats okay  to each his own  but youve got to believe  in something  something more than you can touch taste or see  cause life is too hard to go through it alone  without something to hold onto  and without something thats sacred  anyway kurt this song is for you  organ plays intro  dont trouble the water   give it up why dont you   whoa whoa yeah  whoa yeah   when youre down and out   when youre in the street   when evenin falls so hard   i will comfort you   ill take your part   ooh ooh   yeah   oh when darkness comes  ooh ooh ooh   and theres no one   no one you love around   just like a bridge over troubled waters   i will lay me down   like a bridge   like a bridge   over troubled water  over troubled water   i will lay me down   dont trouble the water   yeah yeah   give it up   give it up yeah  why dont you   let it be  let it let it let it let it   let it let it let it be yeah  still waters run deep   hey hey  yes they do   oh yeah yeah  oh yeah   dont trouble the water  trouble   ill be there when you need a friend   to lay me down  why dont you why dont you let it be   ill be your bridge over troubled water   hey hey yeah  still waters run deep   yes they do   yes they do  dont trouble the   trouble the water  water   applause and cheering  no this one baby oh this one  yeah  boom boom i

cant do that  kurt you never could dress yourself  monitor beeping  mercedes took me to church on sunday  its funny but when the choir was singing  this memory flashed into my head  do you remember our first friday night dinner after mom died  you tried to make a chicken  i guess you wanted me to feel  like there was something still normal  you put it on the table  and you cut into it and it was raw  laughs and we both looked at each other for a second  and cracked up before we remembered  that we werent supposed to yet  im sorry about the other day dad  i should have let those guys pray for you  it wasnt about me  it was about you and it was nice  monitor beeping  i dont believe in god dad  but i believe in you  and i believe in us  you and me  thats whats sacred to me  and i am  im so sorry that i never got to tell you that  sniffles and sobs  dad  nurse nancy  dad im right here  im not going anywhere  one of us begins  if god had a name what it would it be   and would you call it

what if god was one of us   one of us   was one of us   oh just a slob like one of us   just a slob like one of us   just a stranger on the bus   trying to make his way home   trying to make his way
