morning sue  oh im gonna stop you right there  thats principal sue  what  oh you heard me right  my yearslong quest for power  has finally bore fruit  wait what happened to figgins  well you need to start listening to the news william  a particularly virulent strain of monkey flu  has arrived in ohio from borneo where it had been festering  in a small clutch of loud bisexual primates  not unlike your very glee club  how how did figgins get it  and thats what it means to be an american  i think i have a fever can it  now  sup  so figgins is sick  how does that make you principal  well through

usurping me  you kids love me  sue doesnt  you know whats so nice  is having someone fun at this school  mm were back okay  oh hoarders is great but  animal hoarders is better  hoarders and red wine   im buzzed   you have to get well mr schuester  because every day youre here shes there  and it becomes more and more likely  that shes going to start running the glee club  and youre going to become the substitute  oh we have to get there early on friday  its league night for little people  and theyll buy up all the small shoes if they get there first  oh i totally forgot  greg evigan is starring

idol richard millhouse nixon  regarded in his time as petty corrupt and venal  he actually always had the best interests of his people in mind  and also like richard nixon im obliged to inform you  that this conversation is being recorded  i want my tots  nutrition is abysmal at this school  you know what this is  toilet brush its broccoli  when i showed this to brittany earlier she began to whimper  thinking i had cut down a small tree where a family of gummy bears lived  i am declaring a war on junk food  im getting my tots back  becky that cant happen again  keep em out  roger that thank you coach   hey rachel  hello miss holliday  id like you to know  that i have a very severe bruise on my right buttocks  from your game of gangsta rap musical chairs  ill be going on record with

class later  it is so boring in there  thanks miss h  righteous  you know what maybe i should be more like you  all fun and just forget about the consequences  well frankly yes you should  i mean at least sometimes  when was the last time that you did something  just because you thought it would be a blast  take glee club  i mean you have all these great ideas  when is the last time you actually did one of them  mr shue can be a little tightfisted with song selection but  i would like to do something a little bit more upbeat  and glamorous with a good dance beat  sounds reasonable to me have you asked  mr shuster i want to do more of an upbeat  glamorous song with a really good dance beat  no but i have good news  i found a journey song we havent done yet  rachel i used to be just like you  trying to get everything so right hanging on so tight  what happened  i got punched in the face anyway  why dont you let me know the name  of this upbeat glamorous song with the nice dance beat  because hot stuff you are doing it in glee club  i kind of need a partner to do the song i wanted  i thought youd never ask  thats kind of my catch phrase  so  what meds are you on  um antidepressants and antianxiety when i need them  are you happy  you know i think i feel like  for the first time maybe i could be happy  how about you  happy yeah  if im gonna be honest  no  i still feel like im

brought tots  better ive set you up on a date  i get it  my new budding friendship with blaine  is making you feel left out  jealous whos the guy  anthony rashad  why him  no reason  oh so it has nothing to do with the fact that hes one of  the five black guys at this school  uh no he is a wide receiver on the football team  he is very goodlooking  and he is a member of the black student union  any nonblack activities  i dont know my google search was a little  i cant take this anymore  mercedes trust me love is just  around the corner whats up homo  thats not what im talking about  tots  oh my god  tots tots tots  tots tots tots  tots tots  tots tots tots tots tots tots  so the tot wars have begun becky   you can like   the life youre living   you can live   the life you like   you

theres no reason for you to be here  the kids prefer the substitute and so do i  i got to be honest with you will  a lot of its the hair thing  in fact right now im tempted to sell your scalp  on the black market as a tiny fulllength shearling coat  for only the most fashionable of premature babies  oh i long for the day  when figgins gets better and comes back  well thats not gonna happen  the school board has been just flooded  with emails from parents thrilled with my tough stance  on healthy teen lunches  figgins has been fired  and ive been formally offered the position  so why dont you go home  rest watch some tv die  it doesnt matter cause you know what  as my first official act as fulltime principal  you are fired  drunk people who get married to someone just saying that  they met an hour ago by an elvis impersonator  i mean thats the bigger insult to marriage  than two gay guys getting hitched totally its like  if marriage is so sacred they should just outlaw divorce  right right right  what do you think mercedes  oh about uh dont ask dont tell  no were on prop 8 now  totally for it  against it  right  im sorry i kind of just blanked out  oh dont apologize we should talk

meet like this  the kids really love you you must be a great teacher  you dont believe that if you did  you wouldnt have taken my job so easily  guys you want to take five  okay you want to have this conversation lets have it  youre a substitute of course you can  paint murals and let the kids sing whatever they want  youre never around when they have to deal  with the hangover of all that fun  students dropped out last year  we cant just expect them to sit up and pay attention  these kids feel special  they have a voice and if we dont listen to it  they just tune us out  i give my kids a voice  i just dont let it run free  im the teacher its my job to know  more than they do right but you dont know more  about what they care about the most themselves  these kids get bored  they change their facebook status  theyre entitled to have all of these emotions  and not only that theyre entitled  for the world to care about them  thats what this generation is about  a great teacher is supposed to show them that  there are other points of view besides their own  okay fine what do you do when  a kid does something really great in your class  praise them i tweet them about it right there and then  and for those 30 seconds i know that that kid has a connection  with me  look its a terrible economy  and good teaching jobs are hard enough to get  let alone one in the arts  i just  im sorry but i i cant turn this opportunity down  you want to tell ms holliday why were here  remember when i asked to be excused from class  may i be excused im gonna go shove some tots  up the tailpipe of coach sylvesters car  sure  i told her not to touch my tots  you did 17000 worth of damage  i drive a very rare and desirable automobile ladies  prized by collectors for its peerless grace  among vintage european sports cars  one out of seven in existence  the 1979 lecar  you know how many hours it took  to find a mechanic who even knew what a lecar was  shes your student  i would love to hear what you suggest as punishment  i was gonna suggest clapping erasers  but you guys are mostly dryerase here so  you know what you might not find so funny mercedes  is that tampering with an automobiles exhaust  is a felony  and you can rest assured that i  and my attorney gloria allred will be pressing charges  so  am i going to jail or  undetermined great  get the hell out of my office  you have absolutely no idea what youre doing do you  no not really  by the way berets are out  sorry for just coming over like this  i wanted to do this in person  plus i heard you have expensive beer

more like you  spaulding high school ten years ago  good morning class  i was subbing for a math teacher  the syllabus says that youre on algorithms  so lets start with some easy ones  lets start with you kissing my ass  her name was cameo  she was like an attractive biggie smalls  okay miss cameo  miss cameo do you find that algorithms  are hard for you to understand  do you find my fist hard to understand  i have some really great tricks  that make them very easy to learn  tricks what are you some type of magician substitute  im a christian  and that devil magic stuff  offends me  cameo  i woke up in an empty classroom  theyd stolen my air jordans  from that moment i realized i got to keep things moving  i got to keep it mellow and fun  yeah to keep from getting your butt kicked  and i do in all ways  i never sign more than a monthtomonth lease  i only eat off paper plates  i live on onenight stands  last year a guy  asked me to marry him i moved  sounds lonely  yeah  well it works

heart was racing  are you out of your mind  after what you did to sues lecar  youre gonna end up in prison  so you know what they have in prison  tots  im not breaking it off with blaine  i really like him  you are substituting food for love mercedes  and more importantly  youre substituting me for a boyfriend  look at me two weeks ago  i thought there was no way id ever find someone like blaine  and there he was  you will find somebody  but until then  you just got to take care of yourself  and treat yourself with a little respect  youre right  i got to go  where  im gonna go talk to that anthony kid  first time i saw him i thought he was kind of cute  maybe we have a shot  question for you  you tell anyone else what happened  how youyou kissed me  you kissed me karofsky and i understand  how hard this is for you to deal with  so no i havent told anyone  good you keep it that way  cause if you do  im gonna kill you  is is where i grovel to try to get my job back  no groveling necessary william  im returning you to your position  you know one of the marks of a successful leader  is appointing trusted lieutenants  and ms holliday was clearly not up to the job  you irritate me william  you make the underflaps of my breasts burn  like when i used to rub them with poison sumac  but your kids sure love you  as evinced by the amount of treacly blubbering  i had to sit through  mr shues the only teacher at this school who asks you  how youre doing and actually wants to hear an answer  mr shues the only teacher at this school  that ever really touched me  besides mr ryerson  he taught me how to tie my shoelaces  i used to think that i was the best thing  that happened to this school but  i was wrong  mr schuester is  mr shue taught me the second half of the alphabet  i stopped after m and n  i felt they were too similar and got frustrated  you know william one thing i learned  in my time as president  principal  you cant force public opinion  i pardoned you  sometimes you got to give the inmates what they want  you throw em a comb and hope they stop  beating each other long enough to whittle it into a shiv  well i am relieved  i sort of thought id been replaced  aw shut your gash nancy  and as a condition  of my not pressing charges your glee club  will return my lecar to mint condition  i suggest selling yourself  on craigslist under the heading  of men seeking men with buttchins  all right all right thank you very much guys  please please sit down just  thank you  for that and and for all the kind words  you said about me to sue  the feelings are mutual  now we got to get crackin though  we lost a few days there and its all gonna be  about focus and hard work for the next  couple of days i guess ms holliday really is gone  i know you guys liked her and she was a lot of fun  but she and i both agreed that this is what was best  dont get us wrong mr shue  we always wanted you as our teacher  she was just kind of a nice break  she did loosen us up  and she actually had some good ideas for a sub  yeah i get it  and maybe we can uh incorporate those  after sectionals  now when im sick  there is only one thing that makes me feel better  gin and juice  no singin in the rain  i mustve watched it like  ten times over the past three days  its actually what inspired me to try this out  as a contender for our first song at sectionals  when is the song from  well the movie opened in 1952  butbut but its but its really timeless  mary todd lincoln in the house  my husband was probably gay and im bipolar  which makes me yell things like  that teapots spreading lies about me  or that cant be my baby because i dont love it  ms holliday can i talk to you for a sec  sure  guys practice your bipolar rants okay  see history can be fun  how are you holding up  okay  im back to my itinerant ways i guess  i do miss glee club though  well as much as the kids like me  they sure do miss you  which is why next time im sick  im requesting you as the glee sub  really  mr schuester thats so nice of you  it would be nice to feel like a part of something you know  i know  i actually need your help  with something else though  see ive been dying to do singin in the rain  with the kids show them how great it is  but theyre convinced its too oldfashioned mm  would you mind helping me make it a little more modern  i thought youd never ask   uhhuh uhhuh   yeah holly   uhhuh uhhuh   good girl gone bad   uhhuh uhhuh  take three   action go  uhhuh uhhuh   you have my heart   and well never be   worlds apart   maybe
