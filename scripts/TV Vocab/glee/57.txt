rachel laughing  look what i just found in my locker  bee mine forever from your secret honey  i swear that blaine is such a romantic  horrifying  finn rachel come on thats enough  everyone sit down uh listen up  rory has the floor  ive been trying to get my student visa extended  so i can spend junior year at mckinley  but i just found out the request was turned down  so when the school year ends ill have to go back to ireland  what  i miss my family so much  but you guys have become my second family  this song reminds me of you guys and  how much ive grown to love  each and every single one of you  and how thankful i am that youve made a place  away from ireland  feel like home  michael bubles home begins  another summer day has come and gone away   in paris and rome  but i wanna go home  mm home  maybe surrounded by a million people i   still feel all alone  just wanna go home  oh i miss you you know  and ive been keeping all the letters   that i wrote to you  each one a line or two  im fine baby how are you   well i would send them  but i know that its just not enough   my words were cold and flat  and you deserve more than that   another airplane another sunny place   im

home  rory  i feel worse for you than i do for artie  will you be my date for valentines day  it would be an honor  school bell rings  all right guys  we have to have a discussion  and figure out what the god squad feels  about singing to gay people  well three of us are in glee club  so were pretty much sing to gay people all the time  i know were okay with it but joe may not be  i try my best not to judge anybody  but honestly ive never met anyone whos gay  oh i guarantee you have  yeah they say that one out of every ten people are gay  and if thats true that means one of the 12 apostles  might have been gay  and my guess is simon because that names the gayest  the bible says its  an abomination for a man to lay down with another man  but we shared tents in cub scouts  and slept next to each other all the time  so that would make cub scouts an abomination  do you know what else the bible says is an abomination  eating lobster  planting different crops in the same field  giving somebody a proud look  not an abomination slavery  jesus never said anything about gay people  thats a fact  well maybe he wanted to  but he didnt want to hurt simons feelings  you guys we have to figure out where we stand  especially if were gonna be asking volunteers  from my church to sing backup for us  i dont want to hurt santanas feelings  but i also dont want to make someone  do something theyre not comfortable with  so where do you stand joe  i guess ive gotta think about it  you know what thats totally fair  you have to look at the hard topics and dilemmas  and be honest and truthful  if you ask me  thats what being christian is really about  school bell rings  i know its early but  its a statue of st valentine  well actually its a statue  of one of the three wise men  i repainted to look like saint  i told shane about us  wow  was he mad he was sad  he cried and said it felt like i punched him in his heart  i saw this mma guy get punched in the heart once  he died for like a minute  that sucks  at least it means we can be together for real now  whoa  what we did what i did to shane was wrong  i lied i cheated  and it makes me feel awful  and i love you but being with you just reminds me of that  that im not the person that i thought i was  we would never do that to each other  i thought that id never do that to shane  but i have to face the truth  when it comes to love i dont know who i am  and until i find out i cant be with anyone  ii cant be with you  school bell ringing  whitney houstons i will always love you begins  if i  should stay  i would only be in  your way  so ill go  but i know  ill think of you  every step of  the way  and i  will always love you  i  will always love you  you you  you  my darling you  hums  bittersweet  memories  that is all im taking  with me  so goodbye  please dont cry  we both know im not what you   you need  and i  will always love you  i  will always  love you  you  i hope  life treats you kind  and i hope  you have all youve dreamed of   and i wish to you joy  and happiness  but above all this i wish you   love  and i  will always love you  i will always  love you  i will always  love you  i will always  love you  i i will always  love you  i i will always  love  you  you  darling i love you  oh ill always  ill always  love you  song ends  scatting  youre the top  youre an arrow collar  youre

exact opposite of what their parents tell them  i dont know where she got this idea of marriage anyway  but shes not going to go through with it  she is a little girl with big dreams  its too bad i like finn  nobody is saying that they have to break up  theyre just too young to get married  as long as we continue to do what were doing  lying about supporting it utterly and completely  shell come around and shell see it our way  its reverse psychology   its the only way  rachel hey  were gonna go go breadstix  we decided that we want to just be with our friends tonight  and then im probably
