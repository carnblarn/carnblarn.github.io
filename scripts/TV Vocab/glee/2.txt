guess i just dont have a gag reflex  one day when youre older  thatll turn out to be a gift  lets have a little chat okay  school bell ringing  clears throat rachel bulimia is a very  messy serious disease  i dont have bulimia  i tried it and failed and wont ever attempt it again  okay  it grossed me out  okay but i still want to talk  about the feelings that you had  that led up to you wanting to puke your guts out  i want to be thinner  and prettier like that quinn girl  mmhmm and um why is that  have you ever liked somebody so much  you just want to lock yourself in your room  turn on sad music and cry  no  to song on radio  all by my   crying  by myself  im by myself   dont want to be   uh but a boy crush huh  i know about that i mean not now  it takes me back in the day  like a long time ago i knew about that  you know what you need to remember rachel  to protect your heart  i dont care who he is  if he doesnt like you for the way you are  or if hes you know hes married  with a baby on the way  thats not worth the heartache  you dont want to compromise yourself for that  um clears throat  have you just tried  telling him how you feel  he doesnt even notice me  i see  um okay well heres what i think  common interests are the key to romance  all ght so find out what he likes  then hell see you in a positive way and  maybe youll end up doing something  sue would you like  to tell principal figgins and mr schuester  what i caught you two doing  it just sort of happened  i dont mean to be rude  but i think shes overreacting  you watch your tone young lady  gay parents encourage rebellion  there are studies on this  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  all right tell me what happened rachel  finn was worried about having to perform a solo  at the pep assembly in front of his chromosomallychallenged  friends  i was immediately concerned  by his lack of selfesteem  and made a creative preemptive strike  yeah pretty much what she said  you know one of the amazing things  about being in the performing arts is that  you can parlay it into so many different fields  like justin timberlake  hes a singer but he also has a clothing line  and you know he makes things like shirts and belts  who is justin timberlake  rachel it was a twofold plan  we figured that with the right marketing strategy  we could pull from the entire student body  without having an assembly  thus creating the diverse glee club  this school has been craving  that copy machine is for cheerios use only  paid for by alumni donations  i cant begin to fathom the damage  youd have done to the program had you broken it  hold on a second sue  i resent being told  to hold on to anything william  i will not be treated  like a secondclass citizen because of my gender  there is a very clear bureaucracy  when it comes to photocopies and you seem to think  that these procedures dont apply to your students  it is my strong recommendation  that both these students be hobbled  how many copies did you guys make   okay and how much does a photocopy cost  fourandahalf cents  how about they just pay for the copies  i like this compromise  children pay ms sylvester  and well let you off with a warning  and sue im sorry but ill have to ask you  to personally clean the congealed  protein shake off the photocopy room floor  thats why we have janitors  sue were in a recession and concessions must be made  ive laid off half the janitorial staff  we all need to lend a hand  lady justice wept today  im sorry about that mr shue  id like to get the flyers up before lunch tomorrow  you know what guys i dont want to hear it  doing that song is going to kill any chance the glee club has  its a terrible idea  i have news for you rachel  sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do  were doing the assembly  and youre not putting up those flyers  everybody loves disco  its official  im a dead man  look i know youre nervous  but youre really really talented  stop it  i mean maybe itll all be okay  do you want to practice  for the assembly tomorrow after school  i cant i got a celibacy club meeting  baby i have some bad news  a wealthy relative died  i dont have any wealthy relatives  oh  ive just been pounding the pavement  all week after glee rehearsal  i i cant find any extra work  that probably means no grand foyer  why cant we ever be the ones to catch a break  no no its going to be okay baby  i mean we dont need a grand foyer to be happy  no you know what im so tired of the compromising  i want my grand foyer i want my dream house  i work hard i sacrifice  i deserve it  you know we give and we give  do you think that the big shots  at sheets n things care  that i sell more personal massagers  than any other assistant manager  no or do you think that those kids  that they give a damn that we go with so little  because you spend all your spare time  choreographing those stupid dance routines  i mean when  does anyone start giving back  sighs  rapid scraping  i thought you asked sue to clean up after herself  sue got a note from the school nurse claiming  that her lupus made it impossible  to bend over a bucket of suds  ive been here till 1000 pm every night  up to my elbows in vamoose  any problem with me taking over  one of those nighttime janitorial slots  ill work at half salary  the celibacy club is now in session  thanks to a school rule  that says we have to let anyone join the club  were welcoming a new member this week  rachel whatshername  where are all the boys  down the hall  first half hour we separate  then we come together to share our faith  finn im still on the fence about the celibacy club  i mean i only joined to get into quinn fabrays pants  still it is a productive way for us guys to get together  and talk about sexual issues  i think im going to kill myself  im serious  were bombarded with sexual imagery every day  beer ads those short skirts  im supposed to be surrounded by temptation  not be able to do anything about it  are you kidding  those skirts are crunchy toast  santana lopez bent over in hers the other day  and i swear i could see her ovaries  god bless the perv that invented these  remember the power motto girls  all its all about the teasing and not about the pleasing  oh back it up like a dump truck  baby  so how far does quinn let you get anyway  we grind make out  but how do you keep from arriving early  whenever i grind cinco de mayo  laughs  its not a problem for me man  actually its a big problem  somebody once told me  that to keep from erupting too early  you should think of dead kittens and stuff  but the only image that works for me happened  the day my mom took me out  to practice for my drivers permit  pretty good honey  who says a father figures necessary huh  laughs  drivings fun yeah  grunts screams  oh my god  oh my oh my oh my god you killed him  what are you gonna do  lets pair up for the immaculate affection  now remember if the balloon pops  the noise makes the angels cry  male chorus vocalizing  female chorus harmonizing  you enchant me  boy yeah  stop it take it  ah yeah oh  finn  it must have hit my zipper  you know what this is a joke  did you know  that most studies have demonstrated  that celibacy doesnt work in high schools  our hormones  are driving us too crazy to abstain  the second we start telling ourselves  that theres no room for compromise we act out  the only way to deal with teen sexuality  is to be prepared  thats what contraception is for  dont you dare mention the c word  you want to know a dirty little secret  that none of them want you to know  girls want sex just as much as guys do  isis that accurate  scraping  will  aah aah  emma what are you doing here so late  i do sat prep on tuesday nights  are you um are you a janitor  a ja no  really  cause youre dressed like a janitor  and your shirt says will  um terri and i are trying to buy a house  and were you know struggling to make ends meet and  sighs  im really embarrassed  would you mind keeping this between us  yeah  oh yeah your secrets completely safe with me  thank you  do you um  do you want a hand  oh no  iim good really  really because um i can see from here  that youve used window cleaner to mop the floor  and uh that keyboard is crawling in e coli  because i know for a fact ms hoffmeyer  doesnt wash her hands after doing number twos  i really admire you working so hard for something you want  lets make a deal  youre helping me with my problem  how about i take a stab at one of yours  oh no i dont  i dont have a problem  youve been scrubbing that pencil sharpener for an hour  well i mean i have  i have a little trouble with messes  but its not like its a problem  okay  when i was a little girl  it was my dream to work on a dairy farm  really  um when i was eight  we finally visited one and after the tour  and the yogurt tasting my my brother  pushed me into the runoff lagoon  what  and um ever since then ive just  ive had a little trouble  forgetting the uh the smell  have you thought about i dont know  maybe seeing someone about that  oh no its completely manageable  you know i just try to take lots of showers  and i um you know i dont eat dairy  so  i want to try  a little experiment  oh no no im not really um comfortable  with with that  there  ten seconds  new record  its late i should um  i should be um going  gavel banging i officially  call this meeting of glee club in session  but mr schuester isnt here mr schuester isnt coming  i paid a freshman to ask him for help  with irregular verbs mercedes groans  im so sick of hearing you squawk eva peron  let her talk  i have another idea for the assembly  can i once again stress my most strenuous  objections to this attempted suicide  theyre not going to kill us  because were going to give them what they want  blood better  sex  feedback squeaks  silence children  silence  first an announcement  the toilets are broken again  we are fixing the problem but let me warn you  there will be zero tolerance  for anyone soiling school grounds  were not going to have a repeat of last time  we have a treat for you guys today  mr schuester  yay glee  glee kids hooray  hi uh when i went to school here  glee club ruled this place  and were on our way back  but we need some recruits to join the party  now i could tell you all about  how great glee is but

break the silence  that was the most offensive thing ive seen  in 20 years of teaching  and that includes an elementary school production of hair  we received angry emails  from a number of concerned parents  many of whom thought that their children were going to hear  a special olympian speak about overcoming adversity  i i really dont know what to say  well let me help you out then  my first thought  was that your students should be  put into foster care  sighs  but youre the one who should be punished  i demand your resignation from this school  as well as the disbanding of glee club  now hold on sue  the issue is content  those kids are talented  and i have not seen the student body this excited  since tiffany performed at the north hills mall  i took the liberty of calling my pastor  to provide a list of familyfriendly songs  that reflect our communitys values  your kids can only perform these preapproved musical selections  but all these songs have either  jesus or balloons in the title  but theyre also songs about the circus  this egg is sunnyside up will  you need new outfits  i got several flashes of panty from your group today  and im not talking about the girls  so sue im cutting your drycleaning budget  to pay for new costumes for the glee club  this will not stand  oh sue  the drycleaners here are just as good as the ones  in europe  mr schuester im so sorry  do you understand what you did today you lied to me  and you ruined our chances no parent in their right mind  is going to let their kid join glee now  oh and uh heres a list  of the songs that were allowed to sing  whats a luftballoon  look i know how much you care about glee club  and i understand why you did what you did  but i dont like the way you did it  theyre for tulipalooza  its a tulip festival down  at the columbus convention center  its supposed to smell pretty nice  thats really sweet of you ken  but i have a asthma  what are you doing  chasing a married guy  i saw you playing house  with him after hours emma  look  i dont know a lot about relationships  most of mine are short and flame out once the sex goes  but i do know you never want to be the rebounder  im a good man emma  ill treat you right ill put up with all your crazy  they cant fire me cause im a minority  so ill always be able to provide for you  you could do a lot worse  and in this town youre not going to do much better  okay im done talking now  try it   la   good that was good  okay one more up plays higher note   la   that was really good is that okay  yeah its like the holy grail for a baritenor  so its a good note  all right ill start  at the bottom and then well go up higher  can we take a break  singing kind of makes me a little hungry  yeah sure  well lucky i prepared for that  wow i was wondering what that was all about  want to sit  yeah yeah  absolutely  i was wondering why you asked me to help you with your singing  you kicked butt at the assembly  well this is  my only chance to be  you know good like you  you think im good  well when i first joined i thought you were kind of insane  i mean you talk a lot more than you should and to be honest  with you i looked under the bed  and made sure that you werent  hanging out under there  but then i heard you sing  i dont know how to say this  but you touched something in me  right here  your hearts on the other  side of your chest  oh  its beating really hard  youre cool rachel  do you want a drink  yeah  virgin cosmos cool  that stuff you said at the celibacy club  that was really cool  thanks  well  cheers

the assembly  quinns audition song was on figginss approved list  and frankly she did a heck of a job singing it  youre punishing me  contrary to your beliefs its not all about you  or ive realized about me  look i screwed up too  im as responsible for what you did at that assembly as you are  i should never have pushed disco so hard  when we did it back in 93 the disco revival was in its heyday  it was cool we had fun  and that that is what glee is supposed to be about  if were going to succeed  we both need to change our mindsets  youre not always going to be the star  but i promise to do my best  to make sure youre always having fun  this is a good thing rachel  were on our way  can i use the auditorium later to practe  our neighbors are filing a lawsuit  sure  take a bow plays   you
