food  but its a new year and you and i  are the best singers at this school  i dont get what the big deal is  its just a free trip to breadstix  um im sorry have you been to breadstix  they are legally forbidden to stop bringing you breadsticks  one time i brought a wheelbarrow  and when the mager tried  to stop me from filling it up  i calleded the corporae office and got her fired  sighs  well i guess our voices do sorta go together  mmhmm thats right girl  so if we do a duet together we will be  the undisputed top bitches at this school  bell ringing  you cant do this to him  youre overreacting  if he sings with you  youre painting a bullseye on his back  once again your closeted homophobia seeps to the surface  like the contents of a cracked cesspool  dont give me that  look i know i shouldnt have used that word in your basement  but its not like you were innocent  i really like you kurt  but the fact of the matter is  the way you were all over me last year  if i did that to a girl shed take out a restraining order  you have issues with me being gay i get it  no actually i dont  i have issues with the fact that  you dont understand that no means no  i just want to sing

selfish  the fact is is im only really generous  if theres something in it for me  yeah but i still like you  but you youre so kind aand open  well its made me want to be a better person  we have to throw the competition  i love breadstix  no iiif we wanna win at nationals  then sam has to win this contest  okay he has to feel like he belongs and  and the team has to believe in him  wow rachel i never seen you like this  im kind of impressed  well like i said  you inspired me  but technically youre doing this  because itll help us win nationals  which means theres something in it for you  so it doesnt really count as you doing something nice  okay so im just gonna ignore what you just said  repeat what i said before we just have to find a way  for me to lose a singing competition  so that the new kid sticks around  right  i dont want to do it were duet partners you have to sing  i dont even know if i can sing  everyo knows im here to do one thing dance  you sing and ill dance around you youll be fine no no  were singing together  we are gonna win that dinner at breadstix  and then we can finally have a normal night out  normal what do you mean  we went out last night  for dim sum with your mom  all we ever do is get dim sum with your mom  here we go  hi  so i just want you to know  im really into you  okay  sorry im  just a little confused  youve never even made eye contact with me  i know for a while i thought you were a robot  tina im not saying that  steamed pork knuckles arent delicious  im just saying that at breadstix  they have bottomless salad bowls  they refill your salad until you leave or pass out  you can get salad at dim sum  my mom got salad last night  there were chicken feet in it  it was a chicken feet salad  all i want is a normal salad  that doesnt have chicken feet in it  so let me get this straight  you want to be my girlfriend  because you like the idea of  wheeling me around  i just really want to get you in a stroller  mike youre not listening to me  you dont care about my needs  shh  were fighting a lot  we should go to asian couples therapy  why does the couples therapy have to be asian  so i get to tell everybody that were dating  yes  and i get a duet partner  i dont see the big deal  he emailed me like  and i thought it was faith hill  the kids good  look this isnt about how good kurt is  being in glee club is like  its like walking down the double yellow lines  of a highway  if you get just a little off course  youre gonna get crushed  i got to be honest  youre kind of confusing my head right now  i mean do you remember  what you said when  you talked me into joining glee club  bell ringing  nationals are in new york city  can you imagine at its going to be like  coming home with that firstplace trophy  most of the kids in this town have never even seen the ocean  well be gods  i joined up because im new here  and you said it would make me popular  and now youre telling me that its going to get me killed  well eventually youre going get popular from it  believe me but until then  you got to lay low a little bit  aand singing a duet with another dude  is not laying low  i didnt realize you had a problem with gay dudes  look i dont have a problem with gay dudes  everyone else does and were living  in their world and in their world  you singing a duet with kurt is a death sentence  sighs  well  i gave him my word  in my world thats that  boom  welcome to glee club lady lips  laughter  the blueberry flavor is the worst  especially if it gets down your pants  i looked like a creature out of avatar down there  when i got slushied  i saw avatar like six times  oh  anyway youll get used to it  youre the head cheerleader  why do you even bother  i mean you dont need glee club  i like to sing and the fact is  those guys were pretty cool to me  last year when i wasnt on top  whats the point of being popular  when you cant do what you want  lor manari  it means you have pretty eyes  its navi the avatar language  lor manari  first course is served  hearthealthy vegan carrot soup  with whole grain croutons  and youd better eat all of it  do you have any idea how hard it is to find saffron in this town  all right let me eat this at the table  you could make a plaster cast of my ass  with the cushions from this couch  absolutely not  i am in charge of your care from now on  you had a serious arrhythmia dad  the doctors say you need to rest until your stress test  youre my stress test  guess this means i cant get salt  sighs  chin up  whats up  hows school  sighs  its fine i guess  theres this new kid sam in glee club  he and i are singing a duet together  is that a problem  finn practically begged me not to  he said itd ruin sams reputation  well this kid sam uh  you know does he he play for your team  undetermined  oh  maybe finn has a point  youre siding with him  after what he called me in our basement  i was talking to carole and you werent totally honest with me  she told me that you had a crush on finn  and you werent afraid to show it  is this true  so a gay guy cant be friendly  to a straight guy without it being predatory  you got to understand  that most guys dont know how to deal  with unwanted advances  so youre saying i shouldnt sing with this sam guy  because it might upset a couple homophobes  i thought you said no one pushes the hummels around  sighs  no one does  iim im not saying that  iim im saying  that maybe its you whos pushing  this kid sam around trying to take advantage of him  because youre interested in him  dad you have no idea what its like  i am the only openly gay kid at school in this town  i mean why cant i walk hand in hand  down the hall with a person that i like  why cant i slowdance at my prom  come here  you think i dont want those things for you  i do  you know until you find somebody  as open and as brave as you  youre just going to have to get used to going it alone  ike and tina turners river deep  mountain

claps  yes artie mmhmm  can we talk yeah  i want us to be duet partners  really  we sing really well together  i just thought if we won  we could share a nice free dinner together  as friends  we

romance  if youll excuse me  will okay guys so  who is up first today  mr shue if i may  you may  as many of you know i had a duet partner  but due to sensitivities id rather not get into  at the moment i have dissolved the partnership  okay so who are you going to sing a duet with  only the most talented member of the glee club myself  when youre different when youre special  sometimes you have to get used to being alone  ive asked a few members of the glee club  as well as some cheerios to help me out  how can you do a duet by yourself  thats like vocal masturbation or something  scattered snickering  i will be doing a number  from the seminal classic movie victorvictoria  its a show about embracing both the male  and the female sides  watch and learn santana  hit it  le jazz hot playing  bout 20 years ago   way down in new orleans   a group of fellers found   a new kind of music   and they decided to call it   jazz   no other sound has   what this music has   before they knew it   it was whizzin round the world   the world was ready   for a blue kind of music   and now they play it   from steamboat springs   to la paz   oh baby   wont you play me   le jazz hot   maybe

been down this path before i know this feeling  anxious sigh like i need you  duets dont work for me and i dont need you  what i need is to find a way to keep santana off my heels  im im sorry what i need is to find a way to torture rachel  and i need to start learning to ignore people  and im sorry i shouldnt  i shouldnt have tried that  im sorry  i made a mistake and um  i dont want to sing with you  bell rings  i dont think i could do this  its the perfect song for this very situation  whenever youre ready guys  santana yeah hurry up i needs to get myself  to breadstix  dont count on it  im mad at you but youre still so hot  trust me youre gonna be great  see i really couldnt sing   i could never really sing   what i couldnt do is  sing   i have trouble with the   note  it goes all around my   throat  its a terrifying   thing  see i really couldnt   hear which note was lower or was  higher  which is why   i disappear if someone says   lets start a  choir   hey when i begin to squeak   its a cross between a  shriek   and a quiver or a  moan   its a little like a  croak   or the record player b  what it doesnt have is  tone   oh i know youre thinking what a crazy   tempo slows dingaling   but i really couldnt  sing   i could never really  sing   what i couldnt do is  sing   but what i lack in pitch  i sure make up in  power   and all my  friends say i am perfect for the  shower   still im terrific at a  dance   cause im messing up my  pants   im a birdie on the  wing   but if i begin to  chirp   they say whos the little  twerp   going pong instead of  ping   and when christmas comes and all my friends go   all tempo slowing caroling   it is so dishearten  ning   it is so disquiet  ting   it is so discourage  ging   darling please stop answer   ring   see i

me these vibes  and those eyes  hey quinn can we talk  what do you want to talk about about sam ii heard  that you backed out of doing the duet with him  maybe its for the best she backed out  i mean if that puckerman kid ever gets out of jail  hes gonna beat my ass  im sure you still have feelings for her too  no no no way im with rachel now  i mean shes a lot shorter than quinn  and she talks a lot but im in love with her  look ththis isnt about dating dude  this is about you singing with quinn  to raise your musical rep in the group  look i understand that your reputation is important to you but  wouldnt you want to do whatever it takes to be on top  of the proverbial pyramid in every aspect of your life  singing with sam wont change that  oh but winning the competition will  and partnering with sam is really your only shot at it  whats your angle  angle whats your angle  me winning means you losing  and youll do whatever it takes to make sure  that doesnt happen so what is in it for you  look i agree  okay youre probably not gonna beat finn and i  but i just thought that  as the team captain it would be good for the team  to have some healthy competition for second place  finn look im not saying youre gonna win but im just saying  that you know even coming in second  would go a long way with the rest of the team  bell rings hey  listen i was totally out of line with you  i promise it wont happen again  though you might have to wear sunglasses whenever were together  good because were gonna have to spend a lot of time together practicing  if were gonna win that
