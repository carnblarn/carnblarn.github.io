third place the unitards  harmony  hi i just wanted to tell you  that i thought you were really amazing  and just think im only a sophomore  and im already this good  next years going to be a bloodbath  in second place  we have the trouble tones  in first place is new directions    well my suspension is officially over  itll still be on my transcript though  im just hoping that  the admissions department at nyada sees it  as a sign of my artistic rebellious attitude  good luck with that  are you going to go tell figgins about shelby  cause i just i still think  that its a really terrible idea  i came here to talk to you actually  to tell you im not going to tell  why  because i love beth and i dont want to ruin her life  i wanted to thank you actually  for what  for keeping me from doing something stupid  something i would have regretted my entire life  were kind of friends huh  kind of  what do you think about yale  oh no i have my sights set on nyada  no for me  im not the singer that you and kurt are  but yale has an amazing drama program  and i really do like to perform yeah  certainly would nail all the parts where the girl has to cry  no i think its a great idea  i mean especially since you wont have me to compete with  youre a lot better than you know  well ill see you at glee club  where are you going i have a couple people i need to talk to  okay well i dont know  if you need help with your yale application  not with the yale application  but um there is something you could do for me  we were better i dont know i think it could have gone either way  it was that damn trouty mouth  even i felt a little something in my lady loins  when he did that magic sex dance  all right ladies girl talk  no uhuh dont you dare try and give us a pep talk  or ask us to come back to new directions not interested  wait is it even possible do you think they would  really take us back of course they would take us back  but im telling you im not going  do you know what growing up is about  losing things  in six months well all be gone scattered  well keep in touch  yeah but it wont be the same  when we see each other itll be a special occasion  itll be different  i dont want to grow up yet  im not ready to lose you girls  what are we supposed to do  come back to glee club and sing background for blaine and berry  until we graduate im not doing that again  we know what it feels like to be out front now  what if mr shue agreed to let the trouble tones  sing at least one number per competition  well even if mr shue did agree to that rachel never would  what if i told you that they both already did  im listening  look i know i went a little crazy  but im here now  im 17 i have the rest of my life in front of me  i love glee club  i love you
