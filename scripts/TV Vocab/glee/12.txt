                how do you think that makes me feel  also terri said shes pregnant wow  but really shes faking and mr schuster doesnt know  this babys the only reason hes still here  wills busy getting the kids ready for sectionals  where theyre up against a school for the deaf  i cant hear you talk into this ear scarlet fever  youre on  and a group of juvie girls  aphasia give mr schuster his wallet back  but it turns out both of them are really good  its like cool epilepsy also sue kicked quinn out  of the cheerios because shes pregnant  i cant have a pregnant girl on my squad  youre a disgrace  its not very nice but neither is sue  those drinks are crap  and thats what you missed on   glee    hey guys mind if i join you  so whats with all the primping  yearbook pictures  this is the 50th edition  of the mckinley high school thunderclap  im going to drop 20 pounds by friday  look smoking hot for that photo  and be down to a trim 210 for the wedding a week saturday  of course the wedding  was going to be in hawaii but then they told me  i couldnt bring my own fruit so  but sectionals is a week from saturday  oh man  looks like you wont be able to make it eminem  i um i totally forgot about sectionals  imim sorry i wanted to go  for the kids  were not rescheduling  the vfw hall is booked till next june  the only reason this saturday is available  is cause its the one year anniversary  of that grisly fish fry shootout  i got a monster discount  we just got to be out of there before the candlelight vigil  i remember  oh my gosh  sue  did someone finally punch you  edie  william you  every year when the photos for the thunderclap  come around i always elect to have a little work done  this year i got myself a bit of an eye lift  and while they were in there  i told them to go ahead and yank out those tear ducts  wasnt using them  you know i got a storage unit  full of trophies and medallions  but for the rest of you educators  these yearbook pictures  are really the only concrete proof you have  that anything youve done  in your sorry little lives  has made any difference whatsoever  my cheerios are so excited  got them on a yam diet  it draws the water out of the skin  well im sure my glee kids are going to be excited too  well glee kids dont get a photo  what why is that  well i just had a meeting with principal figgins eleanor  and what with all the vandalism  of the glee club photos over the years  i convinced him that putting the glee kids  in this years thunderclap was subjecting the little freaks  to more humiliation  and ridicule  why cant you just accept the fact that my kids  are going to take sectionals this year  thats not happening  and stop with the pointless vendetta  right  this is so not fair sue  you know im going to talk to figgins about this  hey good luck with that  you know you three are boring me now  im going to go do something else  wheres rachel  shes not here yet  perfect  glee club stands on a delicate precipice  we have all felt the cold  humiliation of a slushie in the face  but as of right now our relative anonymity as a club  shields us from more severe persecution  swirlies  patriotic wedgies  whats a patriotic wedgie  its when they hoist you up the flag pole by your undies  strangely it did make me feel more american  based on my investigation  i am of the opinion that a yearbook photo  would only fuel the flames of antigleeclub terror  ive done a little library research  peter gellar glee club second tenor 1998  he can be seen here with both  a drawn on hitler mustache and rice paddy hat  shortly after the yearbook came out  mr gellar had a nervous breakdown  he is now the homeless man  who sleeps in front of the public library  patches  patches  he barks at my mom  exhibit b  tawny peterson glee club class of 2000  seen here in her photo with a cartoon knife stuck in her head  in a macabre tableau that in four years  would prove eerily prescient  i think i speak for all of us when i say  that not having to pose for a yearbook photo  might be a blessing in disguise  i suggest not fighting figgins ruling  oh hey guys  ah looking at old thunderclaps  its really unsettling  and totally unfair  hey can i borrow one of these  you know what this years thunderclap  is going to have a glee club photo with every one  of your smiling faces  you have my word on it   shue im doing the glee club a solid  were denying the opportunity to other children  to further humiliate them  no no no those kids get up on stage all the time  no matter what anyone thinks of them  and they perform  they dont let anyone or anything get to them  thats something you should encourage  sue is wrong  fine ill give them a photo  thank you  for 1000  what  thats what is costs  the yearbook is prime advertising space shue  fredericksons funeral parlor  experienced a 13 increase in revenue  after their full page ad last year in the thunderclap  okay um  what about a quarter page  how much does that cost  325  that will buy you enough space for a photo  of two members of the glee club  right below the advertisement  for uncle sandros chicken inside of a waffle  figgins thats a lot of money  its a compromise shue  now i suggest you select a goodlooking cheerleader  not the pregnant one  and the quarterback for the photo  as their faces are less likely  to be scratched out with safety pins  mr schuster im very sorry to interrupt  principal figgins  as you very well may know this is my first year  in glee club and ive just been informed  that new directions has not been afforded a yearbook photo  as you might expect my two gay dads  have a very close relationship with our local branch  of the aclu and if its up to me  beat you to the punch rachel  its all good  were in the yearbook  oh fantastic  thank you so much  make fun of me all you want  but school pictures are everything to me  theyre great practice for getting photographed  by the paparazzi  invasive as the press may be  stars are dependent on them for their fame  and i feel i must be prepared  in order to do so i join every club i possibly can  know youre thinking that im just joining all of these clubs  to give off the appearance that im involved known to exist  but glee club is different  i really love glee  and i believe in what we stand for  weve come from behind  dismissed and ridiculed by everyone  and weve made something of ourselves  something that im proud to be a part of  something i want to be remembered for  oh thats got the whole flag  i miss my cheerios uniform  made me feel safe  contained  even when i was feeling left out  at least i looked like i was a part of something  i want my kids to be able to look back at these books  and see who i was  make them proud  not the bastard one im carrying now of course  the ones ill have when im married and ready  i might not look like the head cheerleader anymore  but im still her on the inside  im done playing the victim  when that cheerleading picture is taken for the yearbook  im going to be in it and back on the squad  whether sue sylvester likes it or not  hey baby which one of these ties goes better with my shirt  youre blocking the tv will  oh come on i need your help  school pictures are coming up  oh well in that case um  wear the red one for the teacher photo  and the green one for the glee club  okay  itll pop more when the cool kids deface it  yeah i uh  i wanted to talk to you about that  so figgins stopped putting the glee club photo in the yearbook  because it always gets vandalized  and i just feel so bad for the kids  i mean they work so hard they deserve to be recognized  not being in that book gives the appearance  that glee club isnt important  i want to buy an ad and use it as the glee club photo spread  its around 300  oh great  yeah why dont you take the food  out of the refrigerator and just give that to the kids  will that food goes from my mouth  right into our babys belly  we have a couple hundred bucks left over  from selling the blue bomber ii  the answers no will no  but if we no  no no  actually can you wait to cash that until thursday  kurt i have a fantastic idea for a club  that would officially make me the most involved student  in the whole school  i want us to start a gaylesball  im sorry  the gaylesbian alliance  gaylesball  hey guys  great news  glee club gets a photo in the thunderclap  yep  its going to show everyone at the school  that glee club is on its way up  when we win regionals  those claps are going to be collectors items  i mean all of your classmates are going to be  begging for your autographs  but i had to compromise to do it  um we only get a quarter page in back  which means we have to pick two team captains  to appear in the photo  so tomorrow were going to put it to a vote  exciting huh  all right  well were all here i guess we should vote  with your permission  i have prepared a few words  i nominate rachel second  all right lets vote up in this piece  i gotta go hit the gym and load up the guns of puckerone  for the football picture  looks like everybody voted for rachel  including rachel  but we need two captains guys  why two  were fine with having rachel represent us  in the thunderclap by herself  wed actually prefer it  the worst part is  that after all this time  theyre still embarrassed to be in glee club  i mean they still see themselves as losers  i just need to get one of them  to step up and become cocaptain  well maybe you should let them use the captain  they already elected  you know sometimes sound a lot different coming from a peer  even if that peer is an annoying as rachel  you know  none of this is going to matter if they win at sectionals  im really sorry i cant be there  yeah i wanted to talk to you about that  ii kind of think ken scheduled your wedding  the same day on purpose  you know  so so you couldnt go  why would he do that  come on  we both know how he feels about our relationship  im marrying ken will  look i know that ive  ive definitely given him reason in the past  to be jealous but i need you to know  that im done with that now  ken has a lot of flaws  he has 74 flaws as of yesterday but you know what  he is not vindictive  hes actually a very good man  he is kind and hes great with the students here at mckinley  we have that in common  and yes its true his hygiene could be a lot better  but he is absolutely full of compassion  and well that is why im marrying him  youre right  i was out of line  it wont happen again  you wanted to see me mr shue  oh yeah rach  sit down  so hows the new captaincy going  i think that my unanimous election  gave me a very strong mandate to shake things up  great well  i have a job for you captain  we need a cocaptain  you have so many great ideas  no reason you shouldnt have some help  pushing them through  i could use a trusty lieutenant  i do have over 65 proposals  so can i count on you  no problem  im on it  um i cant be cocaptain no time kwanza  kwanzas late december mercedes  the photos this thursday  yeah prepping early this year  id love to be in the photo rachel  but youd be standing and id be sitting  and it would throw off the whole composition  ill lean over  but if you lean over  it will look like you have stomach rolls  on second thought  i dont think that youre leadership material artie  follower  brittany this is a once in a lifetime opportunity  no way why not  because i dont want to be in a picture with you  itll get defaced  no it wont yes it will  ill be the one doing it  im desperate  glee club needs you finn  im totally honored you asked me  but dont you think you should pick somebody  who like cares more  not that i dont  but i just have football and friends and stuff  glee club only started working after you joined  face it we wouldnt have all of the cheerleaders  and football players in the club  if it wasnt for you  you know i love glee club  i just dont know why i have to represent it  because youre a leader finn  and thats what leaders do  they stick their necks out for people that they care about  there are stakes here  morale is low you know it  if things dont change  were not even going to place at sectionals  and then the club is over  i cant do this alone  you dont have to  i am a leader  thats who i am who i want to be  you got yourself a cocaptain  ill do the picture with you  i totally understand that as captain of the football team  youve worked really hard to project an appearance  of steely toughness but glee club is different  we have to present the appearance  of positivity and optimism  so were gonna practice  and im going to teach you  how to smile correctly for your photo    when you first left me i was wanting more      you were kissing that girl next door      whatd you do that for     whatd you do that for      when you first left me      i didnt know what to say      i never been on my own that way     own that

first station wagon she could jimmy open  throwing away any chance she ever had in life  it would be good for the school  show everyone that appearances dont matter  that sometimes people have to deal with a little adversity  i learned that in glee club  well that little educational proverb must have slithered  from will schuesters mouth right after his lesson  on how to disqualify yourselves from sectionals  what  saw your little commercial last night  boy did you glee kids step in it  shue im afraid sue is right  you have indeed stepped in it  no i didnt even know this was going on  of course you didnt william  you wouldnt know if your glee club was using your office  to breed rabbits for pets or for food and you know why  youre too busy chasing tail and loading your hair  with enormous amounts of product  i mean today it just looks like you put lard in it  what are you even talking about  look look the kids did the commercial  to foster a feeling of unity after you  not anyone else you got them banned from the yearbook  thats what i did yes i admit it  it was an innocent mistake  and what if i were to just innocently murder you will  id still have to go to trial  probably get off with justifiable homicide  let me review the rules for you  william amendment 63 seventh addendum  no professional activity of any kind will be tolerated  and payment for services rendered negates amateur status  triggering immediate disqualification  hey hey hey hey keep it civil  hey what mister  no keep it simple folks  keep it simple  hey im sorry shue  but i cannot let this slide  but the kids werent even paid  theres a stack of mattresses in the choir room  piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles  in the dumpster outside your apartment  okay well give the mattresses back  shue one of those mattresses was used  you cant return a used mattress  you cant even donate one to charity  lice bedbugs i looked it up online  is there any reason that you have  a soiled mattress in your office will  have you and the redhead become so sexually depraved  that you have to commit your craven acts of adultery  in between classes  what  you know what okay fine  i slept here all right  excuse me  im thinking about leaving my wife  well i didnt see that one coming at all  william i am very sorry about your personal troubles  but my hands are tied  sues right you broke the rules  i cannot fight the scholastic board  im sorry but glee club is over  its over  dear journal  ive finally gotten will schuester  and that glee club out of my hair  this is a day that will live in infamy  once again ive won  miss sylvester  its like looking at a porno star in a nuns habit  i wanted to show you that it still fits  my baby bump isnt that bad  its just like i had a big lunch  take it off  you need to get it through your pregnant head  theres no way youre getting in that photo  or back on the cheerios  end of story  youre a hypocrite excuse me  i just heard that you got glee clubs  amateur status revoked over a mattress  while you are constantly  showering the cheerios with swag  ive gotten free shoes  complimentary tanning haircuts  the season tickets to cedar point  we sold those on ebay  for a profit  it seems to me that if figgins found out  you would get banned from competition  fine  youre back on the cheerios  ill put you on fulltime dry cleaning duty  and shove you to the back of the photo to hide your shame  im not finished  glee club gets a full page photo  thats not up to me  you are giving up one of the cheerios six pages  and you are giving it to the glee club free of charge  you know q id forgotten  just how ruthless you really are  youre like a young sue sylvester  now get out of my office  if you can manage to squeeze through the door  without your water breaking all over my new carpet  you know what  i dont think i want to be a cheerio after all  i dont want to be on a team where i only appear to belong  id rather be a part of a club thats proud to have me  like glee club  its my fault  if i hadnt slept on that mattress  we couldve just returned them and moved on  hey can i give you some advice  please  you need to give yourself a break  you do  youll figure out what to do with the kids you always do  but i think right now  you really need to focus on your own life  you know divorce is a really big deal  who said anything about getting a divorce  oh god im so sorry  i just assumed  that thats  is that what you would do  well um  when i first heard about  what terri had done  oh gosh no i thought there should be some sort of law  but then when i thought  about it some more  thought about what i wouldve done  if id felt you slipping away  you would never be that cruel  no her methods were wrong but um  i totally understand her intentions  youre a lot to lose will  but we dont want to go to sectionals without you  its without me or not at all  look i was the one who slept on the mattress  which means i accepted them not you  which means im disqualified from competition  not you guys  hes taking the bullet for us  solid  we have worked too hard  for you guys not to get your shot  we cant do this without you mr shue  hell we probably cant do it with you  thats not true  you guys are good  youre really good  you did jump for that commercial without me right  look the best teachers dont give you the answers  they just point the way and let you make your own choices  your own mistakes  that way you get all the glory  and you deserve it  look if if you cant win without me there  then i havent done my job  were really sorry mr shue  i know  i want you guys to go get gussied up  and take that glee club photo with pride  i want to see a smile on every one of your faces         smile though your heart is aching      smile even though its breaking      when there are clouds in the sky      youll get by      if you smile through your pain and sorrow      smile and maybe tomorrow      youll see the sun come shining through      for you      light up your face with gladness      hide every trace of sadness      although a tear      may be ever so near      thats the time      you must keep on trying      smile whats the use of crying      youll find that life is still worthwhile      if you just smile           smile though your heart is aching     is aching      smile even though its breaking     its breaking      when there are clouds in the sky      youll get by      thats the time you must keep on trying      smile whats the use of crying      youll find that life is still worthwhile      if you just smile      youll find that life is still worthwhile      if you just smile      smile
