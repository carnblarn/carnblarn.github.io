you son  tell you the truth im terrified  i dont know how to do this  no one does  look at me i was a mess  i worked all the time traveling  i was too strict  okay youre not instilling  with a great deal of confidence here dad  sighs  i mean im already up all night thinking about this  thats my fault the confidence thing  boys learn that from their fathers  i started at zuckerman and zuckerman in college  i needed some extra cash  i was saving up  for law school  but i never went  i never even applied  didnt have the balls  so i settled for insurance  i mean who was i to become a lawyer  you would have been a great one  youre the smartest guy i know  its not about brains son  being a good father hell being a man  is all about one thing  guts  and youve got about six months to figure out if you have any  will five six  seven eight step and step  step and step  and turn it around  down and up  and hit hit down hit  can we stop please  you dont have to ask me every time for permission to go  to the bathroom rachel you can just go  its not my bladder  its the choreography  okay whats wrong with the choreography  it sucks its completely unoriginal  are you guys going to get shunned for talking to me  sweetie were a team now  but youve got to do something about mr shues dance routines  we cant compete with vocal adrenaline with these steps  youre a great vocal coach mr shue  but youre not a a trained choreographer  thats what we need to be the best  we need dakota stanley  hes the best show choir choreographer in the midwest  we works with vocal adrenaline  you cant take regionals without him  he was the understudy to the candelabra  in beauty and the beast on broadway  just because he understudied doesnt mean he ever performed  did you ever perform mr schuester  after high school did you even try  will i wanted to that was my dream you know  ii just never had  the guts  they say it takes more certainty than talent to be a star  i mean look at um  look at john stamos  i dont know  i guess im also just nervous about being a dad  you know i want my kid to be proud of me  i want to set a good example you know  i  i hope its cool me unloading on you like this  i dont want there to be any awkwardness  oh no no none at all  i mean you know especially since  were um were both in relationships now  its both of us right  im in a relationship youre in a relationship  exactly yeah  hows it going with ken  great its great its wonderful  i mean you know heshes flawed  but hehe knows who he is and thatsthats great  and there really is  nothing sexier in a man than confidence you know  wry laugh   will sandy  i thought you werent allowed d wed on campus  no william im not allowed within 50 feet of children  besides henri and i go way back  i got him a job before we even had a shop class  i told figgins that you are going to have a school  full of nancies unless you get some hot wood  in those teenagers hands  here comes henri  ah shoot  terri was supposed to bring a cake  im back  will henri had a little problem  with overthecounter cough medicine  whirr crack  he ended up cutting off his thumbs  it was a real tragedy  ill never hitchhike across europe  that was a dream man  wheres terri  doing inventory  i cant count higher than 30  you know  this is nice i cant remember the last time  i just hung out with the guys  really talked about our feelings  want to know what im feeling  i live at the ymca i only have one pair of long pants  oh please my life is a disaster with no creative outlet  other than writing my desperate housewives fan fiction  im afraid of my vacuum  i know how you guys feel  i apparently dont know how to dance  i dont have thumbs  uh  sorry  henri sobbing  for hes a jolly good fellow   others join in harmonizing  for hes a jolly good fellow    for hes a jolly good fellow    that nobody can deny   sniffling  hey that was pretty good   this is how we do it   men beatboxing two weeks ago i would have agreed that four grown men  rehearsing a capella hiphop  in my living room was embarrassing  but busting out some whitehot new jack swing  ill tell u ive never felt more confident  testotertones was more manly  and then we heard a single word leave howards lips  and we knew we had our name  acafellas   yo we made it it feels so good   im ready for my closeup mr demille  sandy we voted when youre in the group its creepy  wait i   this is how we do it   man beatboxing   this is how we do it   will  if i dont get some sleep i could miscarry  im sorry terri ill be right in  i hope so  being in a boy band did wonders for our love life  seeing me feel so good about myself  made my wife more attracted to me in every way  sighs  it was amazing i mean we started doing it once a week  it was like she was trying to make a twin  groans  bell ringing  hes not coming  what happened  theyre my famous sugar cookies  i bake them for the poor during christmastime  but i whipped up a special batch  just for you  i wanted to say how sorry i was for what i said  dont be you were right  you know the truth is rachel if you werent so hard on me  i never would have had the guts to start acafellas  but we need you mr shue  youve missed six rehearsals in the past couple of weeks  and when youre there youre not really there  which is why i think you should go ahead and hire montana  dakota whatever  you know  ill still be there to help you guys sing and stuff  but uh i just dont have time for all of it anymore  of course he doesnt want  anything to do with us after you kicked him in the nads  then why did he thank me  santana the goal is to win  and now that mr schuester has agreed  to let us hire dakota stanley  we can  but he doesnt want us to he just doesnt have  the confidence to coach us anymore  guys are real sensitive when it comes to this kind of stuff  and thats my fault  do you see anyone else in here  with a plate of im sorry cookies  i dont just you  im bored  all those in favor of hiring dakota stanley  bell ringing  hey wait up  you cant do this to mr schuester  what make him a hero  once we hire dakota and win nationals  hell thank me for it  you heard santana its all about winning  since when  look you have your popular clique and your football  and your clich of a blond girlfriend  glee is my one shot  if this doesnt work out then my whole high school life  will be nothing but an embarrassment  whats a clich is that a bad thing  wait wait wait wait wait  where youre pissed about one thing  but youre just pretending  like youre pissed about something else  cause  i dont know what youre talking about  well for a while there you were kind of all over me  and now you just yell at me all the time  it makes me think that youre still upset  about what happened in the auditorium  im not  ive moved on and im focusing on my career now  so you want to talk about it no  and neither do you  its kind of ironic how youre mr popular  and im just this nobody that everybody makes fun of  but i have enough confidence to say out loud  that what happened between us in the auditorium was real  you have feelings for me  and you just dont have the guts to admit it  were hiring dakota stanley  even if it means me quitting  yes  its a good start  youre sewing the seeds of destruction  mr schuester barely even shows up for rehearsals  oh no no no  barely will not cut it  i will not be satisfied until glee club is disbanded  and what about this dakota character  any chance he actually helps  theyre soft  hell eat them alive  i give them 15 minutes before the first one quits  or tries to commit suicide  you know ladies  i learned a lot in special forces  i was on the strike team in panama  when we extracted noriega  we took out the shepherd  then we went after the sheep  you need to go after these glee clubbers  one by one  i want my full budget restored  i need a fog machine  have you ever kissed anybody  yes  if by someone you mean the tender crook of my elbow  no i havent  but i want to  all right stop it right there mercedes  we are in glee club  that means we are at the bottom of the social heap  special ed kids will get
