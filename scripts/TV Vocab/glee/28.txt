with me i wont get mad  at you if you tell me the truth  ill be relieved  really because it looks like youre gonna be mad  no matter what i say  you said another womans name while you were kissing me  look i get it  shes in a position of power over you  which can be exciting and you clearly  like women who give you a hard time  im not cheating on you with my football coach  look can we talk about this in private  why am i embarrassing you its not what you think  what i think is that im not putting out for you  so youre getting it wherever you can  including the locker room with the beiste  whats this  this is a lovers quarrel and is your fault  watch your tone with me missy  you crap on my leg ill cut it off  ill leave you two  everything okay  stay away from my woman  what hells going on around here  whats going on sam  how many of the guys have done this  all the guys whose girlfriends wont put out  its the girls too  this is really bad guys  what if coach beiste were to find out about it  think about how hurt shed be  its not personal  of course its personal  look coach beiste  is like us like glee club  shes an outsider at this school  no one appreciates her or her talent  because theyve decided that shes too different  and for you guys to abuse that even in private  is the opposite of everything were trying to achieve in here  but were just thinking about it  its not like were actually you know  making fun of her to her face  i need you to stop  and spread the word to all the other glee guys and girls  this ends here and now  and coach beiste can never know about this  okay  sorry  bell rings  blaine latte thank you  this is wes  and david  its very civilized  for you to invite me for coffee  before you beat me up for spying  we are not going to beat you up you were such a terrible spy  we thought it was sort of endearing  which made me think that spying on us  wasnt really the reason you came  can i ask you guys a question  are you guys all gay  laughter  blaine uh uh no  i mean i am but these two have girlfriends  this is not a gay school  we just have a zerotolerance  harassment policy  everybody gets treated the same no matter what they are  its pretty simple  would you guys excuse us  yeah take it easy kurt  i take it youre having trouble at school  im the only person out of the closet at my school  and ii i tried to stay strong about it  but theres this neanderthal whos made it his mission  to make my life a living hell  and nobody seems to notice  i know how you feel  i got taunted at my old school  and it really pissed me off  i even complained about it to the faculty  and they were sympathetic and all but you could just tell that  nobody really cared  it was like  hey if youre gay your lifes just gonna be miserable  sorry nothing we can do about it  so i left and i came here  simple as that  so you have two options  i mean id love to tell you to just come enroll here  but tuition at daltons sort of steep and i know  thats not an option for everybody  or  you can refuse to be the victim  prejudice is just ignorance kurt  and you have a chance  right now to teach him  how  confront him  call him out  i ran kurt  i didnt stand up  i let bullies chase me away  and it is something that i really really regret  bell rings  the boys beat us the last time we competed against them  weve got to bring the noise hard this time  quinn to be fair they didnt officially beat us  we got busted for vitamin d possession before the vote  wait somethings definitely wrong  why isnt rachel talking yeah she should  totally be bossing us around right now  the idea of the assignment was to do the opposite  or what we normally do  im just trying to stick to the lesson plan which is  proving nearly impossible  since youre gluing those sequins on backwards  spies  lighten up were here  to talk to santana and brittany  puck quietly remember dont trust your instincts  hmm so how does it feel to be a free man  all i can say is that i dont want  a longterm relationship with either of you  especially brittany since im not in love with her  do you guys want to go out to dinner tonight  not really  oh tell you what
