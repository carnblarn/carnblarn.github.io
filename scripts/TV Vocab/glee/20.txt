                ppened last wills old rival bryan ryan  tried to cancel the club youre done here  then he was really into it     then he tried to cancel it again  you think youre helping these kids  when all youre doing is setting them up to be jaded and bitter  finns moms dating kurts dad which was totally part of  kurts plan to get closer to finn  when will you learn that nothing is impossible  when it comes to love artie told tina  what his greatest dream was then realized  that not every dream is achievable  is that even a word achievable  achievatate achievalize  okay you just said like ten offensive things  jessie pushed rachel to find out who her mom was  and it turns out its shelby corcoran  the coach of vocal adrenaline i want a look thats so optimistic  it could cure cancer geez and thats  what you missed on glee  am i in trouble  come on youve got more selfesteem than that  i think this might have something to do with  your perfect attendance last semester  no miss cohenchang is in trouble  it has come to my attention that the look you sport  is what is known as goth american teens are coming down  with a serious case of twilight fever  transformed from normal children  into vampires obsessed with the occult  and only yesterday this dark specter reared its head  at mckinley high  this is totally going to get robert pattinsons attention    oh hey    oh dear god  i dont mean to state the obvious  but you do know that vampires arent real right  they dont exist  william denial will not make this problem go away  my parents wont even let me watch twilight  my mom says she thinks kristin stewart seems like a bitch  this is a serious problem  miss cohenchang youve got to find yourself  another style of dress hold on a second  tina is shy  and one way shes found to express herself  is through her clothes  high school is an incredibly important time  when kids get to explore who they are  when i was in high school i had a whole year where i dressed  exactly like kurt cobain i mean come on  there has to be someone who you used to dress like  yes for several years in my early 20s  i dressed up as elvis but he was a christian will  and he did not possess the ability to transform into a bat   i think he thinks vampires are real  i think youre right  studies have shown that a strict dress code fosters  a safe and stable learning environment  with fewer instances of gang violence and vampirism  so if i see you dressed in lacy demon clothes again  tina cohenchang   you will be suspended   step couple more  is there a car down here from me  honey were indoors  oh okay  and open your eyes  sparkling cider yeah  welcome home but who went somewhere  burt asked us to move in with them and this is how youre telling me  the party is my idea  if youre gonna say something say it loud right  burt yeah its gonna take some getting used to but trust me  youre gonna love it okay  now you dont have to drag your tail over here  every time you want to watch something on the old 55incher  we got a lot of food some ethnic food its some ethnicity  thats not ours tuna crudits tuna crudits its not ethnic  here you go  carole finn this house is twice as big  as ours it has two bathrooms  two and a half  i dont want an extra bathroom or a tuna crude  i just want my house back  i think i know what this resistance is about  our room and i couldnt agree more  the palate in here is totally unflattering to your skin tone  not everyone can pull off dior gray  we need to redecorate wait were sharing a room  im not cool with that  carole baby i know its weird okay  but cant be much of a surprise  and in time youre gonna be as happy as i am  yeah look ill knock out a wall upstairs  ill put an addition on okay  butbut until then maybe this will  grease the wheels a bit huh  oh hey  look thats 300 oh my have at it  you redecorate this place  dont worry roomie  mr ikea catalog and i will have this all figured out  i am going to  put together a palate that expresses  who you are and who i want you to be  who you want to be hey what nights game night  you play sorry  you know he will now   i will  sorry  i will beat you its so weird  this so isnt you  i feel like an asian branch davidian  tina are there any other looks you can try  biker chick cowgirl  hood rat computer programmer  crosscountry skier catholic schoolgirl  happy meal no onions or a chicken  look i appreciate it guys but it just isnt me  i know who i am and im not  allowed to show it its like communism  guys we have a serious problem  you know how ive been doing  some deep background on vocal adrenaline  isnt that against the rules no not at all  or probably whatever  anyway what i figured out i rooted through the dumpsters  behind the carmel auditorium and i found  of christmas lights  oh no  which led me to joelle fabrics  i asked them about red chantilly lace  they were sold out oh sweet jesus  oh my wait what   theyre doing gaga  thats it its over  exactly we should have guessed it  theyre going for fullout theatricality  they know its the easiest way to beat us damn them  whats up with this gaga dude  he just like dresses weird right like bowie   lady gaga is a woman  shes only the biggest pop act  to come along in decades shes boundarypushing  the most theatrical performer of our generation  and she changes her look  faster than brit changes sexual partners  thats true  artie it makes sense that  vocal adrenaline would pay homage  its a brilliant move shes a perfect fit  for them hold on a second  we might be able to kill two birds with one stone here  we can help tina  find a new look and nd  a competitive number for regionals  this week your assignment  gaga   rachel pens we need pens  my ideas just come to me uh my office  right there im brainstorming its coming  and claw claw uh clap clap  and five six seven eight  one two three four think they can see us   if they catch us  are we gonna have to go to jail  stealing their ideas is not a crime  shelby six seven eight and one two  your shoes are making noise  and five six seven eight  and one two three four five six and seven  they look amazing claw claw uh clap clap  and five six uh uh okay okay okay just  enough  you guys arent getting it  your letting the costumes do all the work  theatricality isnt about crazy outfits  its not enough to douse yourselves with gasoline  you have to light yourselves on fire to make it work  god shes good but being theatrical  doesnt mean you have to be a nuclear explosion  it can be like like a quiet storm you just have to radiate emotion  express whats deep inside you  thats what theatricality is truly about  do i have to demonstrate funny girl e flat   barbra streisands funny girl   exactly what i would have done barbra  i could do it in my sleep    funny      did you hear that      funny      yeah the guy said honey      youre a funny girl      thats me      i just keep them in stitches      doubled in half      and though i may be      all wrong for the guy      im good for a laugh      i guess its not funny      life is far from sunny     where are you going  get back here    when the laugh is over      and the jokes on you      a girl ought to have      a sense of humor      thats one thing      you really need for sure      when youre a funny girl      the fella said a funny girl      funny      how it aint so funny      funny girl    ms corcoran  im rachel berry im your daughter  did you ever regret it yes  then no then so much  wwhen did you realize it was the right time for me to find you    i saw you sing at sectionals you were extraordinary  you were me    was it hard for you to not become a star  to not have your dreams come true it felt like a broken promise  like the fisher kings wound never heals  wow genetics really are amazing  you see the world with the same fierce theatricality as i do  even the way were sitting right now is so dramatic  and yet we feel so comfortable with it  ive missed so much how do you feel  thirsty  when i was little and i used to get sad  my dads would bring me a glass of water  it got so i couldnt tell if i was sad  or just thirsty  i shouldnt have done this  this was supposed to feel good  wwe were supposed to have some kind of  slowmotion run into each others arms  this is all wrong  maybe we can just go to dinner or something  just to get over the initial shock  im so sorry rachel  uh ill ill call you  oh hey finn come on in  im learning all this amazing stuff about lady gaga  shes got this thing called the haus of gaga which is  like this collective of artists and designers  who collaborate on on her styles  and stage sets and her music  i think its an exciting model  for what we could be doing in glee club  yeah thats kind of what i wanted to talk to you about  i dont want to do lady gaga  and i suspect that with the exception of kurt  that none of the other guys are gonna want to do it either  i just feel like were always doing whatever the girls want us to do  yeah  yeah youre right  maybe i havent been listening to you guys hard enough  so lets find a solution  well i uh i actually already have one  youre wrong  its a really good name its a rock star name  you want to name our daughter jack daniels  shes a girl  okay fine whatever jackie daniels  the name is not the point i told you this  im giving up the baby  so i dont have to do this with you  this is good for you  now you can go off and be a rock star yourself  i love wearing champagne bubbles  i get to express a whole different side of myself  because even though im painfully shy  and obsessed with death im a really effervescent person  excuse me were you dropped on your heads  what was that i think you heard me  im just saying  pick on me thats fine but dont throw around a girl  well you know lately  we havent been able to tell the difference  were not gaga for gaga you dress all freaky  and then you rub it in everybodys faces  i dont want to look at it all day  its weird it makes my eyes tired  if you want to switch it up a bit  just go from gap to banana republic  its called being theatrical were showing off who you are  its the same thing you do when you go to school  with your football uniforms on  youre expressing yourself and we have every right  to do the same well you know what  the next time you want to express yourself  a little like a circus freak dont be shocked when my fist  feels like expressing itself against your chin  okay  knock that crazy fool crepepaper nonsense offa you  lets go yeah you dont want to be late for  your appointment at supercuts  watch your mouth homo  and you know what fancy you dont need  an appointment at supercuts they love walkins       little monsters take a bow   all right ladies kurt i am really really impressed  sientete you know you know what the best part is  each one of those costumes shows off a different aspect  of  your personalities wait wheres rachel

right  oh well then its definitely not gay huh  get out of my way  man how many times do we got go through this  you being a jock and being in this glee club  does not make you versatile it makes you bisexual  and if we have to kick your ass  to make you understand that  then our schedules are wide open  get out of my bathroom  you girls yall belong across the hallway  glee boy          yeah thats better guys take five  and ladies i dont want to hear about chafing  just because youre being forced to wear metal underwear  not my problem  mom  hon you gotta stop sneaking into these rehearsals

think youre gonna find it    girls whoo   you got to treat yourself like number one      do you need to be reminded      need to be reminded    whoo   it doesnt matter what you do or say      just forget the things that youve been told      we cant do it any other way      everybodys got to rock and roll      oh oh oh ooh       shout it shout it      shout it out loud      shout it shout it      shout it out loud      if you dont feel good      theres a way you could      dont sit there brokenhearted      sit there brokenhearted      call all your friends in the neighborhood      and get the party started      get the party started      dont let em tell you that theres too much noise      theyre too old to really understand        youll still get rowdy      with the girls and boys      cause its time for you to take a stand      yeah yeah      yeah shout it shout it      shout it out loud      you got to have a party      shout it shout it      shout it out loud      turn it up louder      shout it shout it      shout it out loud      oh yeahyeah      shout it shout it      shout it out loud      hear it getting louder      shout it shout it      shout it out loud        all right guys very impressive  very very loud   but what uh what does that performance express  and what do those costumes illustrate  we did our research mr shue  yeah finns demon look  is because gene simmons liked comic books as a kid  and they called paul stanley the star child  because he was a romantic or something  but that doesnt really explain my whore lips  and my ace frehley is supposed  to be a spaceman from another planet  mikes iconic catman  is because peter criss claimed to have nine lives  yeah and im dressed as the guy who replaced artie when he quit  well congratulations guys job well done  lets give it up for the boys    i thought the boys kiss number was good  although the lyrics did leave something to be desired  and finn kept sticking his tongue out  and i couldnt stop picturing him licking stuff  it was disturbing  we warned you  now gagas got to go  could you have a word with azimio and karofsky  about harassing me without damaging my gaga outfit  are you serious  do you know how difficult it is with those guys  they already think were boyfriends  let them think what they want  theyre neanderthals  in three years theyll be cleaning my septic tank  dont you get it its not just them  we live in ohio  not new york or san francisco or some other city  where people eat vegetables that arent fried  i dont understand why you always need  to make such a big spectacle  of yourself  why cant you just work harder at blending in  im sure thatd be easier for you  you know it would  you are such a boy  youre going to have to use a moist towelette  if you want to get that makeup off  dont touch me  what is your problem finn  its just a moist towelette  im gonna finish in the laundry room  grow up finn  i know why you called and dont worry about it  my reconnection with rachel is not some kind of plot  to mess with you guys before regionals  im not worried about regionals  its rachel  shes special  shes got all of the best of you  shes strongwilled dramatic  wildly talented  go on  but shes not hard like you  shes fragile  overemotional  and shes clearly convinced herself  that you are as committed to this reunion  as she is  and i dont think you are  youre not prepared to have  a teenage daughter  are you  i cant have any more kids  there were issues  a few years back  then some surgery and thats that  i really wanted a daughter  thats why it was so important to me  to make that bond with her  but youre right  i wanted my baby back  rachels an adult now  she doesnt need me  shelby  i cant tell you what to do  but if you really love her  you have to tell her  what you just told me  kurt i had to skip school to finish it  but i think youre really going to like it  consider it a peace offering after all the yelling  that weve been doing  i used marlene dietrich and gary cooper in morocco  as my inspiration  its a perfect blend of the masculine and the feminine  the muted and the theatrical  are you freaking insane  i cant live here im a dude  what the hell is that  supposed to be  its a privacy partition  its all i could find on such short notice  why are you getting angry about everything  i worked hard on thi  thats not a privacy partition  why is it so hard for you  to understand  i dont want to get dressed in front of you  do you know that  i put my underwear on in the shower  before i come out when youre around  i just i dont want to have to worry  about that kind of stuff in my own room man  and what stuff are you referring to  you know you know what im talking about  dont play dumb  why cant you just accept that im not like you  i have accepted that no you havent  you think i dont see the way you stare at me  how flirty you get  you think i dont know why you got so excited  that we were going to be moving in together  its just a room finn  we can redecorate it if you want to  okay good  well then the first thing that needs to go  is that faggy lamp  and then we need to get rid of this faggy couch cover  hey  what did you just call him  oh no no i didnt call him anything  i was talking to the blanket  if you use that word youre talking about him  relax dad i didnt take it that way  yeah thats because youre 16  and you still assume the best in people  you live a few years  you start seeing the hate in peoples hearts  even the best people  you use the n word  of course not  how about retard  you call that nice girl in cheerios with kurt you call her a retard  becky no shes my friend shes got down syndrome  id never call her that thats cruel  but you think its okay to come into my house  and say faggy  thats not what i meant i know what you meant  what you think i didnt use that word when i was your age  you know some kid  gets clocked in practice  wed tell him to stop being such a fag  shake it off  we meant it exactly  the way you meant it  that being gay is wrong  that its some kind  of punishable offense  i really thought you were different finn  you know i thought that being in glee club  and being raised by your mom  meant that you were some you know  new generation of dude who saw things differently  who just kind of you know came into the world  knowing what has taken me years of struggling  to figure out  i guess i was wrong  im sorry finn but you cant you cant stay here  dad  i love your mom  and maybe this is going to cost me her  but my family comes first  i cant have that kind of poison around  this is our home kurt  he is my son  out in the world you do what you want  but not under my roof  the place looks great   you should be in orbit  my balls keep fallinoff  been there  i want to talk about this  theres not much to say  i feel sorry for you i thought you were different  i am different  will all right lets get things started  mr shue  theres something i want to say to quinn  and i want everybody to hear it  all right  at first i didnt really get this theatrical assignment  being larger than life and putting it all out there  cause im kind of like that all the time  thats how my dad was too  he was too busy being all crazy and rock and roll  to be there for his kid  and you know what  i didnt care that my dad was a badass  i just wanted him to be there  and he never was  and then i learned  all this kiss stuff  and while jackie daniels is a great name for like  a powerboat or something its not right for a baby girl  so if my kiss mates  will help me out i got a better idea  grab a stool guys      beth i hear you calling      but i cant come home right now      me and the boys are playing      and we just cant find the sound      just a few more hours      and ill be right home to you      i think i hear them calling      oh beth what can i do      beth what can i do      you say you feel so empty      that our house just aint our home      im always somewhere else      and youre always there alone      just a few more hours      and ill be right home to you      i think i hear them calling      oh beth what can i do      beth what can i do      beth i know youre lonely      and i hope youll be all right      cause me and the boys will be playing all night      all night    i know youre giving her up  but before you do i think you should name her beth  if youll let me  id really like to be there when shes born  id really like to meet her  so howd your dads come up with the name rachel  they were um big friends fans  i know why youre here  to say goodbye  i really wanted this to work  do you know what really turned me  that story that you told me about your dads  and how theyd bring you water  when you were sad  were never gonna have anything like that  its too late for us  i just think that anything we share right now  is gonna be confusing for you  i just dont understand  youre my mom  i feel awful right now and i should want  to just fall into your arms and let you rock me  and tell me everything is gonna be fine but  i just dont feel it  its because im your mother but im not your mom  so what do we just pretend we dont know each other now  that seems silly  lets just be grateful for one another  from afar  for a while  dont think for a second im gonna  go soft on you during regionals   bring it   can i have a hug goodbye  sure    can you do me one more favor  sometime when youre thirsty  can you get yourself some water from this cup  gold stars are kinda my thing  of course   shelby  before you go will  will you sing with me  just one time  its sort of a fantasy of mine  and it would really mean a lot to me  i would be honored  brad  hes always just around  um take that
