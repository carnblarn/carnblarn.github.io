time  well you know what your problem is  no tryouts  just sign up  nobody wants to be  part of a club that just anyone can join  see this  its a court summons child endangerment  cause theres been a line of wouldbe cheerios  out there since late july  i guess they lost their humanity a little bit  one girl ate a pigeon several others  started worshipping a possum carcass as their lord  thats how much they want to be cheerios  well sorry sue  anyone who wants to join glee club gets to join  oh god will let me break it down for you  high school is a dry run for the rest of your life  not everyone can be champions  not everyone should be champions  we need fry cooks and bus drivers  well sue its how i work and its not going to change  i like being friends with you will  this is fun

oh sue i think you can manage  a sixth national title without two confetti cannons  do you think your kids can manage life without their daddy  were barely surviving on the budget we have  slashing the glee budget  by ten percent  cutting our transportation to and from events  is like cutting our legs off  sacrifices must be made  this is being mandated at the district level guys  studies show that the best way to bring in alumni donations  is through a successful athletic department  specifically  a winning football team whos this  im shannon beiste im the new football coach  spelled beiste  its french will im sorry  what happened to ken tanaka  nervous breakdown  dont look at it  as a punishment  look at it as an investment into your clubs futures  the more money the football program  brings in the more i can give back to you guys  coach beiste here  is fresh off her fifth consecutive  allmissouri high school  football championship  were very lucky to have her  what can i say i like a challenge  first of all  a female football coach like a male nurse  sin against nature  number two im sure youre used to hillbilly parents  yelping adulation at you as they attempt  to impregnate the tailpipes of various offroad vehicles  but youre in my house now beiste  no one comes into my house and steals from me  do not get up in a panthers business lady  youre all coffee and no omelet  whispers that doesnt make any sense  coach uh beiste ii think you understand our frustration  our budgets just got cut by ten percent  it should have been more  you think theres not something wrong when  the cheerleaders budgets higher than the people  who theyre cheering for  well sure but the glee club is a  the glee club you came in third last year  and youre asking for more money  thats a steer with six teats and no oink  squeals  whispers this doesnt make any sense  what  school bell ringing  these are comments  from jacob benisraels  most recent glee club blog  glee is a giant ball of suck  we get it mr shue everyone still hates us  so what so were plankton on the high school food chain  only difference now is that none of us really care  kurts right were a family they can bring it all they want  none of it is going to break us  okay im really happy that you guys have all bonded  the problem is that all of this negative stuff  is keeping other students from auditioning  good why do we need new members  well since matt transferred  we only have 11 members  and if we want to go to nationals  if we want to beat vocal adrenaline  we have to go from a small rebel force  to a giant wall of sound  yeah mr schuesters right you guys  you didnt see vocal adrenaline at regionals they were epic  were going to need more voices in order to beat them  yeah im with rachel on this one  gross  youre going to have to trust me on this guys  now heres the plan  nationals are in new york this year  and we are going laughs  now lets go out there  and show the school

what im into  like his abs  dude im sympathetic for you  i just dont see you on the football team  imagine you were pushing me in this big hunk of metal  down the field at full speed  the centrifugal force would be too much to stop  id be like a medieval  battering ram  dude youd be like a human cannonball  that would be awesome  so youll help  sure but you got to help me first  hey sam  my names

and is very unnerving  okay so im gonna go now  wait  and  she has a remarkable voice  sighs  im just  im very worried  you know notnot for myself  but for my lesser glee clubbers who dont get as many solos  so ive paid a hundred dollars to azimio and karofsky  to brutally slushie us in front of sunshines locker  terrifying her and ensuring she doesnt sign up  okay so this is the part where youre supposed to be  hugging me and thanking me  thats awful youre awful  but solos i mean  look rachel mercedes and i are about as selfinvolved  as they come but more than anything  we want to beat vocal adrenaline  and if theres someone at the school that can help us do that  theyre in  you know what  youre right  its just  so like me to just be  totally blinded by my concern for the two of you  illillill go talk to sunshine now  and just let her know how truly welcome she really is  thanks  school bell ringing  hi  so heres the address for the audition tomorrow  and helpful directions  look

distracting  i cant take my eyes off them  im actually talking to them  right now  i wanted people to notice me more  i dont get what the big deal is  well the big deal is that a person  who has to pump her nonnies full of gravy  to feel good about herself clearly doesnt have  the selfesteem to be my head cheerleader  quinn will replace you  what did stammers  oh and boobs mcgee  youre demoted to the bottom of the pyramid  so when it collapses your exploding  sandbags will protect the squad from injury  now take your juicy  vineripened chest fruit  and get the hell out of my office

us on the doll  where coach beiste touched you  here and here  this is outrageous  ill say  anyone who would prey on someone  as sweet and simple as poor poor brittany  deserves everything thats coming to her  i suggest immediate termination and entry into the statewide  sex offender database  sorry im late  whats going on  brittany here has accused coach beiste  of inappropriate touching  what brittany thats a serious accusation  its very serious  brittany what youre saying could ruin somebodys life  its really important that you tell the truth here  i made it up  coach beiste didnt touch my boobs  sighs  actually i really want to touch her boobs  beiste if youre all done  wasting my time i have a football team to coach  coach  school bell ringing  youre weak will  you know what

homemade cookies  oh those smell like dog poop  are those dog poop cookies  no thats the flaxseed oil youre smelling  these are hearthealthy cookies for some of our  burlier americans  sue were not
