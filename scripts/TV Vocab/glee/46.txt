                1 so here is what you missed on glee quinns got a new look  and a new crowd of skanks kurt got blaine to join  the new directions which is good because santana got  kicked out and sugar motta wasnt good enough to get in who cares what you think  mckinleys doing west side story and kurt and rachel  need the leads so they can get into nyada  sues using her run for congress  to come after the arts believe it or not  still not a big fan of the glee club  and thats what you missed on glee  school bell ringing  i really like your outfit  and i think youre like fabulous  and i just love everything that you do  why thank you brit  okay i really want to run your campaign for president  out of all the kids at the school i think that you  are the biggest unicorn im sorry  well when a pony does a good deed he gets a horn  and he he becomes a unicorn and he poops out cotton candy  until he forgets hes magical  and then his horn falls off  and black unicorns they becomes zebras  oh thats thats a terrifying story  no its not  no okay no  the point is is that  a unicorn is sebody who knows theyre magical  and isnt afraid to show it  you went through hell last year  and you never forgot how special you were  and ive slept with a lot of people and am really popular  so i think i could get you mega votes  then why dont you just run  im not smart enough  whats the capital of ohio  brittany o  mrs hagberg what  do you even know who the president is  william  laughing  well brit i have to say that im im flattered  and really excited  cool okay ill come over after school  and well work on your campaign posters  i got a lot of great ideas  great great uh ill see you then  sweet   school bell ringing all right new directions  big news as you all know  vocal adrenaline came in second last year at nationals  the only good thing to come out of that lost weekend  besides us getting back together  well the boosters at carmel  dont donate tens of thousands of dollars  every year to come in second  so they fired dustin goolsby so handsome  and theyre having trouble finding a new coach  seems that no one wants to take on that pressure cooker  that means theyre vulnerable  yes and if we work hard enough we can beat them  which is why ive realized that um  i cant direct the musical this year  but mr shue you cant cancel the musical  my new york dreams depend on it  im not cancelling it im just not directing it  my sole focus has to be in here  nationals nationals nationals  and its not just me thats going to have to  focus harder this year ive been too easy on you  so every day after choir practice  im instituting a mandatory booty camp  so that we can work on our dancing  now its not for all of you just the people that  i think need help like  finn how did you know  and puckerman hummel i must protest  you kind of have one move kurt its like this  sashay and its super distracting  jones what  hell to the nizzyno you told me once you were beyonce  you dont think she spends extra time in the dance studio  mike chang has offered to be my assistant  and we start tomorrow and yes puckerman it is mandatory  mr schuester would you mind if i dropped by for a little bit  i really need to catch up with you guys rachel okay mr shue im glad  that youre so concerned with our special needs members  but what about me okay whos going to direct the musical  ladies and gentleman your comusical directors  ms pillsbury and coach beiste  now ms pillsbury did such a good job helping me out  with rocky horror last year that  i knew she could handle the job  and im here to keep the football guys in line  ive also talked them into playing the jets  mr shue with all due respect to ms pillsbury  and coach beiste this is crazy they have absolutely  zero experience in directing a musical not true  in college i was in a funny thing happened  on the way to the forum i played the forum  the teachers at this school  are already overworked and  unfortunately a lot of them agree with sue that  the arts are a waste of time  besides they are going to have some help  ive decided to include a student director this year  mr shue im honored but barbra was 40  when she directed herself in yentl so its just  its too soon i hate you  i was actually hoping that artie would take the job  me  ive developed my whole persona around conflict avoidance  come on artie youve made short films  directing is your dream you can do it  im in  cheering clapping all right  school bell ringing  you still make a mean cup of coffee  shelby  what are you what are you doing here  its the teachers lounge isnt it  its where all the teachers hang out  yeah  im a teacher here now  well parttime  you ever hear of this guy named al motta  mr motta just so im clear  in exchange for this very generous donation  all i have to do is hire ms corcoran to start a second  show choir at mckinley which features your daughter  for which i will cover any and all expenses  my sugars a super nova figgy  you have a deal mrs dennybrown  mr motta has just ended our toilet paper shortage  with this enormous check  wipe away  they actually sent a headhunter to track me down in new york  apparently i am the best show choir director money can buy  dont worry im not going to poach any of your kids  im less worried about that than about the fact that  you being here is going to be really hard on rachel  i appreciate that  i plan on reaching out to her  what about puck and quinn  limas where i made a series of mistakes  that defined me for 16 years  limas where i i have to make things right again  i know that seems impossible but i have to try  okay  i will take you at your word  but as for your little glee club  the more arts at this school the better  so may the best glee club win  we will  give us your lunch money  were hungry we need something to barf back up  dont test me  i was a foster kid which means im used to stabbing people  youre so mean  thats right its what passed for love in my house  skanks ive got to talk to that lady alone  first of all smoking kills  second it really does make you look cooler doesnt it  sorry coach  but you have no power over me anymore  cause ive got nothing left to lose  oh q i look at you and im stunned  youve never looked worse  youve lost your child your boyfriend your rep  and worse your high pony you know who i blame  the glee club  you know when you were in my grasp  you were at the top of the pyramid  but then you joined the glee club and became lost  forced to sway in the background  will schuester never did appreciate the gentle tremble  of your thin forgettable alto  thanks  what if i were to offer you the chance  to get revenge on the glee club and become a star  my congressional campaign is producing a video  a day in the life of a girl from whom the arts stole everything  and i think ive found my girl  first a few demands  i need thrift store couches under the bleachers  ive realized that after smoking all day  it hurts to stand  fair enough  quinn fabray you have a deal  okay were going to make  of each poster and then  well ve each student a swag bag full of this  were going to call it kurt hummels bulging pink fun sack  well i you know i dont know what to say  that happens to me all the time  my lips move but only dust comes out  you know i appreciate the enthusiasm  but you know its just all wrong  i think its just you know a tad too  unicorn gay  i feel like i might as well have a big  neon sign above my head that says you know  gaydiddygay gay gaygaygay i mean youll need a long extension cord  but i love it im joking  well next time you make a joke  nudge me in the ribs or like honk a horn or something  look i dont just want to be known as you know  kurt hummel homo  whats wrong with that  look 99 of the kids at the school  are either freaks or closet freaks  the captain of the football squad he gets the job  but he doesnt represent the people  thats why we need a unicorn  and i agree with the sentiment  i just want something you know toned down a tad  i came up with a campaign poster too  okay okay  tada hmm  its understated yet elegant  inspired of course by the classic blackglama fur coat ads  rumor has it that judy garland  down on her luck and thin as a baby bird  stole her blackglama mink coat after her photo shoot  and it wasnt even lined yet  you should tell that story during your campaign speech  its like so unicorn  i dont have time for this  gotta meet the skanks on the roof  gonna throw ketchupcovered tampons at the marching band  youre back yeah i went to new york  thought id do it all the whole working mother thing  but when i was in rehearsal even even performing  i couldnt stop thinking about beth  how i could miss her milestones you know  her first steps first words  first arabesque i get it  so when i got this job offer i couldnt refuse  ive missed so many firsts in rachels life  i was not about to do that with beth  neat story  but im late for a meeting on the roof  quinn just listen to her hey look  since the day that i gave rachel up for adoption  i have been walking through life  searching for her face everywhere i go  imagining what shes doing what she may be like  i dont want you to go through what i went through  part of me isis back here because  because i want you to get to know beth  i want you to be a part of her life  when do i get to see her  are you okay whats going on with you  are you even in glee anymore  did you come here just to torment me  with the idea of seeing my child  look i want you to be a part of beths life  but not like this  if youre really serious about beth  clean up your act you think you can tell me what to do  just cause you signed a couple of papers  youre not her mom im her mom  quinn me so  you can pretend all you want  but that is something you are never going to be    mercedes listen mr shue im all for participating  but shay says im more of a park and bark  and i tend to agree  a what and what  park and bark i stand center stage  singing the notes no one else can  while all of you guys dance around me  booty camp is about all of you dancing mercedes  in unison  i mean look at vocal adrenaline  when theyre in synch one big terrifying machine  theyre unstoppable  mike do your thing lets go  the jazz square the grapevine

bushel  if only to shine brighter for the auditions tomorrow  blaine im still trying to decide  between maria and somethings coming  those are tony songs are you auditioning for tony too  would that be weird no no not at all  youd be a great tony  be the perfect tony actually in some respects  mike finn you look like youre stepping on bees  come on mercedes blend  well except im a junior  tonys

hands fine  bell ringing  singing scales  laahahahahah    singing higher scale  laahahahahah    laah   your range is better  it was impressive a year and a half ago  but its even better now  this is a private rehearsal  what song are you auditioning with  thats none of your business okay if youve come here  to ask me to join your little group the answer is no  my loyalty is to the new directions  theyre my family  and family means something at least to me  rachel like we talked about before im your birth mother  yeah but not my mother i know okay  i almost had to go to therapy because of you rachel  look iill be polite okay dont worry if i see you  in the halls il make eye contact and ill nod  now if youll excuse me  i have to get back to my rehearsal  somewhere theres a place for us  i just said that there wasnt im talking about the song  i played maria 18 times  somewhere is the perfect audition song for you  you should do it  well i was considering it  but its a very challenging song so  i was just going to do i feel pretty  which im actually amazing at  you will never become a star or get the lead  if you play it safe  try it  intro to somewhere playing  theres a place for us   somewhere a place for us   peace and quiet and open air   wait for us somewhere   theres a time for us   someday a time for us   time together with time to spare   time to learn   time to care

whole puerto rican thing  but we do have mercedes jones coming in  for my money she has the most soulful voice here at mckinley  yeah shes not white either which i like for maria  so well keep an open mind  okeydoke  um kurt hummel for tony  i mean lets talk about  star quality shall we kurt was awesome  no question  he owned that song like it was his prison bitch  my thing is tonys supposed to be from the streets  hes the leader of the jets  an alpha gang member  i look at kurt and i dont believe it  emma well respectfully coach tonys retired from the jets  hes a poet of the urban jungle  there is a delicate wholesomeness to kurt  thats unexpected but not unwelcome for tony  i mean if i were maria id love to be held  in kurts toothpick arms on my fire escape  beiste listen i love the kid  but i want a tony that excites my lady parts  hummels too much of a lady  emma well artie you know him best  could kurt you know could he pass  artie im a firm believer  in colorblind nontraditional casting  for instance i hope to play porgy one day  and we should definitely see who else comes in  but yeah im a little worried that  kurt may be a little delicate for tony  school bell ringing    school bell ringing  this is not the poster we agreed on  the poster that you wanted gave me crippling depression  i wanted something toned down  this is toned down  in the original  the unicorn was riding you  i dont know why youre so upset  youre special you need to embrace it  this is who you are im not gonna win  rachel rachel i need you  i need you to come with me to the auditorium right now  and help me audition for tony again  lastminute emergency audition say no more  and stop putting up those posters  i failed my precious unicorn  no  look this campaign is brilliant  really  completely and if he doesnt get it  then he doesnt deserve to have you as his campaign manager  theres no one like you  youre a genius brittany  you are the unicorn  are we seeing more ethnic marias today  thats rude  beiste is there any more  oh  im sorry  i thought you two auditioned already  you heard me sing but i wanted to show you  the pure masculine power and intensity i would bring to tony  if and when you graced me with the part  snickers  sorry sorry  ive asked your obvious mariaelect  to do a cold reading with me  not from west side story  but from the play its originally based on  william shakespeares romeo and juliet  and might i just add that i only read through the scene once  ten minutes ago and im already off book  so youre playing romeo kurt  picture if you will  juliets boudoir  post coitus  wilt thou be gone  it is not yet near day  it was the nightingale and not the lark  that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear  nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree  believe me love it was the nightingale  tis the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale  look love what envious streaks do lace  the severing clouds in yonder east  night candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe  on the misty mountain tops  i must be gone and live or stay and die  rachel thou light is not daylight i know it i  it is some meteor  that the sun exhald to be to thee a torch bearer  to light thee on thy way to mantua  therefore stay yet thou needst not be gone  let me be taen let me be put to death  for i am content thou wilt have it so  ill say  that yon grey is not the morning eye  tis but the pale reflex of cynthias brow  laughs  nornor that is not the lark  whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads  i have more care to stay than will to go  home death welcome  for juliet wills it so  snickers  laughter  no its kiss me its fine you can kiss me  i dont we can keep going  kurt  kurt im so sorry kurt  clears throat  school bell ringing  sugar offkey  i am a shining star    i am a shining star i am a shining   okay stop stop stop  in tune  i am a shining star i am a shining star    do you hear the difference  yeah

aspergers  squeals  shes hopeless you know  nobodys hopeless  what happened to you quinn  sorry  i know what happened to you  same thing happened to me  when i gave up rachel  i went with a regis philbin tattoo  and the sinead oconnor haircut  must have looked like crap  it was a disaster  laughs  but eventually i realized  that no matter how much it hurt me  sighs softly  i did right by my daughter  thats the real measure of motherhood  how much of yourself will you give up for them  king solomon and all that  yeah well im not going back to being that girl  little miss blonde perfect  quinn chuckles  were you ever really that girl  i mean would that kind of girl  even get pregnant in the first place  do you seriously expect me to think that this is the real you  yeah  yeah sure  something like this  youre 18 youre graduating high school  this is the time  this is the time when you should find yourself  first step to becoming an adult  stop punishing yourself  for things you did when you were a child  can i see her  i know puck got to  not yet  how about a photo  please  you want to know who you really are  look at that sweet special little face  she looks just like you

helping me out yeah well  i need the distraction im gonna be in emotional defcon 1  until they post the audition results for the musical  which means im gonna be even more selfcentered than usual  just so you know why you know youre gonna get the lead  i know i am but i mean  you dont really know until you know  you can still try out  i mean the field for tony is wide open  well i mean between football and school  i dont really have time  and i got to go to this booty camp thing  my dancing has got to get better or its gonna cost us nationals  plus burt pays me good here  im saving up for

actor does  but to not get a shot at it i mean it kills me  i dont know if youve noticed but no ones  really looking for a kurt hummel type  to play opposite kate hudson in a rom com  kurt i say if
