should have known by the looks on my students faces  that id really stepped in it  my yearly rendition of la cucarachaon taco tuesday  used to be such a hit  the truth is im ashamed  to be a teacher is to offer students  a gateway to the future and i blew it  how could i have become so out of touch  school bell ringing  william  what do you mean you received complaints   who complained  i cant tell you that  but i can tell you that your teaching skills  have been seriously brought into question  look ii know im not a native spanish speaker   sometimes i get a little tripped up  william  will you please remove that enormous sombrero  so i can break it down for you  as you may have heard our history teacher mrs hagberg  has been forced into retirement  due to some memory problems  and thats how germany won the second world war  hagberg was a tenured teacher at this school  for over 40 years  her departure means theres an open tenured position  here at mckinley  oh principal figgins  emma and i just got engaged  well be starting a family soon i need that tenure  and i would love to give it to you william  but youre only one of several teachers  im considering for this position  and to be frank you have a public relations problem  if you want the tenure  youve got to turn it around in the class  ookay how do i do that  youre a spanish teacher  maybe you should try learning spanish   school bell ringing  seor martinez  you can call me david  david i am thrilled  that spanish has so many different ways to say  to be but right now what i need to do  is to learn how to say  stop using my toilet to my maid  i was hoping you could tell me what the word gordita means  i know were all here for different reasons  most of you need your geds  some of you want to go to cabo san lucas  and order like a local  but did you know that the us census believe that by 2030  the majority of americans will use spanish  as their first language  youre not here learning a language  youre here cause youre smart and youre forward thinkers  im sorry im trying to listen but you got some beautiful teeth  chuckles  asi que repiten conmigo come on repeat with me  school bell rings  david

 theres a hiring freeze  you know could you maybe say that a little slower  i think your accents throwing me off   where you from  ohio  but my parents are from chile  and we only spoke spanish in the house growing up  oh  howhow long have you been uh working here  just a few months this is  actually the beginning of my career change  for the last six years i was a tooth model  its like a hand model but with your teeth  man your teeth are really white  yeah no coffee no cigarettes no beets  i was the top tooth model in the country  colgate crest whitestrips sensodyne  whenever they needed a smile for their advertisement  they would call on dave martinez  wow that sounds like a great gig  what whyd you stop  well one day i  i realized i was spending so much time flossing i  i was missing my life i want to make a difference  that lasts longer than a grin you know  ii want to teach kids  i want to give them something useful  something they can they can take with them  their whole lives  i want to help them find their duende   you know duende right  of course  duende yeah  now you also teach glee club right   i do  you see thats thats inspiring  i actually wanted to try forming the night school glee club  but meeting after school means 200 in the morning   ah right  laughs i love to sing  i actually learned english watching reruns of solid gold  wait youre serious  yeah theytheyve done studies on it  the brain takes in information like a new language  or a math equation much more quickly  and retains it better when that information  is delivered through music  well theres a lot of duende involved too  you know what i would do if i was teaching glee club  latin music think about it  you get those kids singing in spanish  and theyll be learning the language  without even realizing it  will if i could have some of my glee kids speaking spanish  by the end of the week itd be a hell of an accomplishment  thats teacher of the year stuff  twice a day you boys stain  your mothers drapes or befoul a gym sock  that has to jump from the hamper straight into therapy  sue why not head on down to the clinic  and put your virile teen years to good use  youll have

in a different direction  while theres still time  are you sure thats even possible  yes william i am sure  you see i had my eggs frozen in the late 70s  they didnt even have that technology in the late 70s  i know i did it myself  the good people at kroger have been keeping a box  of my championship ova  cooling in their meat locker  and what with the financial security  that will be afforded

depressed vampire  shes into both of them  oh come on mercedes she just knows  but what if they both make her feel amazing in different ways  well you dont get to choose when it comes to true love  true love chooses you  and you better be certain when it comes to marriage  because marriage is promise and it lasts for forever  ladies i appreciate you spending time  with me while blaine recovers

top ramen weeks  but in every single one of my dreams  okay struggling or not there he is  finn  look i know that i am going to be with finn  for the rest of my life just as much as i know  that i am

proposed to you today  so will you please keep my secret  arent you scared youre making the wrong choice  look i know that i have the right person  scary part was just choosing to know it  gloria estefans dont wanna lose you begins  sometimes its hard  to make things clear  or know when to face the truth  and i know  that the moment is here  so open your eyes  and see who i am  and not who you

okay look i know how it feels to want  to start a family  i want to have a baby too  i wouldnt get your hopes up  i doubt your avian frame could withstand  the rigors of childbirth  okay just tell me why will  you hate him youve made that very clear  well in case you havent noticed deena  i have a little bit of a mean streak  im cunning im vindictive i spend a large portion  of every day vibrating with a palpable sense  of wild irrational rage  and i dont ever want my kid to feel that  and every time ive insulted will  or tried to stop him in his crusade  to ruin pop culture by wiping his woolly behind  with the american songbook  hes always risen up and met me with kindness  if goodness and optimism are somehow genetic  thats what i want for my child  he isnt gonna do it is he  i prefer to let him tell you that  im really sorry sue  you know for what its worth  i i think you should have a child  i think itd be really good for you  bell ringing  hey dude you want to lift some

 who your dad really is andand losing the scholarship  but youre a star finn just as bright as rachel  you just dont believe in yourself  yeah well the proofs in the pudding okay  and my pudding pretty much sucks  look im not telling you that you shouldnt marry rachel  i love her despite all of her crazy  and i think that youd be lucky to marry her one day  but i dont want you just to turn yourself into nothing  but the guy who holds her purse on the red carpet  look im getting to the point in my life where  i kind of need to be honest with myself about who i am  and who is that  not you  not rachel  thats the point finn  there are plenty of us trust me  the one thing that glee clubs and theater programs dont have  is the hot straight football player who can sing and sort of dance  youre unique finn  and i cant see this proposal thing as anything else  but you giving up on yourself  no no its not  at least i dont i dont think it is  your time isnt up finn  its just beginning  hey kurt  thanks  bell ringing  hold it right there sandbacks  you and i need to have a serious chat  now i realize when i chose becky  as cocaptain for the cheerios  it might have rubbed you the wrong way  wanky  and ive often admired the craven heartlessness  of your pointless vindictive backstabbing  kind of takes me back to the old salad days  but you crossed the maginot line  when you started messing with sue sylvesters family  what are you talking about what family  you lodged a complaint about my teaching tactics  with principal figgins possibly derailing my bid  for tenure just when im trying to have a baby  a baby with whose vagina  hey what is going on here  coach sylvester is accusing me of something i didnt do  oh stop with the lies sweater meat or you will be hawking
