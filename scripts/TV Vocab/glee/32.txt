wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful  wonderful day of the year  hey guys whats this  oh were trying to get into the christmas spirit mr shue  christmas is totally my favorite holiday and check out  this awesome tree i found it on the side of the road  it must have fell off some guys car  and the ornaments the guy who lives next door finally killed off  his elderly mother and when they carted him off  they left the house like wide open so  i think she was a holiday hoarder  uh aand the presents  i lifted them from a display at the mall but dont worry  theyre empty  guys look i appreciate the effort  but this isnt what christmas is supposed to be like  for us it is  this tree is like a mascot for glee club  we won sectionals  two years in a row  and according to everyone at this school we still suck  this reindeer sweater last year    ooh hohoho losers  haha  im pretty sure they just added food coloring  to real slush from the parking lot  you can eat that you know  no no i am not  gonna let you guys throw yourselves a pity party  look im the first one to say that things havent turned out  exactly how i would have liked them to this year but christmas  is all about being grateful for the things that did  i thought that was thanksgiving  and this year glee club is going to lend a hand  to the mckinneyvento homeless children and youth program  right here in lima how are we going to do that  the only way we know how by singing about it  were going to go classroom to classroom  caroling to raise money for mckinneyvento  wait classrooms in this school with like students in them  well if there are no students in them there will be no one  to put money in the collection box while we sing  were gonna be killed  no guys its christmas  a time for miracles  we got to try this  finns right  so lets start rehearsing  this year glee clubs going full santa    haul out the holly  put up the tree before my spirit falls again  fill up the stocking  i may be rushing things but deck the halls again now  you suck  who goes caroling with a band  id seriously rather be learning  for we need a little christmas  youre making me hate christmas right this very minute  candles

shoe at us  i guess were done caroling  no were not guys  we cant let what just happened ruin our christmas spirit  mr shue got us this beautiful tree to inspire us  were gonna practice now and gear up for round two tomorrow  pretty soon no one will bully us  santa claus can do anything and this year  i asked for the glee club to stop getting picked on  shes kidding right  guys this is serious listen up  brittany still believes in santa claus  stifled laughter  you cannot be serious last week brittany believed a comb had magic powers  this is kind of a pattern quinn shes gonna find out sooner or later  would you mind um  meeting me at the auditorium tomorrow at 400 sure  okay somebody needs to break the news to her uhuh dont look at me  i mean im cruel and all but thats just hardcore  rightthats my point hear me out  remember when you were a kid how excited you would get  when you would think about santa claus  how awesome it was  christmas was the highlight of the year  why wouldnt you want to keep someones world  magical for a little while longer  how  ive got it all figured out  can i be honest  i dont understand the difference between an elf and a slave  shouting  im not sitting on that guys lap  santas laps are always really warm and its creepy  we all have to sit on santas lap if brittany sees that we  all still believe it will make her strong enough to withstand  all the santa naysayers in the world  which is everyone over the age of six  im pretty sure this isnt going to work  that guy doesnt even look like santa  trust me all brittanys gonna see is the suit  she wants to believe in him  mercedes get up there  go mercedes go mercedes go  mercedes ive been a very good girl santa  i want a pony and a doll that laughs and cries and  sniffs one of

him for a full set of free weights  kept asking my dad how did santy get  those 75pound dumbbells down the chimney  should have suspected something  when dad was in traction until the end of january  youve got the perfect santa body type  watch it puckerman  look we rented the suit  all you need to do is put it on  just tell her that you cant give her  the gift of me walking this year  that seems so harsh and not at all like santa  she asked santa for the impossible  me walking again  if christmas morning comes around and im not  dancing in glee club rehearsal with no personal explanation  from her idol shes going to lose faith in old saint nick  and we cant have that  tell her the elves are working on it  elves have awesome cord blood for stem cell research  but these advances are a few years away  okay  great and then we need you to break into her house  whatno no way the back door will be open  ii talked to her parents they really want her to believe too  school bell ringing  becky look coach  the janitor staff got you hideous gloves  sue give me those  theyll come in handy  no fingerprints  suit up becky  i dont understand why we have to dress up coach  well this way if

watches  and the girls are gonna sell off their hair  you cant do that oh no its cool  most of this isnt mine anyways  no i mean thats not the answer  there are other ways to raise money at christmastime  no but we tried caroling and it didnt work  wait i thought you and finn were getting us a new tree  we went  but finn bailed  before we could get one  nice christmas spirit finn  will wait  guys no more fighting  sighs  have any of you ever actually read gift of the magi  none of you  you dont have to read gift of the magi  everybody knows what its about  well if you actually read it  youd know what its about  yeah i know what its about life freakin sucks  actually youre right  the first christmas you remember having  is the greatest day of your life  your familys all together  there are loads of presents cookies  the magic is alive and well  but before you know it you grow up  work and school and girlfriends take over  and christmas becomes more of an obligation  a reminder of whats lost instead of whats possible  and all of the trees and the presents  and even the mistletoe cant change that  and then when you get to my age  youre so desperate to get that magic back  youd do anything  to be able to feel  how you did that first christmas  so what should we do  put your scissors down put your watches back on  were gonna go out and find some people  who really need some christmas spirit  and we are gonna sing for them  get a good nights rest ken youre gonna need it  barbie took the early flight from tampa  clattering  santa  but its too early  well you know what they say  earlys late if you make tomorrow yesterday  awesome  you know brittany  i was in the neighborhood  doing a dry run  i have so many houses to visit on christmas eve  i got to make sure it goes off without a hitch  how about you come sit with ol santy  chuckles okay  how about you sit next to santy instead  santys just a little stinky  laughs he needs a good ol  sponge bath from mrs claus  chuckles  brittany do you remember what you asked me for for christmas  yeah i asked for artie to be able to walk  is there anything else that you want  i mean like anything  no  well see santas trying his best  but that ones a little hard  but youre magic  sometimes what santa wants to give  a good girl like you is patience  because believe it or not  there are even some things that he cant manage  you know  there was a girl a little younger than you  and she was a little husky  she was always asking santy for the same thing  to make her look more like the other girls  she wasnt asking to be pretty or nothing  but she just didnt want to stick out so much  santa just couldnt do it  so instead santa gave her patience  and later on that girl was  was glad tt santy didnt give her what she had asked him for  she she put being husky to good use  was her name ricki lake  sighs the point is  i dont think im going to be able to give you  what youre asking for even though id like to  but santa im sorry pumpkin  itsits just not going to happen  arent you going to go up the chimney  on dry runs santy uses the isuzu  school bell ringing  whats going on  i think ive lost the christmas spirit  its santa  i dont know if i can tell you  i used to believe that santa could do anything  if santa isnt magical i dont even know if i want to believe anymore  it isnt fair that you cant walk artie  i feel so terrible  hey look at me  im fine  hey guys we need you in the teachers lounge  mr shue brittanys not feeling so good  santa thing  if you dont mind i think im going  to take her home make sure shes okay  good idea well make do without you  school bell ringing  hey uh so were your students  all year long you suffer through dealing with us  i imagine having some of us in your classes  would slowly chip away at your hopes and dreams  until the whole world just felt like a neverending  nightmare of pain just get to the point finn  right uh anyway were here today  to help raise money  for children that have a lot less than we do  and i know some of us have had a hard christmas  but what weve come to learn is that no matter  how tough things get  there isnt anything that more santa  or a couple more jingle bells cant cure  sue well becky we did it  we got all my presents back  and as satisfying as it is to have been  gifted enough rotisserie ovens to roast an entire hobo  for me the real joy of christmas  was breaking the collective heart of the glee club  gentle melodic music playing  whats that coach  welcome christmas playing  fahoo fores dahoo
