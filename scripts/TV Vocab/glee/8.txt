good choices  as in for instance choosing to join homo explosion  do i need to remind you that glee club  helped us win our first game of the season  what have you done for me lately  yeah were taking a bunch of heat  because you like kissing dudes all of a sudden  youre not being a team player man  couldnt believe you was man enough to knock up quinn fabray  you sure a real man  didnt sneak in there and do it for you  thats it  team fight fight fight  fight fight fight  blowing whistle  fight fight fight fight  fight fight fight okay break it up get up break it up  get back get off hey calm down everybody  on the sidelines take a knee  now  what if you had broken finns arm huh  wed be worse off and more pathetic than we already are  wheres puckerman  uh he said he had to miss practice today  hes working on something for glee club  what is he working on his  coming out of the closet speech or something  hey man dont push me man ken hey enough  football  is war  and no one single man can win that war  not even if they strap nukes on him  i want you to start acting like a team again  when we won that one game it wasnt because we were dancing  it was because we were of singular purpose  i want you to start hanging more  spend more time together which is why  starting next week i am adding extra practice  on thursdays at 330  but coach thats when glee rehearses  you know what i have had it up to here  with schuester and glee  heres the story quarterback  and you tell puckerman this  when you see him  that practice is mandatory no exceptions  so youre gonna have to choose whats more important to you  football or glee club   what a girl wants what a girl needs    whatever makes me happy sets you free    and im thanking you for knowing exactly    what a girl wants what a girl needs    whatever keeps me in your arms   puck i know this looks weird  but wait until you see what happens next  my ears are starting to hurt  could we take a break  okay  you want to make out  sure  i know its whack  but i also remember  what my history teacher told us last semester  only nixon can go to china  i have no idea what she meant but it reminded me of when  my family ordered chinese food and sat down together  for our traditional simchas torah screening  of schindlers list  thats really when all of this started  it wasnt the most normal tradition  but we did it for my mom  she said it made her feel connected  gunshot to her jewish roots  screaming  as she was giving me my sweetandsour pork  she said something that really hit home  youre no better than them noah  sniffles  why cant you date a jewish girl  that night i had the strangest dream  i knew it was a dream  because theres no way rachel could have  climbed up the wall outside my window with no shoes on     when i woke up i knew  it was more than a dream it was a message from god  rachel was a hot jew  and the good lord wanted me to get into her pants  school bell rings     gasps  i picked it up for you when i was buying dip  its grape i know thats your favorite  because the last time i tossed a grape one in your face  you licked your lips before you cleaned yourself off  hey i was wondering if you wanted to work together on some mashup ideas  things happened pretty fast from that point  getting her to make out with me was easier than i thought  guess shes kinda desperate  you okay baby  i cant do this  why  were a couple of goodlooking jews  its natural  ii cant give myself to someone who isnt  brave enough to sing a solo  if you dont have the guts to do that  thenthen how are you gonna be bold enough to deal with  the ups and downs of loving an admittedly highmaintenance  girl like me  are you questioning my badassness  have you seen my guns  no i im sorry but  your arms are lovely but  i just dont see us working out  will so  any ideas for the mashup  will anybody  oh come on guys  its like youre daring me to start dancing  i will no no  ive been working on something

inclined    ba ba ba    to believe they never would    oh no no   song ends  shouting whooping puckerman  yeah  you know i really think this is working  i think we look super cool  im proud of you finn  im proud of us  yeah nothing wrong with wanting to be popular  it just means you want people to like you  i think thats healthy i totally agree  being popular just means you can have it all  oh hey guys  you thirsty  sure thanks  you cant do this  oh you think thats bad just imagine whats gonna happen  if you dont show up to practice on thursday  and quit that little glee club for good  bros before hihos dude  dont forget that  i hear people say thats not how i define marriage  well to them i say love knows no bounds  why cant people marry dogs  im certainly not advocating intimacy with

well erma just raved about you  so im actually touched  you seem so happy and nice  and youve been so cool with quinn fabray  and her you know situation  yeah well shes just a confused kid  and the least i can offer her is my compassion  but you mister aw  the sue sylvester who has been obsessed  with sabotaging your every move is now just a distant memory  thats great sue  now all i feel for you is sympathy  whether it be for your sham of a marriage  or the fact that coach tanakas finally laying down the law  with regard to glee club  wait what  yeah tanakasans making the kids choose  i mean come on lets be honest  what kids gonna choose glee club over football  itd be ridiculous  hey ken you want  to tell me what the hells going on  you knew i had a standing glee rehearsal on thursday  we sat down and worked out a schedule  when some of your guys joined the club  circumstances have changed  i have a serious morale issue with my team  its my responsibility to fix it  sorry if me doing my job interferes with your club  ken weve known each other for years  your commitment to football is about as long as your pants  you know lets get into what this is really about  youre upset that i dont like your song  for your wedding mashup  and youre right its not my place to have an opinion  why dont you just cut the crap will  youre not that naive  this is not about a song  its about my fiance  you and i the whole world knows  that im just a consolation prize to you  how do you think that makes me feel  emmas totally into you  emma is settling for me  and i love her so much i dont care  but it doesnt mean i appreciate you  coming in with your gene kelly charm  and getting high off of her fawning over you  ii have never intentionally encouraged emma  but i havent discouraged her either  you dont have to worry about it anymore though  so are we cool  can i have my guys on thursday again   you keep your rehearsal  ill keep my practice  well let the kids decide whos first choice  and whos the consolation prize  making tommy tune the first to win  tony gold in four categories  totally interesting  you know you never told me what you thought of my mashup solo  youre still missing the elusive high b  thats a brass ring for a baritenor  i had to work on it for weeks with finn before he got it  youre a great performer noah  i just want to say how proud i am  to have you on my arm in front of the whole high school  chuckling  youre pretty good at this  ive had a lot of practice  youre actually a lot luckier than me and quinn  your head is shaved  im really sorry i ever did this to you  its okay  no it isnt  no one deserves this feeling  you know what the worst part is  its not the burning in your eyes or the way  the slushie drips all the way into your underpants  its the humiliation  i feel like i could burst into tears at any moment  rachel  im sorry but  today when the clock chimes 330  youre choosing football over glee  which means we probably cant be together anymore  yes  damn i feel like such a bad jew  are you ready yet  weve only got an hour for lunch emma  emma its not like trying on a pair of jeans will  well it doesnt have to be perfect  we just have to see if you can dance in it  it fits okay  yeah fits great  terrific  yeah terrific  uh so should we see if you can dance in it  okay this is  the instrumental version of your wedding song  i could have danced all night plays   i could have danced all night    i could have danced all night    and still have begged    for more    i could have spread my wings    and done a thousand things    ive never done    before    ill never know what made it so    exciting    why all at once my heart    took flight    i only know    when he began to dance with me    i could have

happens  clears throat  wait what showdown  i thought i thought you and sue had that last week  between me and your fianc  kens told all the football players in glee  that they have to choose between the club and the team  and unless all the guys choose glee  it looks like we wont have enough members for sectionals  then glee is over  i know  well wish me luck  hey guys  ticks  i guess theyre not coming  im really sorry guys  i cant believe this  i thought they were our friends  how can they just abandon us  soft laughter  hi squeals  indistinct chatter  you scared me we made it  will good

hey man  you made the right decision  whats up dude  whistle blows  okay lets huddle up  do it  i really dont want to  honestly i know how picky you are  about what products you use on your face  but youve been getting so much pressure  from the gorillas on the football team  i guess they didnt  appreciate me resigning from the team and choosing glee  probably wouldve went over better  if you didnt announce it in the showers  you are not going to slushie on my man kurt  why wouldnt he hes made his choice  he doesnt care about us losers anymore  no thats not true its just if i dont do it  the guys on the team are going to kick the crap out of me  well we cant have that can we  what are you doing  its called taking one for the team  gasps  now get out of here  and take some time to think whether or not any of your  friends on the football team wouldve done that for you  someone get me to a day spa stat  ooh hey hey hey  oh sue  rod  andrea  uh you arent scheduled to tape another

wife understood that  are we still on for saturday night  no  cheering  do you miss it  hell no  i hope you didnt choose glee over football because of me  why  because i dont think this relationship

baby in her belly  you like her dont you  i can see you staring at her when im staring at finn  is that why you joined glee  to be closer to her  like i said theyre never breaking up  god whats the matter with me  im a stud and i cant even hold onto a chick like you  no offense  why dont girls like me  cause youre kind of a jerk no offense  i just think you want it too much  which is something i can relate to  i want everything too much  our relationship was built on a fantasy  like every other one in my life  i think i just agreed to us being together  because i thought it would make finn jealous  i just hope we can still be friends  we werent friends before  hey finn  want to have a catch  sure  go long  im not coming back  these are the moments finn theyre the crossroads  the ones you look back on when you get old  and think what if  i dont buy that  i dont think any one decision makes your life  unless you accidentally invent  some kind of zombie virus or something  no youre right  lifes a series of choices a big combination of moments  little ones that add up to big ones that create who you are  youre letting other people make those choices for you finn  youre letting them decide who youre going to be  people youre not even going to know in three years  people whose names youre going to forget  when you run into them in the hardware store  you dont understand the kind of pressure im under  yes i do because of all the students ive ever had  you remind me the most of me  come back to glee finn  its where you belong  hey coach can i talk to you about something  you got an itch down there or something  what no  uh  im the quarterback right the leader  sure  well all this stuff about having to choose  between glee and football is making it hard for me to lead  leaders are supposed to see things that other guys dont  right like they can imagine a future where things are better  like thomas jefferson or that kid from the terminator movies  i see a future where its cool to be in glee club  where you can play football and sing and dance  and no one gets down on you for it  where the more different you are the better  i guess what im trying to say is  i dont want to have to choose between them anymore  its not cool  sighs  you know about that thursday practice its uh  canceled indefinitely ive got some stuff  i got to do that time laundry things like that  oh sweet  finn  tell puckerman and the other guys too will you  sure  thanks coach  school bell ringing  schuester  yeah  ill need to see that set list for sectionals after all  and i want it on
