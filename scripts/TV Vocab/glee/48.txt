beth for a couple of hours  any night your choosing for some me time  have you ever babysat before  mmm ask mr shue  we took care of  his sisterinlaws three demon spawn  and they were practically purring  by the end of the night  please  you said you wanted us to get to know beth  sighs  i got a bee in my bonnet  and that bees name is government waste  earlier today i saw a state employee  in the person of one verna the lunch lady  throw away 300 pounds of precious expired turkey gravy  simply because uncle sam said  there were too many weevils in it  well you know what has no expiration date voters  my rage  i have in my hand the budget  for the mckinley high production of west side story  a musical about a race war that glorifies gang violence  yet still seems extraordinarily gay  this is a top secret document ohio  and were opening it up tonight  2004 ohio  thats a years salary for a public school math teacher  wasted on fake switchblades  and the soft packing of teen dance belts  if this nation wants to impress its future chinese overlords  we need to get our priorities straight  and thats why i encourage every ohioan  to call mckinley high school and sing them this song  im fed up and angry too  and i agree with candidate sue  and thats how sue sees it  phone ringing mckinley high please hold  mckinley high please hold mckinley high please hold  you cant just cut the musal  sues pompom budget is 4000 a month  cant put a price on cheer william  i really expected more from you ggins  i thought you were a friend of the arts  william im caught between a rock and a different  yet equally hard rock  just this morning  i was assaulted in the parking lot  you my son cant read  and you want him to sing and dance  screams  the clinton years are over  were in a recession william  thats about to doubledip into a piping hot  crockpot of voter fury  and if this school doesnt learn some priorities  well come november  the voters will gladly teach you some  what if i can get the money myself  ha good luck with that william  the arts are going down  today the musical  tomorrow the glee club  next week npr and opera and brunch and tom bergeron  school bell ringing  hi santana  how many solos did you get in glee club last year  a few  one valerie  and i loved it  i was also the lips in rocky horror  listen if you and i were in shelbys group  wed get all the solos and the duets  our voices sound amazing together  plus its an allgirl group  why would i care about allgirl  its all lady power all the time  i mean shelbys a great teacher  im im hitting notes i didnt even know existed  she gets me what i have to give  it feels good  santana you know honestly i wish i could but  somebodys got to look out for brittany  i mean that special place where she lives  yeah its beautiful but  someones got to help her cross the street  i could never just leave her  get her to come with you  santana you know what girl chang  if you cry every time someone gets a hangnail  it kind of starts toose its effect  its not a hangnail  mercedes was one of glees original members  i feel naked in here without her yeah well get used to it  cause without her singing for us  were going to have to perform naked  for the judges to vote for us at sectionals  no i will not let this setback crush our spirits  i mean we have handled worse  than losing one of our best singers  kind of hard not to blame you mr shue  think you were too hard on her at booty camp  tina i blame artie  why couldnt you have just given maria to mercedes  artie because that would have damaged  my integrity as an artist  sorry i am late  i was putting up posters for my  for my campaign  did you airbrush out your jowls  no look let stop it everybody  so we lost a singer  so they canceled the musical  wait what no no no no  you cant cancel my musical  sue cut the funding  the point is right now we shouldnt  be turning on each other i agree  i can only speak from my experience with the warblers  but no show choir is just one person its a team  when we lost a warbler we just replaced him with another one  which is easy when your waiting list has a waiting list  dude i know youre a big deal at dalton  or whatever but we dont wear blazers her  so have a seat im trying to give a pep talk  didnt you just say something about us  not turning on each other  no you cant cancel my musical  okay i was considering changing my name to maria  the musical is not canceled  as for mercedes yes that is a huge loss for us  but we will deal with replacing her later  right now we need to focus on putting on this musical  how  we sell ads in the program  i figure we can get ten  maybe 20 bucks apiece for them  so well only have to sell about 200  well i think its a brilliant idea  and i volunteer myself to spearhead the charge  itll give me a great opportunity to uh bust out  my banana republic mad men collection  okay all right lets break off  into smaller groups figure out whos going to canvass  which parts of the city and guys i dont care  what sue does or who leaves us  everyone in this groups dreams  are going to come true this year  lets do it hey santana  ready to

cost of the show  theyre only ten dollars each  and ive already talked to the lima mortuary society  about buying a couple and we we need about 200  you fund sues cheerleading squad  but you cant find a couple grand for the musical  figgins allow me to introduce you  to some friends of mine down at the rotary club  these are the owners of limas three funeral parlors  well strictly speaking mine is a pet funeral parlor  and mine is a crematorium  so we also bake and delir delicious brick oven pizza  these three businessmen wrote a check today  to fund west side story in completion  and are now assured fullpage ads  in the program for the musical  shor im a big fan of the show  just because there are so many deaths in it  burt so will unless im mistaken  i think this means the show is back on  burt i think youre right  gentlemen thank you so much  appreciate it really appreciate your generosity  all right thank you thank you  burt i cant thank you enough  hey sue  school bell ringing  just thought id let you know we got the money  so the musicals back on  why if it isnt porcelains dad  who may or may not have a baboon heart  i thought i smelled blue collar  just so you know after

tubbington nougat and sprinkles  and then i rub his belly seven times with glitter sticks  but so far nothing works  you do that because  i want lord tubbington to poop candy bars  what does everybody wish for that or something  brittany i was wondering  if maybe youd like to do dinner tonight  oh i cant  i have plans with a friend  and youre not supposed to eat anything  but fourleaf clovers anyways so  thanks  bein green playing   its not that easy being green    having to spend each day the color of the leaves    when i think it could be nicer    being red or yellow or gold   or something much more colorful like that    its not that easy being green    it seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things    and people tend to pass you over    cause youre not standing out like flashy sparkles    in the water or stars in the sky    but greens the color of spring    and green can be cool and friendlylike    and green can be big like an ocean    or important like a mountain or tall like a tree    when green is all there is to be    it could make you wonder   but why wonder why wonder   im green and itll do fine   and its beautiful   and i think its what i want to be   brit  i want to talk about um  you know that thing that we never talk about  what that sour patch kids are just  gummi bears that turned to drugs  are we dating or what  wait isnt this a date  arent you paying cause i ordered shrimp  wasnt last week when we were taking a bath together  wasnt that a date  are you crying  its just that im really happy  well i told you last year  that if im single and youre single  that wed mingle  and if theres any controversy that interferes  with my presidential campaign then ill use  one of my leprechaun wishes to win the election  youyou think that

want to be known as a quitter  doesnt my presidential campaign need continuity  can i think about it for like a day  yeah  no totally i understand  yeah just think about it  but in the meantime  i do have one more wish  mmhmm  i wish youd hold my hand  but like under the napkin  puck global warming is awesome  all those melting ice caps keep my pool cleaning business open  from march through

quarter and a dead raccoon  nice work pony  you can keep the raccoon  thanks  and then theres the ladies  i like them in all shapes and sizes  and yeah that sometimes includes extra large  but what

lot of mileage  coming on this show and scaring you into thinking  that a high school putting on a musical  is the reason why your neighbors house got  foreclosed on now what she doesnt tell you is how  she spends twice the entire mckinley high school arts budget  on things like legwarmers for her cheerios  she wants you to think that the arts are a luxury  we just cant afford but shes got it backwards  you know in this economy art music theatre dance  these are things we cant afford to lose  now sue sylvester thinks that fostering a students creativity  is a waste of money  i think its the way you invest in this countrys future  we all need to get creative  you got an idea how we can boo jobs in this district  i want to hear it  you send it to hummel tires and lube lima ohio  and if

know what public school program is the first to go in a recession  special education  there are special needs kids at mckinley  yet theres no special ed classes no special ed teacher  i think that

if i just dig in  say u2s overrated say it never  hey leave him alone  or what pigskin youre gonna run crying to mr shue  oh im shakin  no not mr shue  coach beiste  thanks finn hudson ive got no
