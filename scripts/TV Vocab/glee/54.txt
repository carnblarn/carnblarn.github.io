to to help people like he did  i knew it was about him  you dont have to prove to anyone that your dad is in you  you know everybody already knows what kind of man you are  yeah but how can you really know until you get tested  and what better way than  than to walk in his footsteps  your dad was a good man  he was brave and true and  he had the same goofy sense of humor you do  but he didnt die in iraq  he served over there but something happened to him  i never found out what  uh i he  i dont know if hehe did something or saw something  or just lost his way but  but he broke  he died a heros death right  he died in cincinnati  after being dishonorably discharged  honey he had a drug problem  that he tried to get over when he came home  for for you mostly  but but then he he would just  disappear for a day or a week sometimes  one day he just didnt come back  it was an overdose  oh i feel sick  its a lot to hear  just uh you know take it slow  oh my god  i see everything that was
