                1 school bell ringing  sue madonna  simply saying the word aloud makes me feel powerful  even in voiceover how i have worshipped her  ever since i was a little girl  sorry angie jolie catherine the great  madonna is the most powerful woman  to ever walk the face of the earth  im instating a new policy whereby  we play madonnas greatest hits over the pa system  quite loudly throughout the entire school day  but blasting her delicious hooks would make it impossible  for the students to concentrate  ah who cares madonna never finished college  she hopped a cab for the bright lights  of new york city with  and i think we should encourage our pupils to do the same  you say the word and i willhprovide you  a list of the students i believe should be  rounded up and shipped off immediately  i am sorry sue this is insanity  what you call insanity i call inspiration  let me break it down for you  its been the biggest dream of my career  to pay homage to madonna  the woman most responsible for my takenoprisoners  demeanor and my subconscious tendency to always be  desperately looking for someone named susan  and now my cheerio squad this year  finally has the talent to make that dream come true  you will not take that dream from me  do you not understand  the blackmail process and how it works  smile  i have your wifes phone number on speed dial  to recap you will be playing those madonna hits  throughout the day at an earsplitting volume  understood  santana  what does your bracelet say  wwmd  what would madonna do  well the answer to that question is usually  date a younger man  so lets see some arm candy girls  sorry freshmen  youre going to have to start trolling the middle schools  and you know why  cause if you want to be  as riveting a performer as madonna  a skill that will nab us nationals  this year youre going to have to start  thinking like her acting like her  also   la madonna i will no longer acknowledge  that any of you have last names  becky jackson  from now on  youre just becky  you know its like madonna once said  im tough im ambitious and i know what i want  if that makes me a bitch okay  im pretty sure she stole that line  from one sue sylvester  no really she stole it from me  i said it first  palladium  87   can i ask you guys something private  yes you should move to israel  its about dating  not that im dating anyone  we all know that finn and i are no longer an item  and for the sake of the team i broke up with jessie  but lets just say i was dating someone  lets just say hypothetically we went to a wiggles concert  last friday night and then because my dads  werent home we went up to my room  and started making out  it was erotic and romantic  and then he said  we should do it  it totally  havent you done it before  no  have you  what do you think  its no big deal  for a girl it is  what if then he got really crabby and left and didnt even  take home the care bear i won him playing skee ball  quinn would you please stop talking  youre grossing out my baby  i just want to be ready i know im getting older  and these things are going to happen someday but  how do i stop a guy from getting mad at me for saying no  just do what i do never say no  oh totally i mean whats the worst that can happen  sorry quinn mercedes look girl dont ask me  the last guy i liked was the mayor of gaytown  and i cant wait to get a guy  mad at me for saying no we just have to accept  that guys dont care about our feelings  like the other day i was walking with artie  ive thought a lot about it and i forgive you  for lying about your stutter  however if youre planning on getting all up on this  im going to need you to make some changes  the goth thing was two years ago so maybe lose  the vampire makeup and consider some tighterfitting clothing  youve got the pow and i believe you should work it more  if were going to be an item  thats got to sting  hey guys im sorry  to interrupt your little sorority  but i couldnt help but overhearing  are you really having that much boy trouble  you wouldnt understand  mr shue youre a guy  well then maybe you should talk to someone else about it  like ms pillsbury i tried that  oh um thats a hotbutton topic isnt it  i mean when to do that  this is the perfect chat to have with your mom  i have two gay dads  right right you um  how about your rabbi  i really dont feel comfortable talking about this  with rabbi greenberg  arent you a guidance counselor  uh  school bell rings  the fact is  is that women still earn 70 cents  to every dollar that a man does for doing the same job  that attitude starts in high school  emma i dont know what to say i mean  i cant do this job if i dont have the kids confidence  now i get that this area of interest is uh  your blind spot but i want to help you so that the next time  a girl comes in here asking those  kinds of questions youll be prepared  im not saying you need to have sex  no no no no no thats not what you were offering  just why would you offer that  it wasnt what i was thinking  wishful thinking is all that was  i mean what this is all really about is  teenage girls feeling like they have no power  right and it makes sense too i mean look at their  role models you know youve got britney spears and her shaved head  lindsay lohan looks like something out of lord of the rings  ann coulter  lets work together to try to find a way  to make them feel more confident about themselves  yeah i like that  yes we will change the world one girl at a time  well be like a girlsaving team  and maybe along the way we can find  a way to help you too  madonnas ray of light intro begins  pulsating rock beat plays    zephyr in the sky      at night i wonder      do my tears of mourning      sink beneath the sun      shes got herself a universe gone quickly      for the call of thunder      threatens everyone      and i feel like i just got home and i feel      and i feel like i just got home      and i feel    song ends  sloppy freak show babies  mewhere in the english countryside  in a stately manor home madonna is weeping  hit the showers  sniffing  oh hey william  i thought i smelled cookies wafting  from the ovens of the little elves who live in your hair  wow sue im really impressed  yeah well madonna is legend  and i want my girls to learn  all the lessons she has to offer  strength independence  nobody quite like the material girl  to empower my cheerios  just like your hairdresser has empowered you  to look absolutely ridiculous  ill see you later sue  you think this is hard  im passing a gallstone as we speak  thats hard  what comes to mind when you see that name  genius  icon  hall of fame milf  so were all aware of madonnas  musical and cultural significance  which is why this week your assignment  is to come up with a madonna number  all gasp yes yes  puck uh mr shue  as a dude madonna makes me kind of uncomfortable  finn yeah shes smokin and everything  but cant some of us do something else  like the guy version of madonna  like you know pantera  guys you know its come to my attention  that many of you havent been treating  the young ladies of our group very nicely lately  youre disrespectful bullying  sexist and i hate to say it misogynistic  i have no idea what that means  when i pulled my hamstring i went to a misogynist  what it means is put yourself in their shoes for a change  culturally madonnas legacy transcends her music  because by and large the subtext of her songs are about  being strong independent  andand confident no matter what your sex  but more than anything madonnas musical message  is about equality  and that is something i ink you guys need to work on  mr shue i dont think we can have an honest conversation  about ms ciccone without acknowledging  that her images are as indelible as her songs  i would like to honor her contributions by tackling  a multimedia project  with mercedes will great  go for it kurt  im still not down  and no chick intimidates puckzilla  i just dont think her music  translates to show choir  really well i for one  couldnt disagree more  whispering express yourself go       come on girls  do you believe in love  cause i got something to say about it  and it goes something like this    dont go for second best baby      put your love to the test      you know you know youve got to      make him express how he feels      and maybe then you know your love is real      you dont need diamond rings      or 18karat gold      fancy cars that go very fast you know      they never last no no      what you need is a big strong hand      to lift you to your higher ground      make you feel like a queen on a throne      make him love you till you cant come down      dont go for second best baby      put your love to the test      you know you know youve got to      make him express how he feels      and maybe then youll know your love is real      and when youre gone he might regret it      think about the love you once had      try to carry on      but he just wont get it      hey     hell be back on his knees so please      dont go for second best baby      put your love to the test      you know you know youve got to      make him express how he feels      and maybe then youll know your love is real      let him know your love is real      youve got to make him express himself      hey hey hey hey      put your love to the test     so if you want it right now      make him show you how     make him show how he feels      express what hes got      oh baby ready or not      express yourself    thats what im talking about all right  ok smokin hot madonnas burning up plays  guess who im dating  who wes brody  hes super cute  he plays soccer with my sister  hes seven  oh crap  i need a younger inferior man  if i dont find one  coach sylvester will kick me off the cheerios for sure  hello finn  his birthdays like three days before yours  and hes

high time you lost the big v  everything about you screams virgin  youre about as sexy as a cabbage patch kid  its exhausting to look at you  well look i appreciate the offer  but i have feelings for someone else  and im trying to work things out with them so  who rachel  shes dating that jessie kid from vocal adrenaline  no shes not  please you can smell it on her  shes like a cat in heat  she talked about him yesterday and practically  sprayed the choir room  so come on  lets do the deed  itll be great for my image  and sue will promote me to head cheerleader  its winwin  wait what what do i get out of it  i dont know  you get to have sex and make rachel jealous  i meant for me okay  its winwin for me  you wanted to see me  sue clearing throat  um yeah thank you for coming  please sit down  no  burning up plays faintly in distance okay  um i was just wondering  why madonnas playing everywhere except my office  well its simple arlene  you dont deserve the power of madonna  you have none of her selfconfidence  her power over her body  or her sexual magnetism  simply put you have all the sensuality  of one of those pandas down at the zoo  who refuse to mate  i had your uh intercom disconnected  burning up plays fullblast then muffled  there you go  finn i was just coming to find you  look i know that the boys were a little uncomfortable  about this madonna assignment  so i figured you and i as cocaptains  could do a little mashup of a bunch of her songs  just to show everyone how cool it can be  yeah sure whatever  look are you still dating that jessie kid  no no  whowho told you that  look i know things have been weird between us  but i never thought youd lie to me  look please just dont tell anyone  unbelievable  we may not be together  the way that jessie and i are  but we can still be friends  iim asking you  as my friend to trust me  fine but if this leads to something bad for all of us  dont expect any more friendship from me  noted  all right lets

that madonna song  a new one  wait you two are cheerios now  yeah ive decided to add vocals  to my already wildly overproduced cheerios numbers  itll give us the edge at nationals  you guys couldve at least given me the headsup  you mean the same way you gave us a headsup  before not giving us a solo almost every week  kurt mr shue mercedes and i  talked it over and we love being in glee  but being in the cheerios will give us  more opportunities to shine  so were doing both  ah chipper up tiger  you know i was down at the pharmacy today  and theyre having a monster sale on dep  dep is a hair gel  and once again i am making fun of  your incredibly stupid hairdo  buzzer sounds  girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short  wear shirts and boots cause its okay to be a boy  but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading  cause you think that being a girl is degrading  but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you  what it feels like for a girl  slow pop rhythm begins    silky smooth      lips as sweet as candy      baby      strong inside but you dont know it      good little girls they never show it      when you open up your mouth to speak      could you be a little weak      do you know     do you know      what it feels like in this world      for a girl     for a girl      oh      for a girl      in this world      do you know      what it feels like in this world    music fades  i am not down with this  i like being a dude  thats because its easy to be a dude  uh mr shue i think were gonna need a new baritone  cause finn would like to become finnessa  wait hhold on puck  finn has a point  i mean havent you notid  how low morale has been around here lately  artie i have  i think the way i was objectifying tina  may have sent her over the edge  school bell ringing  hey girl  my eyes are up here  i am a person with feelings get out of my grill  i am a powerful woman  and my growing feminism will cut you in half  like a righteous blade of equality  weve been treating the girls like crap  not caring about their feelings not listening objectifying  thats the right word right mr shue  thats right objectifying  as an honorary girl i have to agree  this team shouldnt work but it does  because we respect each others talent  and if we want to take it to  the next level we have to start  respecting each other as individuals  really see each other
