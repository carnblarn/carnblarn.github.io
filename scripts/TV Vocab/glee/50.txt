didntd  an assignment to work on this  you just did it  mr schuester while the performance was excellent  particularly the drumming  dont you think that the subject matter  is a little inappropriate  well that depends on  what pucks intent was when he chose this song  i guess i just uh dig van halen  all right  rock on  yep good job guys  glee s03e06 mash off   burt hummel hes running for congress  last year he had a heart attack  he might have had a heart transplant  and he might have got it from a baboon  baboons are dangerous killers  who throtheir own feces when theyre not tearing off  peoples faces or admiring their own weird butts  congress is bad enough  if burt hummel thinks what washington needs is  more baboon parts then he needs a brain transplant  watch out baboons  burt hummel and his baboon heart  wrong on the issues wrong for ohio  im sue sylvester  i have a human heart and i approve this mes  the man had angioplasty  shes telling lies  shes playing dirty and shes getting away with it  okay will breathe deep breathe deep breathe deep  we have to play nice  because if you win by fighting dirty its not really winning  thats what we teach our students  right  what youre doing is appalling  do you know  my dad actually has a baboon heart  its not personal porcelain its politics  and politics are  all about playing dirty  you should know  your squeakyclean campaign for class president  is getting a good ol fashioned country shellackin  yo fellow americans  okay listen  a vote for brittany is a vote for  root beer water fountains and robot teachers  did you say robot teachers  yep radical  ive always wanted one  and also listen  rachel berry is still on myspace and thus unfit to lead  thats ridiculous  brittanys making promises shcant deliver on  its lying and no one is even on myspace not even rachel  it doesnt matter  brittanys got their attention  and youre playing all nice campaigning for  a salad bar in the cafeteria  its boring its tired its not going to get you elected  well obesity is a huge problem at this school  especially in the gleelub  have a seat yasser  you know why i fight dirty  because im fighting  for something  i have a cause several actually  i hate the arts  and a bunch of other stuff  if you want to win find yourself a cause my friend  then start flinging poo  winning is really about poo flinging  i refuse to believe that  i agree that perhaps i need a better cause  but im going to win this thing without having to fling  a single stinky nugget  well good luck with that son of burt baboon heart hummel  its not personal  hey shelby whats up  we havent talked since  mercedes and santana and brittany  left new directions  i hope you know i kept my word  i know  you didnt recruit anyone  it was it was me  they left because of me  no no its not your fault  theyre talented they just want a chance  to take center stage during their senior year  did you get your letter today  about sectionals yeah  figures wed be up against you  dont forget the dulcet dazzlers  so lame  you know we may get along but the kids wont  i mean its going to get ugly around here  its the last year for a lot of them and they want to win  well maybe competition will bring out the best in them  or maybe itll turn into world war glee  we usually do mashups around this time  its always my favorite  everyones so happy  so you can still do it  you know maybe theres a way  to work with all this fighting spirit  get the kids to channel it into something great  talk to me  what are you doing here  shelby told us she had something to show us  what are you doing here  mr shue said the same thing  let me guess he wants to combine choirs for sectionals  well its not gonna happen  the trouble tones are here to stay  so why dont you shuffle  your busted choir off our stage  look you guys we can compete without being enemies  all right we dont have to get vicious  oh i think we do soft serve  fierce femme phenomenal  oh and guys hurry up go get some moist towels  we have to keep finn wet before we can roll him back in the sea  okay you know what santana finn is in great shape  and your meanness only highlights  your own personal insecurities  and rachel your mustache is thicker  than a middle eastern dictators   its been a long time since i came around    its been a long time but im backn town    this time im not leaving without you   is this what having a stroke feels like  because i like it   just you and i   sharing our love together   and i know in time   well build the dreams we treasure    well be all right just you and i    something something about this place    just you and just you and i   something bout lonely nights    and my lipstick on your face   just you and i   something somethg about   my cool nebraska guy   you and i   yeah something about   baby you and i   oh you and i   remember our first embrace   the smile that was on your face    the promises that we made   ooh   and now your love is my reward    and i love you even more   than i ever did before   something something about this place    just you and just you and i   something bout lonely nights    and my lipstick on your face   just you and i   something something about   my cool nebraska guy  i love you you and i   put your drinks up   for nebraska  for nebraska   for nebraska nebraska   i love you   you and i   you you and i   nebraska   id rather die   without you and i   we made it   you and i  mr shue shelby i think we can all admit  that that was weirdly amazing  buwhat exactly was the point  that sometimes bringing together two conflicting things  can create something totally unexpected  were not combining glee clubs mr shue  thats not what im talking about  shelby and i agree that with sectionals  coming up for both of us its time we all got serious  with some friendly competition  each groups going to  put together their own mashup  to perform headtohead  for the first annual  mckinley high mashoff mashoff  yeah come on now  get you some lets do this  thats pretty good right    they were out of apples in the cafeteria  thank you  i want you  im your teacher  youre my sub  you cant deny the chemistry  im not some kid im 18  ive already been with a lot of older women  look noah you are very charming  and surprisingly set  the kiss was a mistake  well that mistake meant something to me  i felt something ive never felt before  im in love with you  oh god  wait i made a list  of the reasons we should be together  youre hot  im hot  beth needs a dad  and why shouldnt it be her actual dad  look me in the eye and tell me you dont feel something too  you want a mashup  were the ultimate mashup  two things that maybe shouldnt work together but do  i would lose my job  only if i told and i never would  you have a crush  its sweet and its normal  and youre gonna get over it  i dream about us being together  a real family taking stupid pictures  for our hanukkah cards  renting an rv and all of us hitting coachella  whats up with that crib you ordered  is it still in pieces all over your living room floor yes  see you need me i can help you with stuff like that  let me take care of it this week  no thats not gonna happen why  because youre afraid you wont be able to resist me  i know thats why you havent had me  back to babysit since we made out  you know this is gonna happen  okay guys we have our work cut out for us this week with this mashoff  and the trouble tones have a lot of powerful voices  so song selection is key here any suggestions  what about the clash uh the police  rem no  spice girls jonas brothers  guys no no we cant use  any of those bands  the only thing they have in common  is that they all broke up  and right now the new directions need to feel united  i like what youre saying finn  its not just about the music but where it comes from  who do you think we should use  how about this people think hall and oates are  famous for their cool puffy hair  and that dudes banging stache awesome  but also theyre awesome  for staying together over the long haul  just like us despite all their differences  i think we should give the solo to the new guy  get him prepared for whats in store  when the stakes get high  rory i think youll do a good job  thanks finn but i dont think im ready for that honor just yet  come on youre totally ready rory  youll kill it well all help you  its a great idea finn  thanks  im losing patience  why hasnt child protective services done anything  to shelby yet i dont know  wait did you do something to screw this up already  you have to be extra nice to shelby  so that we can babysit more  because weve hardly been over there  and we need to spend as much time bonding  with our baby as we can so that when i get her  she doesnt freak out when i hold her  im being really nice to her believe me  look this isnt a game okay  i know shelbys threatened by me  but i am willing to do whatever it takes to get closer to her  because closer to her is closer to beth  i would like to join the trouble tones  i have to think about that  thanks a million finn  i just want you to know that no matter what  i have your back  like when that girl with the lips was saying  you look like a whale i wanted to tell her that i think you look fine  im just sick of her  talking smack about me you know  have you ever heard of the term trash talk  is that when you discuss trash  no in sports its when one player insults another  to try and get them off their game  and santanas trying to demean us  to get inside of our heads so that we remain losers  well its time to start getting inside of hers  hey there orca  hey santana you look like an assless jlo  youre skinny like all the crops  failed on your familys farm  that is the lamest thing i didnt  understand a word of not one word  is that really all that you can come up with  you seriously think that you can outinsult me  im from lima heights i was raised on insults  its how mi abuela put me to sleep at night  and she is not a nice lady  you know she tried to sell me once  and it wasnt till i got to kindergarten  that i learned my name wasnt garbage face  then well have to settle this another way  uh today after school  bring your trouble tones  are you suggesting what i think you are  yeah i am  dodgeball  hey rachel  hi  as you might have heard  im applying to the new york academy of dramatic arts  ugh all the girls who beat me out in the auditions  when i was in new york they all graduated from there  well my grades are perfect  and i was the lead in the school musical  and i plan on winning the election  for student class president  so i just need a letter a killer letter of recommendation  wait youre asking me to write it  actually ive ive already written it  so all you would have to do is just sign and my resums  in there as well with the letter so  i thought that you know your pedigree  as a national champion showchoir coach  would just make some noise with the admissions committee  makes sense  okay  okay bye  im so proud of you  you are truly a star rachel  and its all stillut there in front of you  im not going to be the first person  to be a little jealous of all the amazing things  you have lying ahead  im just going to be the only one whos also cheering you on  maybe you could come to my broadway debut  ooh dont try to stop me  maybe you could write your own version of the letter  its such an impressive resum  you have the musical and all the clubs and maybe even  student council president  i feel bad for all the kids that dont have these  bigticket items in their cvs  they dont have a chance in hell of getting into nyada  this could be deadly i mean facing our foes headon  without any adult supervision  so uh you know that our nyada applications are due next week  i only need one more letter of recommendation  i wrote to patti lupone on her web site  but i havent heard from her yet so  ii really i i really miss you kurt  and i just  i just i really want to be your friend again  well maybe you shouldve thought of that  before you walked all over me  in your

dude i love her she sounds like  what banana cream pie sounds like when it sings  i think its a great idea mercedes  i think that we could really kill with that stuff  agreed and now with that decision out of the way  i can stay focused on my onesided battle  of wits with the knuckledragger  santana the dodgeball thing was fun until the end but enough  no honey im just getting started  im the leader of this group and im telling you  lay off those guys  im sorry the leader  who died and made you queen aretha  i brought you guys in  and i came up with the idea for our mashup  while you were wasting time trying to figure out how  to make finn hudson cry  so i nominate myself as president of the trouble tones  all in favor  im not impressed by your campaign  you didnt put any posters up  four in favor means mercedes gets elected  and shes right we should all be focusg  on winning because were better not meaner  mr shue and i both agreed on the ground rules  we play fair  i just dont have time for this kind of thinking  well make time  because you are a star member of this group  and you need to represent   stop the violence  come on okay god okay  look ill play fair  from

i were him  because if i were her id stick  a stent in one of those boobs and let the finn blubber  light the hanukkah lamp for eight magical nights  hey santana  why dont u just come out of the closet  you know i think i know why  youre so good at tearing everybody else down  its because youre constantly  tearing yourself down because you cant admit  to everybody that youre in love with brittany  and she might not love you back  that must hurt to not be able to  admit to everyone how you really feel  you know what i think you are  a coward  see you at the mashoff  burt hummel claims he doesnt have a baboon heart  he also claims he isnt married to a donkey  well which is it burt hummel  baboon heart or donkey bride  donkeys have no place in politics  they bite off childrens fingers and pee absolutely anywhere  do we really need another washington politician  married to a pack animal  dont let burt hummel make an ass out of you ohio  im sue sylvester and its not personal

that ad was bulletproof  i accused burt hummel of using his tire shop  to sexually assault automobiles  whats not to like about that  hey ms c  quiet please children  welcome one and all  to mckinley highs senior class presidential debate  such a magnificent turnout reflects  this schools passion for democracy  it is against school policy  to pass gas into jars to be sold in the cafeteria  and now our first candidate rick the stick nelson  stick stick stick stick  so i was talking to my dad  who says that since he pays taxes and stuff  like for teachers which pretty much means that were your boss  so i think its time  that the teachers started doing what we say  and how about you stop talking in class mrs janicek  everything you have to say is boring  vote rick the stick  tornadoes are natures most destructive force  these violent storms have ravaged america  crippling communities all across our land  isnt it time we take a stand  if you honor me with being your next class president  i will make tornadoes illegal at mckinley  keeping you and your families at our school  safe from their murderous rampages  also on tuesdays uh i pledge to go topless  whoo  hello im kurt hummel  um the past few weeks  ive tried to address the real problem  of obesity at this school  but my opponents chose empty promises and smear tactics  although she knows it to be untrue my opponent brittany  stated that my face was used as a template  for hasbros successful line of my little ponies  well i refuse to be bullied  in fact i refuse to let anyone be bullied  today i want to take it one step further  i would like to hereby pledge to ban dodgeball  at mckinley high  since its invention in 1831 by silas w mangold  dodgeball has been used as  a schoolyard instrument of suppression  its violent its painful its humiliating  and i believe that its an equivalent  to modernday stoning  lets end dodgeball at minley high  and send a strong message that violence isnt okay  hello im rachel berry  and i have campaigned for president on a crusade  for school book covers  a plan to save the school thousands of dollars  knock it off  while i still consider this plan  an inspired stroke of political genius  i hereby withdraw my candidacy  and urge you all to vote for kurt hummel  hes the only candidate  here today who never went negative  hehes the one who deserves to be president  thats why iim casting my vote for kurt hummel  vote hummel mckinley  vote for kurt  whyd you do it  i should have withdrawn from the race  when i got the lead in the musical  you needed the resum boost  to get into nyada  youre already so spectacular  but being senior class president will just put you over the top  only rachel berrcould perk up an old boring high school debate  with such a riveting twist  drama queen i know  but i just ii hated you hating me  me too scowling gives you forehead lines  and im way too young for botox  i guess i was just you know focusing on my dream  of going to new york and getting into nyada but  then realized that part of that dream is going there with you  so now i am all about helping you win  consider me your campaign slave  im gonna hug you now okay okay  okay  thank you  so about the whole pastie thing  lets just quit while were ahead doll  hey i was i was in the neighborhood  so i thought id drop this off for beth   i just got her down so  i left a bunch  of voicemails trying to find a good time to come by  and you never gave me a straight answer  about when i can join the trouble tones  i dont think its a very good idea  well mr schuester wont miss me  i reached out to you  i came back here so that you  and my daughter could have a relationship  oh please i know all about the hot sauce and the book  and everything else you planted here  you think they were just gonna come here and find those things   and hand my baby over to you  shes my baby  you have no idea what it means to be a mother  its not about whose body she comes out of  its about accepting the fact that you dontatter anymore  that your feelings and that your life and that your body  they all come second to making sure that that child is happy and safe  is that why you gave yours up for money  at least i did what i thought was best for my baby  you were just a cash whore  i dont feel comfortable with you being around beth anymore  is puck going to get to see her  was he the one who told you were done here  i hope you this as a wakeup call  just because you take out your nose ring  and dye your hair blonde again doesnt make you any less lost  i think you need to stop making fun of finn  youre being really harsh  manatees have really thick skin  santana coach sue needs you in her office right away  whats going on  have a seat santana  im
