like a shooin for maria and kurts running for class president  so he can get into nyada thank you in advance for your votes  but brittany quit as his campaign manager so she can run too  im also a unicorn and ths what you missed on glee  five six seven eight  piano vamping  youre late  i know i overslept  its 430 in the afternoon  my alarm clock went off 30 minutes late this morning  kind of shifted my whole schedule  anyway whats santana doing here  ive resworn my allegiance to the glee club  without telling coach sue  mercedes ill catch you up  piano vamping five six seven  five six  mercedes you okay my stomach hurts  i think im gonna be sick why are you babying her  i mean she cant do three steps without puking  cause she ate at quiznos  before she showed up in this joint  mr shue you have us scheduled to the second right now  with school glee club and booty camp  when else am i supposed to eat  when the rest of us do oh like you eat  its not about eating its about attitude  sectionals are coming up and if we dont give it our all  i am doing my best  no youre not  its not about doing your best anymore  its about doing better   morning sunshine hey  do you want me to iron some bacon for you  um i was looking for a fresh box of cornflakes  and i found this  hidden way back in the pantry  its a stash of wedding magazines  wedding inc  modern bridal marry me monthly  oh wow  terri must have had a massive bridal magazine addiction  and an autographed headshot of vera wang  to emma always marry up  right thats slightly harder to explain away  look emma im not scared of your inner bridezilla  i mean thats clearly the road were headed down  and marriage is just one of  several milestones i look  forward to sharing with you  but because i dont like secrets  i thought id share my secret stash with you  i was a bachelor for over a year  kept me off of craigs list  okay well just put that over here  but emma i have to ask you a question  if youre serious about you and me  why havent i met your parents  bebecause um theyre dead  you spoke to them on the phone last night  i spoke to their ghosts last night  i have ghost parents  okay cant lie to

sr this is highly unusual  i have no grounds to drug test your son every day  my grandmother in china knew three english phrases  cocacola kiss my grits and harvard university  deep in hubei province this old woman knew  the best school in the united states  thats where my son belongs  but what makes you think hes on drugs  hes one of our best students  a football star and he can bust a serious move  my son got an aminus on his chemistry test  an aminus is an asian f  mr chang sr i dont want to get in your business  as they say but dont you think perhaps youre putting  too much pressure on

truthful  i think our little girls  all grown up  wow im so happy to hear that  i dont know what youre doing schuester but its working  well i have been pushing her pretty hard in booty camp  good good for mercedes  yes but very hard for us  laughter  i mean rachel is maria  isnt she yes  on the other hand  mercedes is  is the riskier choice no doubt  and she might even be the more exciting one

school bell ringing  coach beiste i have something very important we need to discuss    what is this are we having a romantic dinner sort of  i invited your parents over  is that my little freakydeaky  okay im gonna say hi in one minute  one minute one minute oh god oh my god  why would you do this i wanted to meet your parents  so i thought id take the bull by the horns  right its okay because maybe maybe we can get them to leave  i will pretend like um an ovarian cyst burst  works every time emma what is going on here  are you ashamed of me  no  im ashamed of them  what why  my parents are ginger supremacists  were not ginger supremacists  were more ginger preservationists  we dont hate anybody  we just prefer the company of other redheads which is why we  enjoy the red oaks so much whats the red oaks  its a gingersonly country club  its really the only place i feel i can be myself  and let my auburn hair down  did you know that if were not careful  redheads will be extinct in 30 years extinct  its a recessive gene if we keep heading down the road  were on with everybody just mixing with everybody  we gingers will cease to exist as a species  not really a separate species which is why id really love to hear about your heritage  i have to say your hairs a little wooly  for my taste but those beautiful blue eyes  are a very good sign now schuester is german right  ii think so  youre practically a viking  hey well thats a relief  theres got to be some red hair in that family tree  yeah not like that carl  oops looks like freakydeakys  coming down with a mean case of the cleanies  dont bother trying to stop her once she starts will  we used to tie her thumbs together and shed chew  right through the twine adorable  i think its weird i dont know where she got it  oh im sorry amigo  youre not our regular waitress  rusty cindy rose you cant be too careful  im sorry i dont mean to be rude but has anyone  ever told you that youre both a little racist  im sorry  excuse me its not racist to be proud of the heritage  that youre trying to preserve will  well maybe it isnt but all i know is that if emma and i  were blessed enough to have a child  i wouldnt care what he or she looked like and you know what  if my child had ocd id maybe try to show a little compassion  instead of calling her a name that makes her feel  like a freak  these beans are a disaster  rusty these beans are what happens when you sit out  an election rose there wasnt a ginger candidate  school bell rings  i think we should talk dont you  about the um upcoming deadline for the nyada applications  about you telling coach beiste that youre running for senior class president  against me kurt you saw mercedes okay  im not gonna get the part so i figured if i win  ill make you vice president and then maybe you could just do viceversa  rachel if you win yes itll better your chances of getting into nyada yes  but if i win it could make a huge difference at this school  not just for me but kids like me  things could actually change for them  so whatever it takes im winning  look i just i need something for my senior year  thats gonna make me special thats gonna make me stand out  i thought maria was gonna be that you understand  youre just as ambitious as i am thats why were friends  rachel in ten years when you look back on this time  youre not gonna be thinking about the clubs you belonged to  or the parts you had  youll be thinking about the friends you had and  and the ones you just tossed aside    please dont tell us that we have to try out again  no weve come to a decision  it was one of the hardest decisions of my life  and that includes when i had to sell  one of my two prize donkeys to pay my gas bill  i sold kim but i kept khloe  so um in the grand tradition of the special olympics  everybody wins were doublecasting maria  what the hell is doublecasting  it means that well both get to play maria  youll get your welldeserved standing ovations  on saturday matinees and sunday mornings for the retired  lima war veterans and ill do all the evening performances  actually rachel were adding a week  youll both get four nights and two matinees  fair enough  mercedes itll be a pleasure sharing the spotlight with you  are you doublecasting any other roles  no just no no  thank you for your time  where are you going  tell me you were better than me  tell me  stammers why is it that no one ever wants to hurt her feelings  you know its always been the rachel berry show around here  but its not gonna be for me no not my senior year  mercedes dont make this a stupid pride thing  oh its a pride thing but its not stupid  congratulations you got the part  i dont want it  school bell rings  i got it  i got it like by default  they doublecast us and then mercedes turned it down  so cool youre gonna youre gonna be withdrawing from the race then  look finn when brittany sang that song about girls changing  the world it got me thinking you know maybe  maybe i can change the world by being student class president  look make fun of it all you want but you need  to start thinking about your future too  oh did you talk to kurt about the election  yeah  he asked me who i was voting for  what did you say  i said i didnt know  emma  son of a biscuit ive lost count again  whispers one  two  three im so sorry  i shouldve believed you when you told me you didnt want me to meet your parents  i didnt get it  emma stop  please  come on lets go to bed  whwhat are you doing  im praying  i do it all the time in my head  but right now its just not enough  and when i need help i know god hears me better on my knees  something about the acoustics of the linoleum or something  sighs  i wish i could make things better for you i  i just dont know how  i dont have any clue what im doing down here laughs  but im willing to learn  piano ballad plays  when you try your best but you dont succeed   when you get what you want but not what you need   when you feel so tired but you cant sleep   stuck in reverse   and the tears come streaming down your face   when you lose something you cant replace   when you love someone but it goes to waste   could it be worse   lights will guide you home   and ignite your bones   and i will try to fix you     tears stream down on your face   i promise you that i will learn from my mistakes   tears stream down on your face   and i   lights will guide you home   and ignite your bones    ooh   and i will try to fix you    ms corcoran i hear youre starting a new group  youre going to need some star power so here i am
