look at you   you can do all i couldnt do   glinda     now its up   to you     ive heard it said   that people come into our lives   for a reason   bringing something we must learn   well i dont   know if i believe   thats true   but i know im who i am today   because i knew you   like a ship blown from its mooring   by a wind off the sea   like a seed dropped by a skybird   in a distant wood   who can say   if ive been changed   for the better   but because i knew you   because i knew you   i have been changed   for good   and just to clear the air   i ask forgiveness   for the things ive done you blame me for   but then i guess we know   theres blame to share   and none of it seems to matter   anymore   like a comet   pulled from orbit  like a ship blown   as it passes the sun  from its moorings by a wind off the sea   like a stream that meets a boulder  like a seed dropped   halfway through the wood  by a bird in the wood   who can say   if ive been changed   for the better   because i knew you   i have been changed     for good   thank you kurt  i see it now  i dont have to choose between  my career and love  because this  i mean this stage broadway new york  thats my

broadway blogoshere  and by broadway blogosphere  i mean the one blog that actually cares about broadway  can i give you a piece of advice  dont tell your kids  itll just shake their confidence at nationals  and they wont perform as well  i hate my kids  i would literally whip them if i could  every time i see them achieving  just reminds me of everything i missed out on  i love my kids  what no you dont  theyre hideous  my kids are at least attractive  yours look like they havent been baked properly  ive watched them grow into mature young men and women  and thats been the joy of my life  youre tearing up people are starting to stare  i bet they think i just broke up with you  see you on the ice schuester  all right guys whos up for some real  new york city pizza  we heard  heard what  about you leaving to be on broadway  look i havent made up my mind about anything  we get it  and were happy for you  youve inspired us in so many ways so  this is just another  i dont understand  whowho told you guys  goolsby  you okay mr shue  im not going  im staying with you guys  i had my moment on the stage and it was glorious  but you and i  have some unfinished business to take care of  now get out your notebooks  time to get to work  come on this is nationals people  yes puck i want in i want in  oh gee  we made it  were one of the top 50 show choirs in the nation  tomorrow only ten

good shot at winning this thing  all right everybody put your hand in the middle  one two three  new directions  yeah     peace up a town down  yeah what  okay  okay     lets go   yeah yeah yeah   yeah yeah   im in the club with my homies   trying to get a lil vi keep it down on the lowkey   theyre really good  cause you know how it is   i saw shorty she was checkin up on me   from the game she was spittin in my ear   you would think that she knew me   i decided to chill   conversation got heavy   she had me feeling like shes ready to blow   watch out down below  watch out oh   down below watch out  she was saying come get me   so i got up and followed her to the floor   she said baby lets go  baby lets go   when i told her i said   hey i gotta talk to you  hold on a sec  i do this thing where i get my kids to sign  a tshirt to send to all the teams we beat at nationals  yeah well dont bother getting us one  i have a sneaking suspicion that were about to kick your ass  youre about to go up against the top show choirs  in the country and your team spent all week  mooning about how fun and exciting new york is  youre a bag of meat  take a large youre about a large right  extra large what are you doing  buying you a tshirt goolsby  ill send it to you  after we win nationals  got the beat got the beat we got the beat   santana  oh shoving your fingers down your throat  like the rest of your brainwashed  vocal adrenaline brothers and sisters  im not throwing up on purpose  im so nervous i cant keep any food down  i used to love singing  it was the only thing that relaxed me  now i hate it  do you think im an idiot no  i think youre kind of mean but i dont think youre stupid  i know what youre trying to doing  youre trying to get me to feel bad for you  so that i dont try as hard to crush you on the stage  what did i ever do to you to make you hate me so much  when i came to your school i heard that the glee club  was where kids went when no one else would take them  a safe place  for some reason you made me the only one who wasnt safe there  where are you going  to the philippine embassy  im going to beg them to revoke my visa and deport me back home  thats the only way  im going to be able to escape vocal adrenaline  wait wait  its because youre good  thats why i hated you  thats why i sent you to that crack house  im sorry  but you have to go out there and sing  you have a gift  something that dustin goolsby would kill for  i cant im going to barf all over the stage  if you feel like youre going to throw up just look at me and ill help you through it  why  dont you want to win  guys like us have to stick together  im going to hug you now  and now our returning champions from carmel high  vocal adrenaline  what are you doing  im making something right  mmm   mmm mmm mmm mmm   mmm mmm mmm mmm   all my life   ive waited for the right   moment to let you know   i dont wanna let you go   but now i realize   theres just no perfect time   to confess how i feel   this much i know is real   so i refuse to   waste one more second   without you   knowing   my   heart   i dont need anything else   but your love   nothing but you means   a thing to me   im incomplete   when youre not there   holding me touching me   i swear   all of the rest could just   disappear   and i wouldnt even care   as long as youre there   as long as youre there     you wrote an amazing song finn  i didnt know you had it in you  who cares about the song  what i dont understand is all youve ever wanted is  for us to be together  and im basically standing here begging for you  and suddenly youre not interested  ii am interested  more than interested  this is my dream  being here in new york  im not gonna let anyone or anything keep me from it  im sorry finn  i love you  but  theres nothing you can say or do  thats gonna change my mind about it  and now from william mckinley high in lima ohio  the new directions  face to face   and heart to heart   were so close   yet so far apart   i close my eyes   i look away   thats just because   im not okay   but i hold on   i stay strong   wondering if   we still belong   will we ever   say the words   were feeling   reach down underneath and   i couldnt stay away  will we ever from the show or her  have a happy ending   or will we forever   only be pretending   keeping secrets safe   every move we make   seems like no ones   letting go   and its   such a shame cause if you   feel the same   how am i   supposed   to know   will we ever   say the words were feeling   reach down underneath and   tear down all the walls   will we ever   have a happy ending   or will we forever   only be pretending   oh oh oh  pretending   pretending   oh oh oh oh   pretending   was that scripted  no    hey hey hey   you and me keep on dancing   in the dark   its been tearing me apart   never knowing what we are   hey hey hey you   and me keep on trying to play it cool   now its time to make a move   and

large  i think we were good  good we were amazing  the kiss was interesting  yeah imim calling it the kiss of the century  youre wrong finn  that kiss was unprofessional  it was too personal and intense  the judges wont like it theyll consider it common  and vulgar and it cost you nationals hi rachel  you look amazing and you sounded great  just shouldnt have kissed him  why are you here jessie  for you  dude back off  youre just jealous  jealous of what we have  and what we shared with the entire audience  because it was shared between two people who love each other  it was the superman of kisses  itit came with its own cape right rachel  whatswhats happening  they just posted the top ten for showcase  everybody gather around its a moment  two years in the making okay what should we do  lets go look at it together  come on come on  come on come on  oh im too nervous to look  ill go  what did we place  well mr shue  say it what did we rank  we didnt  im so sorry you guys  we arent in the top ten  oh my god  you should have seen it  we all looked at the top ten list for showcase  and we all just went numb  and then jessie kept going on and on  about how rachel and finns kiss is what cost us nationals  while i understand passion i do think  that was unprofessional but sorry keep going  okay then we get back to the hotel and santana loses it  i mean and the plane ride was completely silent  like no one said a word  we all just sat there with our faces buried  in our complimentary copies of skymall  wait i dont get it you dont seem that sad at all  well it was still amazing  i mean i flew on a plane for the first time in my life  i had breakfast at tiffanys  i sang on a broadway stage  i love you  i love you too  you know when you stop and think about it  kurt hummels had a pretty good year  oh look whos here  hey what are you guys doing here  uh nothing just uh getting a coffee  we ran into each other in the parking lot  were on our way to get some sheet music  tomorrows my audition for the summer show at six flags  whereas im spending my summer composing pip pip hooray  the broadway music about pippa middleton  i have no idea who that is but it sounds totally awesome  well see you in class  bye bye guys  okay so here are the nominees for my songs tomorrow  i think i could probably  do you think they know  i dont think anybody knows  hey  you still pissed  do you think this voodoo doll looks enough  like rachel berry to actually work  come on we cant be mad at rachel forever  uh yes we can  how could you possibly be so calm  i dont know i hated losing just as much as everyone  but this year wasnt about winning for me  clearly cause we got our asses kicked  yeah  sorry  what was it about  acceptance  i know that all the kids in the glee club they fight  and they steal each others boyfriends and girlfriends  and they threaten to quit like every other week  but weird stuff like that happens in families  yeah well this is a club this is not a family  okay well family is a place  where everyone loves you no matter what  and they accept you for who you are  i know im going to be a bridesmaid at mike  and tinas wedding and im gonna be  anxiously awaiting just like everyone else  to see if their babies are asian too  when they find an operation to make arties legs work again  im going to be there for his first steps  i love them i love everyone in glee club  and i get to spend another year  with everyone i love so im good  what about you and i  i love you santana  i love you more  than ive ever loved anyone else in this world  all i know about you and i is that because of that  i think anythings possible  youre my best friend  yeah me too  when did you get so smart  where have you been  hiding out  everyone hates me  no they dont it doesnt explain why  you havent said a word to me since weve been back  cause you should be more pissed at me than anyone else  i screwed up  im humiliated we worked so hard  for everything  and i was supposed to be this big shot leader  holding everyone together and i blew it  cost us the championship  look being an artist  is about expressing your true feelings  in the moment no matter what the consequences  what were you feeling in that moment  that i loved you  and that i would have done or given anything  to kiss you one more time  so you did  you know you gave it all up for one kiss  yeah  was it worth it  yeah  what about you  was it worth it for you  yeah  cause i know in my heart  well have another shot at nationals  you have to know that i im leaving finn  im going to new york and im never coming back  graduations a year away  you got any plans till then  okay lets go  where are we going  final glee club meeting of the year  no other show choir
