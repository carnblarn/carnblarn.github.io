remember  so what once every blue moon  gus goes and visits an old cartel associate  that that doesnt help me  i cant very well hide out  in a nursing home for six months  hoping on the off chance  that he comes back  its not even like theyre friends  pinkman said it was like he was torturing the old guy  what does that mean  he told him the last of his family was dead  he seemed to enjoy telling him  afterward pinkman asked him about it  all gus would say was that this tio character  once murdered someone close to him  wait tio murdered someone close to gus  i know it sound not particularly fruitful  but sorry thats all i got  theyre enemies  not friends  your next number in this coverall game  where you cover the whole shmoley  is b number 3  like goldilocks and the three bears  thats number 3 in your b column  followed by o74  thats o74 on the other side of your card  now we have that lucky number b number 7  is it lucky for you b7  in the i row 21  i know you despise me  and i know how badly you want to see me dead  but im willing to bet  that i know a man whom you hate even more  those ns just keep coming  theyre all sticking together  i am offering you an

reading it correctly  is a 7200amp service  this place has two of them  all right  thats a whole lot of juice brother  laundry this size typically has maybe half that okay  so whats with the extra panel  what are you thomas edison now  no i asked a bunch of electricians  they have their own chat rooms  you know like where all they talk about was wiring  freakin internet find anything on it these days  what do you say  pop over have another looksee  listen  i think we possibly have a lead on something  yeah  i have this guy down at the office  he says he has some kind of information  the thing is hell only give it to you  in person  okay  remember hector salamanca  sh yeah  what you mean the old cripple guy with the bell  rather crap on our floor than talk to us  no i dont remember him at all why  well hes the guy  his nurse calls us  says he wants to powwow  so we have this guy at the office  for three hours  and he still just wants to talk to you  do not even think about going down there  marie  this is clearly a ploy  or a trick or something  designed to get hank out into the open  thats all this is  thats what we thought  well  its been years since this guys been a player  his nephews gone  doesnt have anybody  the nurse checks out doesnt know nothing  guess i just dont see an angle in it  if there even is one  of course if you did want to talk to this guy  theres not safer place than the office  i dont think this sounds like a good idea  yeah i agree uncle hank  it is a ridiculous idea  and there is no way you are going to do it  end of story  hank thanks for
