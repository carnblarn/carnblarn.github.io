study  so that i could work at home and you can write  nah i dont  i dont think this is gonna be enough  okay um what about a wine cellar  i mean we certainly cannot be expected  to live without a wine cellar  very funny mmm  i just think we need to set our sights high is all  at least higher than here  walt this is a good neighborhood  its got a good elementary  and supposedly a very good high school  and believe me  cause i have definitely looked everywhere  for our price range  this is as good as it gets  well then lets stretch our price range  truly  i mean why buy a starter house  when well have to move out in a year or two  did you win the lottery and not tell me  im serious  come on why be cautious  weve got nowhere to go but up  yeah  walter you see us  yeah i see you  id like you to exit your vehicle  and start walking toward us  and then what  im gonna need some  some kind of assurance  i assure you i could kill you from way over here  if it makes you feel any better  walter youve been busy  you want to put your arms out  to the sides for me if you would  you know i havent slept since thursday  i was out all night cleaning up after you  i need my sleep  you said no half measures  yeah  funny how words can be so open to interpretation  you get your car fixed  not yet  youre gonna want to get your car fixed  lets see how this goes first  has your condition worsened  excuse me  your medical condition has it grown worse  not that i know of no  is there a ringing in your ears no  are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices  im quite well thank you  no clearly you are not  no rational person would do as you have done  explain yourself  my partner was about to get himself shot  i intervened  some worthless junkie  for him you intervene and put us all at risk  some contemptible junkie  who couldnt keep the peace for eight hours  thats right he couldnt  he was angry because those two dealers of yours  had just murdered an 11yearold boy  i heard about it  he should have let me take care of them  maybe  then again maybe he thought  it was you who gave the order  are you asking me  if i ordered the murder of a child  i would never ask you that  where is pinkman now  i wouldnt know  a couple of time zones away at least  beyond that id only be guessing  he has enough money to last forever  he knows he needs to keep moving  youll never find him  i dont know walt  its what i do after all  hes out of the picture  i saved his life i owed him that  but now he and i are done  which is exactly what you wanted isnt it  youve always struck me as a very pragmatic man  so if i may i would like to review options with you  of which it seems to me you have two  option a  you kill me right here and now  apparently i have made that very easy for you  you can kill me no witnesses  and then spend the next few weeks or months  tracking down jesse pinkman and you kill him too  a pointless exercise it seems to me  but that is option a  what is option b  i continue cooking  you and i both forget about pinkman  we forget this ever happened  we consider this a lone hiccup  in an otherwise long and fruitful  business arrangement  i prefer option b  youd need a new assistant  i could get right on that  no  this time i choose  your car  get it fixed  yeah  really  its good to see you  thanks  its good to be back  well shall we  by all means gale lets cook  what about that rhinoceros  you think hed make a good pet  no no  dont you think if you called to him  hed come running for his supper  ill bet he would  i bet hed come running  youre silly pop pop  well a little  but hed probably knock everything over  plus theres that big nose of his  thats not a nose thats a horn  is that so  his real nose is little  huh  i learn all kinds of things being with you  okay june bug these are for you  what about the rest  the rest are for me  no theyre not  youre too old for balloons  oh youre never too old for balloons  give me a hug oh i see your mama

bianchi   ormai son pelato deluso avvilito   non so quali cure adottar   ma senti cosa dice   quel povero infelice   non ti lamentar   ma prova a cantar   con noi questa canzon   crapa pelada la f i turtei   ghe ne d minga ai sui fradei   oh oh oh oh   i s fradei fan la fritada   ghe ne dan minga a crapa pelada   oh oh oh oh   crapa pelada la f i turtei   ghe ne d minga ai s fradei   i s fradei

first  im not interrupting anything am i  no no not at all  please come in  can i offer you something crme de menthe  oh no no thank you  im sorry for the inconvenience  oh no no its no inconvenience  i need to talk to you about something  something rather pressing  if push came to shove i was wondering  how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself  you and an assistant  why would  why would push come to shove  has walter ever talked to you  about why he got into  this particular line of work  uh  i guess i assumed it was because  it pays so well  oh it is but specifically  has he ever spoken to you about his health problems  oh im not surprised  hes a very private person  what exactly are his health problems  hes dying of cancer  it is why he does this  to provide for his family  which he has accomplished  they will never want for anything  hes seen to that  well  how long does he have  that is very much the question  he does not want to talk about it  and every time i bring it up with him  hmm  i dont know that hes fully accepted  the reality of it  and not to sound coldblooded  but i am running a business here  no i i understand  i have  a very large investment in this  there is so much overhead  that i cant afford to shut down  not even for a week  so you understand my concern  and my desire for continuity  i do absolutely  now i intend to keep walter on  as long as he wants  assuming hes physically up to it  but as he cannot or will not  tell me how long that might be  i must prepare for the worstcase scenario  the worstcase scenario  uh  i suppose if we had  at least a few more cooks together  you dont think youre ready now  well he is such a  a master  theres always more for me to learn  but im thinking that if we had  say one or two more cooks  one more  i guess would do it  i suppose  i believe in you gale  i know that when the time comes  you will be ready  whats up  walt hmm  is there um  any particular trick  to purging the catalyst bed  no its pretty straightforward  ill show you when we get there  yeah  tell him im in conference  cant you see im in conference  im looking to find a client of yours  i was hoping you could help me out
