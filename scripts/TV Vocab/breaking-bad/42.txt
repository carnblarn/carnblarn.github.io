anywhere  one restaurant home one restaurant home  back and forth back and forth  which now im even more convinced  is bullshit because the man owns  13 other restaurants right  so i started thinking about this little empire of his right  fourteen restaurants who supplies them  whats the base of operations  so i do a little diggin and bingo  pollos hermanos has a main distribution center  uh its not far from town  the place is huge i mean  im looking at it online right now  i tell you its a big warehouse  and rows of these long poultry buildings  or hatcheries or whatever you call em  lots of space to hide illicit activity  sounds promising right  huh  so whaddya say buddy  got another field trip in you  uhh  you know hank um  i mean it sounds great  it really does but i  you know i wont lie uh  you caught me somewhat  indisposed  what do you mean like taking a dump indisposed  yeah thats  embarrassingly thats it  you know its just  upset stomach you know and everything   yeah  its out of control  really explosive  bad texmex   at the mall  yeah yeah yeah  i get it you dont have to paint me a picture  probably one guy in a diaper is enough for this trip anyway  yeah im sorry hank  hey dont be  ive been asking a lot of you lately  i appreciate it  ill find another ride for this one  another ride  yeah im sure i can get someone else to take me  uh my trainer chuck  maybe ill ask him  look im im  this is probably just a 24hour thing  maybe 48 hours at the most  and um  do you think you could possibly hold off  for a day or two  aw jeez buddy i mean i you know  you know

that much to you  just you know give me a call  when youre feeling up to it all right  thank you i will okay  bye   yeah  uh mike  listen i just want to say first off  dont be angry  what is it walter  my brotherinlaw  my dea he  soon he will probably  in the near future take a ride out to  a certain distribution center  to look around for things  look around for things and yeah  uh  mike   wheres this all going  elsewhere  youre all set  thank you please give this to your car care professional  so a hand wax for you today  okay great  please give this to your car care professional  and the black explorer  well of course we could shampoo your floor mats but really  deluxe detailing is the best bang for your buck  oh and suvs are extra  and please give this to your car care professional  thank you  please give this to your car care professional  hey sky  oh my god ted  what are you uh  someone from the office uh  said you worked down here so i thought id  come down and say hi  wow well uh  hello  you look great  no im gonna like  i probably just look crazed  not at all you look happy  last time i saw you  hi there  uh thing is  skyler um  i really need to talk to you  ted  i really dont think we have anything to talk about  actually we do  an audit  wait an audit tomorrow  how long have you had this  awhile id  debated you know contacting you  contact me what about a lawyer ted  ted this is  this is the cid  the criminal division  my god you facing a felony charge here  100000 fine on top of the taxes  you already owe plus  five years in prison  yeah its bad  yeah it most certainly is  look heres the thing  i was wondering maybe if um  theres some way you could help with this  help help how  well with your knowledge of how the books  got the way they are maybe theres some way  you could uh  undo whats in there  you want me to uncook your books  maybe theres some method or some accounting trick   you could you know use  ted  it doesnt work like that  the damage is already  my name my signatures  are all over those books  skyler im accountable not you  let me explain whats gonna happen here okay  once the cid sees this as willful tax fraud  there are going to build the strongest possible case  against you and once they start down that path  they have an 80 conviction rate  thats because theyre allowed to monitor your mail  and tap your phones and not just you ted  everyone involved in those books  i cant have this in my life  i cannot be audited  skyler you you  youre going to be fine okay theyre after me  its the captain they want not some cashier at a car wash  no offense im sorry  i uh  i dont want you to worry okay  im gonna figure out a way through this  somehow okay  here  right here  so is he gonna kill him  is who gonna kill who  gus  is he gonna kill mr whites brotherinlaw  i mean hes the reason for all this here right  because its totally logical for him to off the dude  ahole dea agent  pokin around your junk  who needs that right  makes sense to get rid of him  for good  but killing a cop  i dont know  it could look suspicious if uh  the dude whos investigating you  suddenly up and dies  then theres theres mr white  whod be even more ape shit  if he had family getting murdered  hed never cook for gus again  guess theres a lot of angles to consider  if something were to happen to the man  would you have a problem with that  who really cares what i think  son of a bitch  you get comfortable kid we may be here a while   hey  get down  s   should i even ask  i wouldnt  so what is this going to be a regular thing now  meth cooking and corpse disposal jesus  just grab us a spare barrel walter  what was it this time  what did this poor bastard do to piss off gus  or did gus just need to send another message  shut your mouth  you shut your mouth or ill shut it for you  i dont want you talking to me or jesse  just get the barrel  and if you ever plan on calling the cops  on one of my guys again  you go ahead and get two barrels  yo like uh  i guess i never thanked you for  what you did  thanks  next time dont stand there like an idiot  move your feet run and so forth  but seriously what  what was the deal with gus   the deal  the terminator shit  walking right into the bullets  what the hell was he doing  the cartel needs gus  his distribution network  theyre not looking to kill him  but what the rest of us are like open season  is he doing anything about that  or do we just keep hanging out  for target practice while hes  kid  enough you got questions  ask him yourself  and here again unreported income  thats more than a year straight so far  do you want to say something about this  because im having a hard time figuring it out  well i id have to um  have a look at the copies of the receipts  to refresh my memory  take all the time you need mr beneke  thats why were here  oh i am so sorry i am late  i got lost   hey ted  sky  whoo  this building is so confusing  there are doors everywhere  hi you are  special agent james bekaris  ooh special  skyler white  ms white you are the accountant  of record for many of these reports   is that correct  guilty as charged  well then perhaps you can shed some light  on this history of missing revenue  missing uhhuh   no its there  no  revenue most definitely flowed through this company  but its not all accounted for in your reports  huh  hmm lets take a look  hmm oh  well you know this account here  that is mr kellers account  and mr kellers an old friend of teds dad  and he always sends an electronic payment  which personally i hate  because im a real paper person  but mr kellers one of those environmental people  so anyway since there wasnt a physical check  i didnt enter it into the book but  the moneys there  ms white youve read section 61 of the irc  i did not follow what you just said  how gross income for a business is defined   youre not allowed to do that  well i think i am  no youre not  well you know what they say about opinions right  everyones got one  but seriously i am  look it doesnt matter if its an electronic check  or a paper check income is income  youre not allowed to not declare it  when i input everything into the quicken  nothing flashed red so thats gotta mean  its okay right  quicken uhhuh  you used quicken to manage books  for a business this size  i did oh do you guys use that here  cause it is the best  its like having a calculator on your computer amazing  ms white how did you get this job   oh ted hired me  no  i mean your qualifications  what are your qualifications  where did you get your training  ooh well i havent had any training per se  ive always been naturally good with numbers  got a good instinct for them  right teddy  right  this is all falling into place now  ms white i just have to ask  youre not managing accounts anywhere else are you  right now no  im a cashier at a car wash  im not really clear about what happened in there  what happened is good news  ignorance of the law does not equate to criminality  it equates to ignorance  look pay your back taxes pay the penalties  and move on from this just put it behind you  pay with what  i owe them 617000   what am i  look just figure it out  all right you just dodged prison  sell your assets get rid of the bmw  take out a second mortgage on your house  take a mortgage i have a lien on my house  i dont have any assets there are no assets   left to sell  ted  if you dont pay them they will reopen the investigation  and that little fiction i just spun up there  will completely unravel  you have to settle  wish i could  come in  i hope you brought an appetite  yeah i guess  mike mentioned you have some questions  yeah  well eat first and then well talk  right on  what am i doing here  i know you have concerns  what happened yesterday  to my man at the farm  it was a terrible thing  oh the dude getting his head blown off yeah  i have invited you into my home  prepared food  so we could sit and talk  discuss whats going on in this business  our business like men  and i will explain everything thats happening  i will answer your questions  but first i need you  to answer one question for me  can you cook walters formula  what  walters formula  can you produce this product  without any help alone  no  why  you asking me if i can cook mr whites crystal  without him me  the junkie loser you were about to waste  and dump in the desert a month ago  this is your plan huh  invite me in your house make whatever this is  be my buddy and and make me feel  important  then get me to keep cooking for you  after you kill mr white  you want to you want to talk like men  lets talk like men  you kill mr white youre gonna have to kill me too  that is not what i asked you  you are here  because circumstances with the cartel are untenable  and i need your help  i need you to help prevent an allout war  now if you would  answer the question  hey you uh you headed out  yeah  yo mr white hey uh  i really got to talk to you i i dont know  if youre with your family or whatever  but this is important so im hoping  you could come over  thank god come on in  you uh you want a beer   or something  no   should i sit down  oh yeah yeah  yeah sorry go ahead  okay so um  okay so  word has come down that they  they want me to go to mexico  theres some sort of war brewing  between gus and the cartel  word has come down  yeah the cartel has been messing with guss operation  like jacking trucks to like send a message  and you know yesterday that dude  we brought to the lab  i mean they shot him right in front of me  just blew his head open  some sniper nailed him from like a mile away  anyway theyve been holding them off  but between the cartel taking pot shots  and your brotherinlaw trying to throw a net  over the whole deal its like what do you call  a rock and a hard place situation  so gus is gonna cave  so the cartel wants half  of gus entire operation and they want  your formula and hes gonna give it to them  well i i gotta give it to them  i mean im supposed to go to mexico  and teach a bunch of cartel chemists  how to cook a batch of blue  you know gus doesnt trust you so  i gotta go i mean youre the chemist man  you know not me  lets say i go down  to you know go over there go to the jungle  or or whatever  you know and say they got like actual chemists  like cartel chemists asking me chemistry stuff  that i dont know how to answer because im not you  and what if like all the equipment  is uh is in mexican instead of english  you know oh  i dont know i dont know  i mean if i mess this up  i am dead you know  all of us  so i look i i need your help  okay maybe you could  maybe you could like coach me  or something you know  or you can give me some notes  mr white  so you saw gus  what no  you didnt see gus no  then who told you all of that  it was passed down like i said  passed down  by whom  by uh by mike and them  they did they  so they doesnt include gus  you havent been with gus  you havent seen gus you havent spoken to gus  why are you  you werent at guss house last night  what  what the hell  jjesus  its still here   its still here  oh jesus  you look me in the eye and you tell me  that you werent at his house last night  i um  look i didnt have a chance  all right  okay i knew you would react this way  i knew you would freak out  and wouldnt believe me  thats why i didnt say anything  look there was just this one big pot of stew okay  he just made this one big pot  and we both ate from it what was i supposed to do  huh poison myself  two hours and 18 minutes  and you couldnt figure out a way to give it to him   he never left the room  you lying little shit  you had one thing to do  one thing that is the only thing i might add  that would save our lives  right there you were in his house  and you didnt have the guts to do it  two hours and 18 minutes  you never had any intention of killing him did you  how did you know i was at his house last night  were you following me  this this is how i knew  you bugged my car   two hours and 18 minutes  but you had no intentions did you  not the slightest intention  everything that i have done for you  you put a bug on my car  im sorry after everything youve done for me  what youve done for me  youve killed me is what youve done  youve signed my death warrant  and now you want advice  all right ill give you advice  go to mexico and screw up like i know you will  and wind up in a barrel somewhere  oh god  can you walk  yeah  you get the fuck out of here and never come back  ohh
