because youre an unpleasant person  mr wolynetz you were rude to me  and disrespectful towards my husband   skyler  and furthermore  ive met with quite a number of sellers  and the market seems much softer than i thought  so 800  you are talking crazy  uhhuh  you are a very very crazy lady  well i understand that youre disappointed  but that is my final offer  im sorry we couldnt make it work  goodbye  what are you doing  im negotiating  why  because i want to pay less  oh now  79000 less  who cares do you know how much i make in a day  yeah but thats the very reason  we need to negotiate

that thing that worries me  is is getting trampled  or or shoved up against a chain link fence  because if you really think about it  if you were against a chain link fence  and youve got a a lot  i mean a lot of people trying to escape  pushing hard enough forward  its not a joke youre going to get squeezed  right through the chain links  like pladoh or some kind of soft meat  uh and this is inevitable okay  and theres nothing you or me or anyone can do about it  and if the fence posts are stuck deep  really deep with the cement way down inside the ground  then its definitely happening to you   blood on the wall  yeah  bitch  somebody got shot somebody probably got shot  like soft meat man  right through  being squeezed through there like soft meat  like soft meat right through the

im waiting for your unemployment check to come  so i can pay the phone bill  i asked for an extension from the power company  why because on paper we have no money  you are completely overreacting  im not apologizing  for wanting to celebrate in some small way  im not asking you to apologize walt  im asking you to be smart  i bought one bottle of champagne  one single bottle skyler  i paid cash thats it  thats all it takes okay  i mean look at watergate  one one little piece of duct tape   left in a door  oh my god  brought down the president of the united states  what im nixon now  no what im saying is  the devil is in the details okay  one little mistake one slipup in our story  that could ruin us  fine  got to destroy the evidence  when i look at this this image  that is part of the record  i am very concerned about what sort of distraction  that can be  whether its from any sort of signage  but especially a signage  thats changing every five seconds  thank you  any other questions  we have a motion and a second on the floor  to grant the appeal  all those in favor  raise your hand and say yes  yes is for the affirmative  those opposed  theres five nos and that motion fails  i would like to make a motion  to uphold the decision
