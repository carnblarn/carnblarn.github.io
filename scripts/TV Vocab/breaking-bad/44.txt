to call you at home  but i think maybe youre not getting my messages  that or you just dont feel like talking to me  volume decreases  anyway why ive been calling  is because that thing we discussed  well ive been thinking and uh  i decided i cant do it  i know thats probably not what you wanted to hear  but hopefully youll understand  and if you wanted to talk some more about it  thats fine  so call me im around  knocking on door   hey  hey  come on in  clears throat  first i want to tell you that i get it  from what youve told me  this situation with walts gambling  soundsintense  yeah it definitely was  and continues to be  so i would greatly appreciate it  if you would just help me out here  well i have thought long and hard about this  and uh  heres what i want to do  clears throat  so is uh walt gonna be okay  are you in contact with him  um hes fine  good thats good  he doesnt know about you offering uh  no absolutely not  and i mean to keep it that way so  617000  written out to me  uh what is this   i cant take your money  oh  and why is that  because at the end of the day  paying my debt with illicit gambling winnings  i dont know it feels wrong  it feels wrong   to me it does  uhhuh  im not judging you or walt  im just saying i feel uncomfortable with it  well um ted  the whole reason were in this mess  is because you had me cooking your books  so when did wrong  suddenly become a problem for you  now hold on that was a onetime measure  i took an honest attempt to protect my employees  and save my dads company  and it mightve been a mistake  but thats no reason to go out and make another  no ted this is the big mistake right here  you owe the federal government 617000  if you do not pay them they will come after you  and then they will come after me  and if they audit my business  find out that walt and i paid for it  with close to a million dollars  in untaxed gambling winnings  we will go to prison  where you will already be  do you understand  i understand youre upset  but i think youre overstating things too  no ones going to prison  oh my god how are you not following me here  okay fine  lets say i take your advice  i pay the irs then what  then you dont owe them  okay but i still owe the bank skyler  im still gonna go bankrupt  ill lose my business and my home  i still have to pull my girls out of school  just because i pay some stupid fine  doesnt make my life any less ruined  so if im understanding you correctly  youre saying you cant take the money i gave you  but you can take a larger amount  no  im just saying  as much as i appreciate the gesture  the money you gave me doesnt really change anything   because its not enough  no no  dont twist my words  this isnt about amounts  this is about me doing the right thing   ted are you blackmailing me  what  no blackmailing  god  i feel like im not explaining things right  i think youre explaining it fine  i notice that uh  this is for  less than what i gave you by the way  thats the mercedes i leased it before i knew where the money came from  mmm and now that you know you will of course be returning it  well the leases are pretty ironclad  so i have to see whats possible  but yeah im gonna do my best  and i will pay you back as soon as i can  i dont want you to pay me ted  i want you to pay them  but skyl  try it again write a new check   skyler  same amount
