buddy were going to be here you kidding me  it is a full petct correct  you definitely want the petct and not just the pet  its a petct  good thats what you want  some places skimp  and they only do the pet  im not naming any names but  i just still dont understand why you dont go to kleinman  this is where walts doctor is  with us you wouldnt have to wait until next week to get the results  im sorry but these scans are not that difficult to read  i could take one look at walts and tell you immediately how hes doing  really  doctors like people to think that theyre so much smarter  than the technicians but you would be surprised  how much they come to us for input  never turn down a chance to hit the bathroom huh  excuse me  you all right in there  you okay  im fine thank you  sir you can go back to your changing room and get dressed  so howd we do  you did fine   see anything  im just a technician mr white  dr delcavoli will go over the results with you next week  sorry

me move the keys in the first place   remember  i see your point  your imbecility being what it is i should have known to say  dont leave the keys in the ignition the entire two days  i wanted to leave them on the counter bitch  oh im sorry the work station  all right so we need to jump the battery somehow  how  you going to be okay  damn it  whats it taste like  bad huh  this is good right here  there  here red to red black to black  positive negative  all right start it up  the hells wrong with this thing  you have to really pull  i am  really pull not like a girl  you know what pull

thats what i know  there was a fire excuse me for thinking on my feet  is that you were thinking now that we have identified the problem  you and thinking thats the problem  look somebody is going to have to pick us up  your wife is not going to notice one little call  mr white come on  all right look  make it snappy   the roaming drains the battery  all right  yo skinny hey  listen i need you to come pick us up  now all right were stuck out here  you got a pen for directions  a pencils fine retard  just something to write with it doesnt matter  all right so you ready  so youre going to head west on the 40 for like what 30 miles  and youre just gonna go past the casino with the big arrows in the parking lot  big arrows giant arrows they light up and blink and shit you cant miss them  but then youre gonna want to take it slow because theres this  dirt road right before this white sign with a 3 on it okay  now youre going to be way way out in the boonies okay  like crazy far so you just got to keep heading down that dirt road for what  about another 15 miles  really that far  hurry up the battery  just go down that road for like 15 more miles  i mean were way the hell out here  and yo listen  bring water  leave now  here  hes coming  there was this guy on the discovery channel  who broke his leg mountain biking  and he had to drink urine for  you know just until the forest ranger found him  he said it tasted like really hot  really old soda  we should just call  you know ill be quick just be like  yo where are you  all right  come on  yo where are you  so you saw the white sign  hes almost here  oh man  were getting really freaked out  all right so youre on the dirt road  hes on the dirt road good  you just crossed the river   have you seen anything  wait wait what river  what river what the hell river you talking about man theres no river  can you  phones dead  now what  what now  come on seriously  whats this  im trying to  tricklecharge the battery  seriously  just by turning that thing  the commutator  its the part which generates the electricity  usually this little  piston engine turns it  but considering its lying here completely totaled  anyway  apply a little elbow grease  itll take longer  a lot longer  but theoretically  it should work  theoretically  it has to work  you understand  can i try  how much longer  i dont know  you hanging in  im good  its got to be ready by now right  give it a little longer  just to make sure were  methylamine doesnt spoil does it  thats not why were here  lie much  push  come on  please  god  please  why couldnt i have just gone to santa fe  why  what are you doing  i had this coming  what  i have it coming  i deserve this  you snap out of it  first off everything you did you did for your family  right  all i ever managed to do  was worry and disappoint them  and lie  god  all the lies  i cant even  i cant even keep them straight in my head anymore  you know what  screw this im walking  you can come or not  wheres my other shoe  your body  is running dangerously low on electrolytes  sodium potassium calcium  and when theyre gone  your brain ceases to communicate with your muscles  your lungs stop breathing  your heart stops pumping  you go marching out there  and within an hour  you will be dead  you need to cut out all your loser crybaby crap right now  and think of something scientific  something scientific right  what come on  youre smart  you made poison out of beans  all right look  we got an entire lab right here  all right how about you  take some of these chemicals and mix up some rocket fuel  that way you can just send up a signal flare  or you make some kind of robot  to get us help or a homing device or  build a new battery or  wait no  what if we just take some stuff off of the rv  and build it into something completely different  like a dune buggy  that way we can just dune buggy  what is it  what  do you have any money   change i mean coins  i got a bunch of them  then gather them  and washers and nuts and bolts and screws  and whatever little pieces of metal we can think of that is galvanized  it has to be galvanized or solid zinc   solid zinc right  and bring me  brake pads the front wheels should have discs  take them off and bring them to me  brake pads   what are we building  you said it yourself  a robot  a battery  move  this doesnt look like any battery i ever saw  well trust me it is a battery  or rather one cell of a battery  here cut up the last two sponges  remember the electrolytes  think about it  a battery is a galvanic cell  its no more than an anode and a cathode  separated by an electrolyte right   right  well anyway  on one side we have mercuric oxide  and graphite from your brake pads  this is the cathode  this is the positive terminal  this is where the supply of current flows out from  you see  then  here ill show you on the opposite side is our anode  this  its zinc  its what we find in our coins and anything galvanized  so the sponge is the electrolyte  no the potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte  but yes thats what im soaking the sponges in  good  good and now  what shall we use  to conduct this beautiful current with  what one particular element  comes to mind  a wire  copper   well i mean  its copper  the only question now is  will this supply enough current  and how many cells will we need  maybe weve only got material enough for six  put the lid on wait  positive  cathode  anode  damn  that is good  thats very good here we go  hows the  its fine  i know i can trust you to  whatever happens  your family will get your share  so  ill be hearing from you  hows everyone doing  is that baby ever going to come out you think   i know enough already its  im teasing  everything in its time  walt i have your scan results  and youre showing signs of remission  my god  i want to clarify  there are some misconceptions about what remission signifies  it does not mean that the patient is cured  to classify someone as in remission  we only need to determine that the tumor hasnt grown  that it hasnt grown jesus  technically speaking  a tumor can remain the exact same size it was before  and the patient could still be in remission  now in walts case with a stage 3 adenocarcinoma  i like to see i hope to see at least  a 25 to 35 reduction in tumor mass  something to tell me that the cancer has responded to the therapy  everybody still with me  and how has my cancer responded  your tumor has shrunk by 80   my god  wait im sorry im really  im confused isnt 80 a lot  mom    okay but im  sweetheart you were right   its very good news  its very good news  are you kidding me  just when i try to get out they pull me back in  now that cough is the other thing we need to discuss  according to your scan walt you have radiation pneumonitis  its okay this is fairly common  see that scarylooking thing there  thats tissue inflammation thats a reaction to your radio therapy  its usually not serious but it can produce a cough like that  ill prescribe some prednisone  tissue inflammation  are you sure about that  because the other day  i was coughing up some blood   what  you probably have a tear  in your esophagus from the coughing and that can be very serious  you could rupture and bleed to death  were going to have to deal with that before you leave here today  wait a minute when did this happen why didnt you tell me   im sorry i  no more secrets walt  with something like this you have to call me immediately  now with these results were not completely out of the woods  but now at least we have some options  the most important of which is time  well have more to discuss in the next few weeks  but for now id say that you folks have earned some celebrating
