right now we really  cant say  forgive me granted this is not my field  but isnt it possible that this had something to do  with all the prescriptions ive been taking  theres the antiemetic  the antitussive  the this the that  not to mention the chemo itself  and being off all of them for the past few days  i have to say im feeling  much better  and when we pick up these medications  the

talking about days weeks months  look doctor i feel fine really  now if this is truly necessary  cant i continue as an outpatient  a fugue state is a very serious event  what if you were to disassociate while driving  what if you were to get into a situation where you could be shot by the police  you understand we cant allow you to leave until were certain what happened  was a nonrecurring event  saying you feel fine doesnt solve this  would you tell me about patient confidentiality  its very straightforward  without your permission i cant disclose anything you tell me to anyone  what about my family  not your family not to the police not to anyone  the only exception would be if you threatened to kill someone  then id be able to tell that person but only that person  and you as a medical practioner  you abide by these strictures absolutely  all right  there was no fugue state  i remember everything  the truth is  i couldnt stand to spend another second in that house  i just had to get out  and so i left  i didnt think about it i just did it  i walked for a long time  and when i couldnt walk anymore i hitchhiked  i got as far as gallup and  then it was just
