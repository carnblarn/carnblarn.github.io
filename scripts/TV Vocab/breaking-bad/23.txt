apologies gustavo  of course you should have been advised  its your territory you had a right to bless the order  but  we had no reason to believe the man was of concern to you  indeed he is  so youre in business with this heisenberg  i dont know him by that name but yes  ive made no secret of the fact that  i have always done business with certain local manufacturers  you and i we still make money together  its never affected our relationship  don salamanca had a nephew named tuco  yes i knew of him  then perhaps you know don salamanca mentored him in the business  thought of tuco as a son  when don salamanca was no longer able tuco took over for his uncle  he was a key man in our organisation north of the border  he was loyal  this heisenberg walter white  he was one of tucos local suppliers  until he betrayed tuco  so now you see blood must be repaid by blood  tucos cousins here  they have the right to exact vengeance  the salamanca family the cartel  everyone stands shoulder to shoulder on this  don salamanca  gentlemen  i feel your loss deeply  please accept my condolences  i have no issue with your right to vengeance  but i am presently engaged in business with this man  when our business is done  he will no longer be of any concern to me  until then  i need him alive  excuse us  i dont tell you how to fry your chickens gustavo  you should really leave matters of my organisations politics to me  do i not run my own territory  of course you do  and i will advise them to be patient  but i recommend you finish your business with the man quickly  or you risk losing the good graces of the cartel  that would not be wise  and those boys inside  i cannot guarantee that they will listen  they are not like you and i  if youre trying to sell me something ive got four words for you  do not call list  however if youre cool leave it at the beep  if youre trying to sell me something ive got four words for you  do not call list  however if youre cool leave it at the
