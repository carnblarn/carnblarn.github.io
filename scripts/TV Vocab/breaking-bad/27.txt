                why  why is this still under discussion  i dont like him  i dont care who he knows  were supposed to trust him with our products  big man  big generalissimo  big fry cook is more like it  the chicken man  you will do what you want  but you have my vote  never trust a south american  dirty dirty people  he broke my toy he broke my toy  he was just having fun  youll get over it  no i hate him i wish he was dead  marco  grab your old uncle a beer would you  no no a cold one  this is what you wanted  your brother dead right  youre going to have to try harder than that  if you want to save him  how much longer do you think he has down there  one minute maybe more maybe less  family is all  hey you got nothing on me yo  all right you can call my lawyer saul goodman  talk to my lawyer all right  you hear me i got nothing to say i told you you can call my  christ  you got my cell phone number my wifes name how did you do it  talk who you working with  yes sir  if youre ready to talk  they wanna get a statement  your side of what happened here  or we can hold them off till another time  maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer  there it is  yo adrian  rocky called he wants his face back  come on i gotta cheer you up  you see that thats your getoutofjailfree card  you understand getoutofjailfree card  i mean just blink once if youre following  the deas worst nightmare is that face out in public  theyll have to steer a wide berth of young master pinkman  for fear of the pr poop storm that will rain down on them  if this story ever gets out i mean this beating  best thing for you  youre home free  good right  right  oh my god  youre now the cute one of the group paul meet ringo ringo paul  this is i  jesse im i am so sorry for this this should not have happened  but it did  no thanks to you  but the plan did work  we wouldve been locked up right now if we didnt lure him away but this  this i just  i never saw this coming  so  what  what happens now  what happens now  ill tell you what happens now  your scumbag brotherinlaw is finished  done  you understand  i will own him when this is over  every cent he earns  every cent his wife earns  is mine  anyplace he goes  anywhere he turns  im gonna be there  grabbing my share  hell be scrubbing toilets in tijuana for pennies  and ill be standing over him  to get my cut  hell see me when he wakes up  and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat hole is left for him  after i shred his house down  i will haunt his crusty ass  forever  until the day  he sticks a gun up his mouth  and pulls the trigger  just to get me out of his head  thats what happens next  my advice  thats probably not a good strategy  theyre scared of you right now they want nothing to do with you  but if you hit them  theyre forced to hit back hard  i mean they will turn over every rock hither thither and yon  until someone spills the beans on you and anyone associated with you  present company included  yes i think what saul is saying makes a lot of sense  jesse move on with your life  leave it behind all of it  nothing changes  once i walk out of here  i get myself a new rv and go start cooking again  how exactly do you think  youre going to get away with that they will catch you   so what  what  i have a getoutofjailfree card  hey i may have overstated the power of your face  not this  if the cops catch me  i give them what they want the most  you  they nab me  i make a deal  to give up the great heisenberg  and his milliondollar drug ring  youre my free pass  bitch  youre so sure  look if he didnt give up my name while hank was beating him  hes never going to talk  what do you think that was a bluff  he wants your brotherinlaw and theres gonna be lawyers  creaming their underoos for a case like that  id take it myself if it wouldnt cause so much collateral damage  and him cooking again  hey when not if he gets caught and hes facing 20 years  whatll he do then believe me theres no honour among thieves  except for us of course  no hell  hell come around  and if he doesnt  there may come a time to talk options  options  im convinced mr pinkman was involved  in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl2 methamphetamine  specifically what we call the blue meth  i tracked him to a scrap yard  where he stored an early80s camper  an rv  while waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle  which i believe to be a rolling meth lab  i received a telephone call  telling me my wife marie had been injured in an accident  upon hearing the news  i left mr pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife  arriving at the hospital i learned the emergency call was a hoax  my wife fortunately was unharmed  so i immediately went back to the salvage yard but the rv was gone  most likely destroyed on site  and it was at this point you drove to the home of jesse pinkman  i think were done here  agent schrader needs to get home  get some rest  thats fine but just to confirm youre taking the fifth here  yeah thats correct  okay well  we just wanna give you all a heads up  mr pinkman is pressing charges in this matter  hes given a detailed version of events as he sees them  the word of a meth head  we know all about his history  were well aware but toxicology on pinkman  his blood is clean hes not using  the kid is even refusing his doctorordered pain meds  far as we can tell  so  where do we go from here  a couple of gentlemen from opr will come down  probably tomorrow morning  janice will give us an exact time  and you men will be continuing your investigation so   thanks for your time  right we just  we need one more thing  a photo of agent schraders hands for the record  yes of course  bandage off if you would  on the table is fine  flat on the table thats fine  its all gonna work out  youve been too good to them for too many years  i hope it goes without saying were not talking to anybody about this okay  okay  marie  who  hi  do you have a minute  sure  i guess crime does pay  i dont suppose you just came by to insult me  no we need to talk  you heard about hank  about what happened with this jesse pinkman  yes i know  whatever hank was investigating  him trying to find an rv  is there any danger  that could lead back to you  no  why would it  is this why youre here  im here to talk about hank  you know whats gonna happen to him if this pinkman presses charges  hank could lose everything  i thought maybe  theres a way you could help him  how  contact pinkman  get him to drop the charges  i dont know what kind of relationship you picture me having with this person   im not asking  he was hes hes not my friend   its not as if we were even close  im  im not asking  but there must be something you could say  isnt it even worth a try  hank is your family  not currently  what  i said not currently  im late i have to go  hello  i was starting to get worried  car trouble  oh thats a bummer  you should call me next time ill pick you up  no sandals today  i just thought  a bit more professional  well everything is on track  we got our distillate just waiting to  lets get our trays ready   clean no moisture  done  is our  our solvent filtered  i thought you might ask that  done  thats good  thats good  hand in glove thats what we strive for  you know this might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship  so you the gentlemen  lucky you boys caught me i got a load to pick up in memphis  i can hammer it out in about 15 but theres this girl lolly maybe fran  shes got this fetish she likes to get peed on  i was hoping to see her tonight but she wants to sleep before 10  so i wanna wrap it up here asap because traffic can be a wild card  thing is women who like to get peed on tend to be from the warmer climates  youd think the ones in colder zones would be more inclined  maybe its a shock if the bodys not acclimated  but you know i leave that for smarter minds than me  science is a mystery  well take a gander prices are negotiable  buying in bulk gets you a discount im running a special on these honeys  jhps hollowpoint bullets known as black death check it out  like that so sweet you wanna lick it  nickelplated brass casing lubalox coat

not an easy decision but it is one that i have to make  im sorry  this whole gale situation hes  hes just not working out  yes now  it may sound unorthodox  but i think our first best option  is jesse
