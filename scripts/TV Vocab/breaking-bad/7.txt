                in closing i can tell you we take this very seriously  apd as well as the dea  stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines  remains one of our highest priorities  and the theft of lab equipment from your school is also receiving  our highest attention  rest assured no stone will go unturned  in our search for the person or persons responsible for this  if you have any questions now would be the time  youre talking like you havent caught anybody yet  what about the janitor that was dealing drugs at the school  there is no indication that this individual was selling drugs  he was arrested for having a small amount of marijuana in his car  not in the school  and hes since been fired  i heard he had a record  id like to know how he got a job here in the first place   why wasnt there a background check  there was one  were currently reviewing our hiring policies  you better be doing more than that he was arrested in front of my daughter  this guy was stealing the lab equipment right  thats not our thinking at this time  we are looking at others who had access not limited to the maintenance staff  are you saying there was a breakin do we know exactly when this happened  i mean could it have been during school hours  we havent been able to establish a date or time  but there is no sign of breaking or entering  whoever took it had a key  were talking inside job someone whos still at the school  at this time im not able to discuss the details but what i can tell you  is that we have some very good people working very hard on this case  im sorry officer but that sounds like doubletalk  were trying to protect our children you have to level with us  really we are giving you all the information we have  you know what id like to see in this school drugsniffing dogs  yeah dogs and metal detectors  and locker searches and strip searches   our district has strict policies  i heard about this school in canada  they arrested one of their groundskeepers with drugs  and the next day they found out over half of the students were high on lsd  lsd when were you gonna tell us about the lsd  no please no one said anything about lsd  what about the equipment that was stolen  the equipment was taken from our chemistry department  and i would like someone to give us some specifics  walt  yeah  mr white is currently on medical leave  but as hes chair of the science department  hes made a very special effort to be with us here  and id like to take a moment to thank him for that  could you please tell us more about the equipment that was taken   please  yes  and thank you  the inventory list for the missing labware is as follows  one 5000 milliliter  round bottom boiling flask  one kjeldahlstyle recovery flask  two fullface respirators  some sep funnels  a sill head with a thermometer holder  ow my knee  where did that come from  and why was it so damn good  because it was illegal  the basement  unfinished of course  but just look at all this space  you gotta think rec room media room  just imagine all the things you could do down here  now remember youre buying for this fantastic neigorhood  big lawns and shade tress  walking distance to the country club  what happened there  bit of a fixer but this house has great bones  you know what were zeroing in ive got another listing  brandnew right around the corner  hi  hi  its by appointment only  im here to see the owner  hes in the  recreational vehicle  yo its appointment only  how you feeling  about as good as you look  jeez you look like lex luthor  listen i visited you in the hospital but you were asleep  yeah skinny pete said you wanted tucos address  acting like you were all out for blood  you are alive so obviously you wised up   no i did go see him  bullshit  are you selling your house  i got two dudes that turned into  raspberry slushie and flushed down my toilet  i cant even take a proper dump in there  the whole damn house has got to be haunted by now  you didnt actually go see tuco  here  that is seventeenfive  your half of the 35000  plus theres an extra 15 in there its all yours  youve earned it  you got this money from tuco  yeah  so tuco gave you this is what youre saying   we made a deal  you made a deal   thats right  wait  why would you make a deal with that scumbag  you see what he did to me  because i think that we can do business together  we came to an understanding  no way man okay no understanding  take a look at the money in your hand  now just imagine making that every week  thats right  two pounds a week  without even talking to me you told  this insane ass clown  deadeyed killer that uh  that we would give him two pounds a week  well just scale up our operation   well add a few more hours  dont talk to me about hours  what about pseudo man how are we gonna get that  you think the meth fairy is just gonna bring it to us  it takes me a week to get this stuff  im driving all the way out to las cruces  to meet up with my smurfs   smurfs  dudes who go to the drugstores  and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell them to me  and thats maybe only good for like maybe a halfpound worth  see

realistically it may just mean that weve got the antiemetics tuned right  truth is until walts finished this round of chemo  and we look at a new pet scan we just cant say for sure  isnt there anything else we could be doing  ive been wondering about  alternative medicine  i mean eastern healing  you know holistic  well i cant speak to its efficacy  but as long as it doesnt interfere with our treatment  anything that helps my patient have a better outlook  a better comfort is fine by me  so youre saying its all psychological  it doesnt make any real difference  having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference  but its also important that we manage our expectations  what  a junkyard  let me guess you picked this place  whats wrong with it its private  this is like a noncriminals idea of a drug meet  this is like oh i saw this in a movie oh look at me  so where do you transact your business enlighten me  i dont know how about taco cabeza  half the deals ive ever

for a newborn baby  yeah  you know i think she got that at gertrude zacharys in nob hill  i mean that thing must have cost like what  500 or 600  you know what i think im going to return it  you sure  shes bound to find out  well maybe i can explain to her that we need a diaper genie more than  a white gold baby tiara  you know ive been thinking about what you said to dr delcavoli  about alternative medicine  dont worry im not going to mention that anymore  what i mean is that maybe there is something to it  here look  they do this navajo sweat lodge up by farmington  healing ceremony  its supposed to be good for your lungs  im not saying that i believe in it but  you know it might be an experience  really  you  in a sweat lodge  i was thinking about driving up on friday  coming back sunday i mean if youre okay with it  well of course im okay with that  okay   sweat lodge  yeah  im already sweating help me out   okay  right  excellent  this is excellent very good work   damn straight  okay hydrogen  electrolytically produced yes  yeah like you asked i mean  this crap wasnt easy to get  it was expensive  methylamine wheres the methylamine  i dont see the methylamine  yeah well thats where i ran into some trouble  what kind of trouble  well half this crap i could just buy right  but this methylamine  not so easy  they got it locked down tight  but i did find some pros who will rip it off for us  but they want 10 grand  so whats the problem you have the money  no had i already spent almost the whole wad  i mean i got like 2 grand left i told you all this crap was expensive  so these thieves did they say where they would be stealing it from  yeah a chemical supply place south of town  they got guards and security cameras  big ass steel doors  thats why these dudes are charging so much  what  so why dont we just steal it ourselves  yeah  how are we going to do that  with this  so whats this stuff called again  thermite  and that will cut through a lock  because this is supposed to be one big ass lock  in world war ii  the germans had an artillery piece its the biggest in the world  called the gustav gun  and it weighed a thousand tons  and the gustav was capable of firing a 7ton shell  and hitting a target accurately 23 miles away  i mean you could drop bombs on it  every day for a month without ever disabling it  but you drop a commando  one man  with just a bag of this  and he could melt right through  and destroy that gun forever  jeez  so yes  i think it will cut through any lock were likely to find  youd like to return this  its very nice but yes  well it is from the store isnt it  oh yes its from this store  do you happen to have a receipt  no i dont it was a gift  a gift  mr wilson could you step over here please  mr wilson id like
