just slip out of your butt  thank you i know what ebola is now tell me  what would a west african virus be doing in our lab  so youre chasing around a fly and in your world im the idiot  jesse listen  this fly no any fly cannot be in our lab  its a problem its a contamination  and that is in no way a misuse of the word okay  so in terms of keeping our cook clean and our product unadulterated  we need to take this very seriously  now do you understand  so is that your flysabre  this is a swatter  and it happens to work quite well thank you  hey what happened to your head  nothing im fine  you didnt hit it like really really hard  my head is not the problem jesse the fly is the problem  you didnt happen to maybe try our product did you  jesse i know this seems unusual to you a layman  a fly

fly  what fly all right  where the hell is this fly not like i even seen the thing  maybe your positive pressure blew it out the door or something  no no it is here it is around okay  hes around and i am not going to expose this batch  to the open air and contamination period  now you can leave me to deal with this myself or you can help me  but you are right were running out of time  so i need your answer right now  okay  hey ticktock yo  look i like making cherry product but lets keep it real all right  we make poison for people who dont care  we probably have the most unpicky customers in the world  no no no no rationalizing  well find it any minute dont give up  did you know that theres an acceptable level of rat turds  that can go into candy bars  thats the government jack  even the government doesnt care that much about quality  you know what is okay to put in hotdogs huh  pig lips and assholes  but i say hey have at it bitches because i love hotdogs   and you know see what im

yo  ill give him that  look  i feel like im running out of ways to explain this to you  but once more i shall try  this fly is a major problem for us  it will ruin our batch  and we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook  failing that  were dead  there is no more room for error  not with these people  all right how about we go get some air  get some air  your answer to were sliding headfirst  into a massive crap  hey hey hey mr white  all right i understand that the fly is a serious thing now  all right im on board  im just saying you know maybe if we went and got some air  it

all this  here how about this  nontoxic glue strips  yeah baby its got pheromones all right i got a buttioad  we hang them up all over the place it wont be able to resist  i sure hope we have enough  im gonna go out on a limb and say yeah  do you see him  how long do you think youve been awake  why do you keep asking me that  just figure you know you could use some coffee is all i know i could  how about it  yeah   you take cream and sugar  black is fine  why dont you just leave him be  let the traps do the work  these pheromones are supposed to kick ass  bet we catch this mofo any second  thank you  you ever have like a wild animal trapped in your house  not that i can recall no  we did this one time back when it was my aunts house  back before she died of cancer  it was a possum big freakyiooking bitch  hey since when did they change it to opossum  whats up with that i mean when i was coming up it was just possum  you know opossum makes it sound like hes irish or something  i mean why they gotta go changing everything  whatever its just big rats anyways  giant pinktailed rats with their pink rat faces  totally freaky like alien rats  actually its not so much that he got trapped  but he was living there you know under the house  you could hear him going from like room to room  always scurrying around  sometimes id see him outside at night and it would just you know freeze  i mean its like youre not looking right at it right  i mean it thinks its fooling you  thats what they do i mean they play dead or whatever  its just so lame  is there a discernible point to this story  a point that youll be arriving at sometime in the near future  it was just a total bitch to get out you know it took forever  guy came set all these traps and all and he finally got it  but my aunt you know she didnt believe it  i mean she kept insisting she could still hear the thing  i mean you could not tell her any different  she started keeping an old umbrella you know by her chair  man she would just bang on the floor and yell at it  even gave it a name  it was scrabble  yeah that was it  you know scrabble just knock it off  she got like that toward the end  got obsessive about stuff just got mad about stuff  we didnt know what was up  it wasnt like her to be that way  but it turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain  and that was why  it metastasised  but it was good that that was when we decided to take her to the doctor  because then we knew what was up  you know got her some treatment  meds so she wasnt stressing all the time  it was a lot better after that  you know she was a lot happier  where the hell is he  ive been to my oncologist jesse  just last week  im still in remission  im healthy  okay so good great  well  no end in sight  thats great  well  i missed it  there was some perfect moment and it passed me right by  i had to have enough to leave them  that was the whole point  i mean none of this  none of this makes any sense if i didnt have enough  but it had to be before she found out skyler  it had to be before that  perfect moment for what  to drop dead  what you saying you wanna die  im saying ive lived too long  i mean  you want them to actually miss you you know  you want their memories of you to be  but she just wont  she just wont understand  i mean no matter how well i explain it  these days she just has this  this  i mean i truly believe there exists some combination of words  there must exist certain words in a certain specific order  that would explain all of this but with her i just  i just cant ever seem to find them  mr white how about you just sit down  you know i was thinking maybe before the fugue state  but before the fugue state i didnt have enough money  so no not then  and plus my daughter wasnt born yet  it had to be after holly was born  mr white  definitely before the surgery  oh christ  that damn second cell phone  i mean how could i possibly  i know the moment  it was the night jane died  yeah i  i was at home and we needed diapers  and so i said id go but it was just an excuse  actually that was the night i brought you your money remember  yeah i remember  but afterward i stopped at a bar  it was odd i never do that go to a bar alone  i just walked in sat down  i never told you  that you went to a bar  no i  i sit down and this man this stranger  he engages me in conversation  hes a complete stranger  but he turns out to be janes father donald margolis  what are you talking about  of course i didnt know it at the time  i mean he was just some guy in a bar  i didnt put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news  janes dad  i mean think of the odds  once i tried to calculate them but theyre astronomical  i mean think of the odds of me going in sitting down  that night in that bar next to that man  what did you talk about  water on mars  family  what about family  i told him that i had a daughter and he told me he had one too  then he said  never give up on family  and i didnt  i took his advice  the universe is random its not inevitable  its simple chaos  its subatomic particles in endless aimless collision  thats what science teaches us  but what is this saying  what is it telling us when on the very night that this mans daughter dies  its me whos having a drink with him  i mean how can that be random  hey come on hey sit down  no no no its  no no  no that was the moment  that night  i should never have left home  never gone to your house  maybe things would have  oh thought i was  i was at home watching tv  it was some  some nature programme about elephants  and skyler and holly were in another room  i could hear them on the baby monitor  she was singing a lullaby  if i had just lived right up to that moment  and not one second more  that would have been perfect  hes not coming down  must be thailandhot up there  thats why he likes it  thailands hot right  yeah  then thats why   oh jesus  hey hey wait here  hes not coming down  hes staying up there forever  what are you what are you doing  what do you think im gonna get that bitch  no youre gonna break your neck  yeah yeah just  no seriously youre this is a bad idea  damn it  jesse  just hold onto it  hold it still  jesse  im sorry  sorry for what being a lunatic  im sorry about jane  yeah  me too  i mean  im very sorry  its not your fault  its not mine either  its no ones fault not even hers  you know we are who we are mr white  you know two junkies with a duffel bag full of cash  like you said we both wouldve been dead within a week  but i miss her though  god i do  jesse  come down  wait im so close  let it go  we need to cook  what about the contamination  its all contaminated  all right well  i definitely scared him  probably stay out of our way  yeah  somebody got got yo  did you see that mr wh  bins are packed  bins are packed  hows the yield  twoohtwo and change  you okay getting home  yeah better thanks  maana then  jesse come here  i couldnt chance saying it inside  for all i know the labs wired for sound  that half a pound i said we were off by  now im not accusing you but if  you understand and if they ever found out  i didnt take shit  im just saying that i wont be able to protect you  whos asking you to
