                1 previously on amcs breaking bad  are you in danger  this is it right last stop  its like you wanted the kids a hero  its a story people would believe this is what we buy  to clean cars and clean money  gale boetticher he was a genius   im not sure i agree  what do you mean  this genius of yours maybe is still out there  no no no  hey chhchh   uh it its me  i i just wanted to say  that i was thinking about you and the kids  and uh  i love you  uh it its me  i i just wanted to say  that i was thinking about you and the kids  and uh  oh  mmm  ohh  morning  afternoon  oh really jesus  you shouldnt have let me sleep  you needed it  ohh  skyler i dont entirely remember  what happened last night  i mean if  i said something  did you know this gale boetticher person  skyler i cant even focus i dont  gale boetticher  did you know him  ha  oh my god what  what exactly did i say last night  just enough  did you work together  who killed him  was it the people you work for  definitely not  was it somebody who  at one point  might want to do the same to you  i seriously doubt it  no  ohh  god  oh god  i think i know what happened last night walt  mm i know exactly what happened last night  i drank too much wine  you told hank  that the man he was looking for  might still be out there  that it might not be this  mm  boetticher after all  and i was up all night  wondering why you would say that to him  because i was drunk skyler  no but then  but then i was remembering  your black eye  your uh business disagreement  that you dont want to talk about  i dont want to talk about any of this ever  the firewall all right  church and state  thats how we need to approach this thing  and then i remembered the message  you left me the other day  when you said you loved me  when i heard that i thought that maybe  you i dont know  that you were regretting whats happened between us  and i get that  after last night i  walt i think youre scared  i think that message was some  kind of goodbye  oh skyler  i think last night was a cry for help  oh jesus  cry for help  i think some part of you wants hank to catch you  wow  that is just  that is  that is it  exactly yes  youre like dr joyce brothers here  god  if he caught you  at least this would all be over  oh yeah thats a tremendous weight  just lifted off of me  now i i understand myself  thank you thank you  walt  ive said it before  if you are in danger we go to the police  oh no i dont want to hear about the police  i do not say that lightly  i know what it could do to this family  but if its the only real choice we have  if its either that oh  or your getting shot when you open your front door  i dont want to hear about the police  youre not some hardened criminal walt  youre in over your head  thats what we tell them thats the truth  that is not the truth  of course it is  a schoolteacher cancer desperate for money  okay were done here  roped into working for  unable to even quit  you told me that yourself walt  jesus what was i thinking  walt please  lets both of us  stop trying to justify this whole thing  and admit youre in danger  who are you talking to right now  who is it you think you see  do you know how much i make a year  i mean even if i told you you wouldnt believe it  do you know what would happen  if i suddenly decided to stop going in to work  a business big enough  that it could be listed on the nasdaq  goes bellyup disappears  it ceases to exist without me no  you clearly dont know who youre talking to  so let me clue you in  i am not in danger skyler  i am the danger  a guy opens his door and gets shot  and you think that of me  no  i am the one who knocks  ohh  look i was  skyler  here we are  just like you left it  and where is your pretty wife  she has other business to attend to  well like i say to her  place is as is understand  yes i understand  good good  i dont want her coming back with more demands  she she gave me hard time when we settled on price  were all on the same page bogdan  so heres everything you need  i keep very good files  thank you  so you are the boss now huh  you think youre ready  yes i i think so  being boss is tough  i know you think i was hard on you  but youll learn  being in charge is not easy  it takes hard work  youve seen me work hard bogdan  yeah i dont know  not so much maybe  but maybe when you are the boss  uh you will just keep your feet up  and relax  mm  the real important thing  and not everyone knows this is  is to be tough  a boss has to be tough  has to say no to people  has to make cashiers wipe down cars  even if they dont want to  can you be tough walter  i im sure you can handle  and if not  you can always call your wife huh  always sticky no problem  as is  whod have thought  that someday i would be handing these keys to you  many years almost forgot  bogdan  as is  thank you  you okay there  fine  its night im not using  eat something  yeah  thats right both of them  uh  im on my way  you need any help  no  you want me to call her back  no no  but what exactly did she say  uh exactly  just you know  she asked if i was okay and not to worry  like that  hmm  any uh rough timetable on this thing  or as to when shes coming home  uh its its about the gambling right  well its its kind of hard to  she she cant understand  it it its not like youre doing this on purpose  you cant help it  its no that simple  look you have a disease  it its like youre an alcoholic right  no its not not at all  yes it is i read online  shes not even allowed to be mad at you  and she cant be mad at you about the cancer can she  no son these are two very different things  not really gambling addiction is a sickness   you c  listen  what is going on with me is not about some disease  its about choices  choices that i have made  choices i stand by  youre not moving back in are you  no  hey  you know what  school can wait  why dont we take a little detour  what kind of detour  youll see  i think its time we got you your own car  what do you think  what  i i think if youre going to buy me off  buy me off  wow  its amazing its amazing  ah its goodlooking  im glad you like it  i i do thank you dad  all right youre welcome  so youre here  yeah  youre actually here to work  yeah man  jesus  jesse  come here  all right i need an update  update on what  an update on these little field trips  that youve been taking with mike  i told you already we pick up money  check on things stuff like that  and youre his bodyguard right  but what thats what you said  i said i guarded him like backup  like a second set of eyes  everybody needs backup right  and this has to be you  it cant be i dont know  tyrus or any of those couple dozen muscle heads  that gus has working for him  it has to be jesse pinkman  why  what is there something about you  that i dont know  are you a former navy seal  do you have to have your hands  registered as lethal weapons  register this  all im saying is that do you not even question this  do you really believe  that you mean anything to these people  and im not trying to be insulting  im just trying to make you see things clearly  i see they cant outright kill me  but they dont want me getting high  i see this thing probably started  as gus getting mike to babysit me  but you know what  i saved mike from getting robbed  even killed maybe  so maybe im not such a loser after all  i mean what if it  oh god  i mean what if  what if its all just a setup   what  what if this robbery that you stopped  wasnt even real  i mean think about it  your first day out guarding mike  he steps out for one second and what happens  you immediately get robbed  you are such an asshole  keep your friends close keep your enemies closer  like you said  gus cant kill you because of me  he knows i wont stand for it  he needs me and he hates the fact that he needs me  so what does he do he goes to work  driving a wedge between you and me  youre an asshole  if youd been there  youd know it wasnt a setup  wait a minute how long did those guys chase you  huh because the way you describe it  they gave up pretty damn

will you  we wont be too long  the crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo  to a couple of local nobodies  very disciplined though  not keeping anything for themselves  it was all about sending a message  which they did literally  it was written on the bucket lid  ready to talk  that i believe is the english translation  i know youre not really asking for advice  but let me hire 10  and we hit them back hit them hard  hit them where they live  no  this war stays cold for now  what about their message whats the answer  set up a meeting  lets see what they have to say  how did he do today  i

dad made sure  and i promise to always go the speed limit  or below way below  and it gets great gas mileage  so dad said i can take it around the block a few times  that okay  just around the block  yeah just around the block  and be careful okay  i will  bye  iit its really  its really great to have you home mom  hey seriously be careful okay  i will  okay  i guess we should talk  oh i think you

to know something  i want you to  i need you to understand  that you are safe  you junior holly  you are completely safe  everything that i do everything  i do it to protect this family  so buying that car  that was protecting your family  okay i uh  all right maybe its a little flashy  but he needed a car and  and im his father  and i should be able to get what he wants  it goes back tomorrow  skyler it will crush him  that car directly contradicts our story  and if youre so invested in protecting this family  it means protecting the story  what do you think the neighbors are going to say walt  what about hank and marie  how about the irs  what were you thinking walt  i was thinking  that i wanted to do something nice for my son  look  i just worry that hell blame you for this  oh he will  once again hell blame his bitch mother  for taking away what his loving father has given him  so thanks for that  but you know what walt  someone has to protect this family  from the man who protects this family
