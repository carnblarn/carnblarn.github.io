                previously on breaking bad  so where have you been this time  you gotta check out this crime scene  guess they pissed off the wrong guy  tuco killing gonzo means hes coming after us next  ive gotta get home my family   who is jesse pinkman  he sells me pot  what the hell are you doing here   get in      all right everybody listen up  tuco salamanca  for those of you not with us this morning we raided his headquarters  also his last known address  even the little den of iniquity he keeps for his meth hag girlfriend  we netted a bunch of his lieutenants the big man himself smelled us coming  so  study the face  study the file  get a big olraging hard on  at the idea of catching this piece of shit  my apologies to the hr department  grow tumescent with anticipation  all right  on the hit parade 1998  reputed to have whacked dog paulson back when our homegrown banditos  where wrestling the crank trade away from the so cal biker gangs  also were pretty sure he knifed a mexican national in 03  and for my money seeing how he customarily deals with rivals  id say he is a prime suspect  in the disappearance of our dearlymissed krazy8  hats over your heart for that dirtball  we hauled tuco in for questioning on that one  but as usual we couldnt make it stick  he runs a tight ship smug bastard  and even worse el paso says hes got some kind of cartel connection  i know its we all know whats going on down there  we sure as hell dont want it going on up here  which brings us to the good news  we finally got some actual honesttogod evidence  this is one of tucos henchmen street name no doze  found him tucked in the junkyard along with tucos own brotherinlaw  aka gonzo  gonzo this rocket scientist  was moving no dozes body  either hiding it there or pulling it out still not sure  when he got his arm crushed clean off  anyone wanna see the photos theyre on my web site hilarious  anyway the upshot is we got us a nice  big juicy bloody fingerprint  which belongs to seor tuco  christmas came early to the schrader household  that is provided we find this guy  so to all present  i ask you you wanna find this guy  what the hell was that jesus  wanna try

hair  hey its me  hey tim really appreciate you sparing us your day off  no worries happy to help  yeah this is helpful good   what about height and weight  five eleven  most recently about 170   i guess   he weighs a little less  thats fine thats close enough  good  what about other distinguishing features  tattoos or moles or scars   anything that might help us  tattoos  not really  thats fine   is that the list of medications  yes i wrote them all down  and theres no drug interactions none that are listed  i called his doctor so no  has he been depressed  hes been withdrawn lately a little withdrawn  last night he was  agitated  agitated  yeah when he came home last night he was  agitated upset  upset in general or upset because of something particular  when i asked him what was wrong he said  i dont know where to begin  then he just walked out of the bathroom  i was in the tub taking a bath  and when i came out about ten minutes later he was gone  nothing else missing  his keys wallet cell phone just what was on him  what about the phone call  im looking into it  what phone call  walts cell phone rang he pulled it out  looked at it and didnt answer it  but then a short time after he wandered out of the bathroom  i mean  couldnt that be  important right  anything else you can think of  anything else  i called the credit card providers  and theres no report  of any recent activity  lets see i checked with every hospital  within 50 miles every police station every morgue  so no i really dont i dont have anything else  i was actually hoping that you had something else  being that youre the expert   im sorry  no worries  i think this is good enough to start gives us plenty to work on  thank you  so that cell phone call shes talking about i ran it   and  never happened no record of it   second cell phone  yeah im thinkin  i understand  out  get away from me  settle down bitch  you gonna shoot me  shoot me in here  i hope i bleed like a mother too  that way

hurt himself  i mean he just doesnt strike me as the type  hell turn up  okay the whole tiara thing  i just find it bewildering that  you didnt believe that  not now  empty your pockets  thought your name was heisenberg  walter hartwell white  heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym  a business name  i like doing business with a family man  theres always a lot of collateral  answer me one thing  can i trust you  yes absolutely  sit down  dea  hit my place of business this morning  about a hundred cops looking for me  you two havent been talking right  picked up my whole crew top to bottom  everybody except gonzo  thats weird right  i mean  dont you think that thats weird  thats weird yes  unusual  unusual  last two days  i couldnt get gonzo on the phone  hes been acting all pouty on account of no doze  explain to me  how is it my fault  that that little bitch did not know his place  i saw this coming  i can see the future you know  its this gift that i have  deep inside my head  i knew last night they were going to come and try and bust me gonzo  he went and snitched to the cops  that lousy son of a bitch  i trusted him like a brother  i was good to him i was good  i see gonzo im going to gut him  im going to skin him  and im going to stuff his hide for a heavy bag  and every time i hit him  its going to be like a lesson to myself  you never never trust the people that you love  so you plan to ice gonzo  like future tense  what  youre saying  youre saying that  gonzo is currently  operating as a police informant as far as you know  im very sorry to hear that  thats disappointing   id waste him too yo  shut up  theyre out there looking for me right now  they got ghetto birds and black ops  i need to get high  i need to get good and high  whats with this gak it smells like headcheese  its killer  yeah seriously  so i was thinking last night  i came up with this great idea  mxico  mexico  well disappear way out in the jungle  well set you up in a superlab  well do nothing but cook 247  and nofederales are going to mess with us because i got my people there  connections  were going to make  beaucoup bucks heisenberg  i have a wife and family  so what youll get another one  i dont want you to take this the wrong way but i cant just  uproot my life like that  yeah man i mean me neither  whos talking to you  you need me man  cause i cooked that scante in your hands  ill tell you something yo  you never tried nothing like it  stink or no stink  one bump  youll be flying high for days  its a new product him and i been working up  careful when you hit it  it kicks like a 12gauge when it comes on  its got a secret ingredient  what secret ingredient  chili powder  i hate chili powder  this blue magic this is money  you keep cooking this heisenberg  were going to rewrite history with this  all right  time to clean the menudo out from between your ears  no i need him tuco  i need him very very badly  hes my partner  and if he doesnt go  i dont go  ill tell you this my cousins are driving up here  right now to smuggle us back down and theyre going to be here by sunset  and youre going to be on that truck or youre going to be dead  and you  you better hope they got room in the trunk  where are you going  louis is taking me to the train station  well put these up  no no honey no ill do it  he wants to help let him help  i mean how long has it been since youve slept  yeah shes right sky why dont you lay down a while  for christ sake you got a bun in the oven  i got my cell if you need me  bye sweetie ill see you later  all right bye  actually  i think the very fact they havent found him yet  bodes well  well i mean if he  you know  somebody wouldve smelled something by now  theres got to be something some detail that we havent picked up on  what about the second cell phone  aw jesus  we cant just ignore a potential clue hank  okay what are you talking about  the call you said walt got before he disappeared  theres no record of it with the phone company  no incoming no dropped calls nothing  but his phone rang i heard it  well all right well then if thats the case  he must have a second phone  why what sense would there be in that  all right okay im not here to argue with you  no hank you cant just bring up secret cell phone and then drop it  what does it mean  i dont know sky what do you want me to say  it means walt has a secret  everyones got one from somebody big or little  everyone  skyler come on  he kept cancer from you for weeks  then lets assume therea second cell phone  so what is he having an affair  walt please  what about the marijuana  hes not on pot anymore  says who him  chemotherapy and marijuana go together  like apple pie and chevrolet  maybe  hes addicted to the pot  and he owes his drug dealer a lot of money  you dont get hooked on pot like that  how do you know you didnt even know he had a second cell phone  you have to question this drug dealer person  he may know something  well im telling you were grasping at straws here  then grasp  excuse me maam  hi im looking for jesse he around  no im afraid not   why  im sorry hank schrader  im actually hoping to talk to jesse about my brotherinlaw walter white  he taught your son chemistry in high school  oh mr white yes i remember him  that was a long time ago  yes maam  its my understanding that he and jesse theyve stayed in touch  really  mr white mustve seen some potential in jesse  he really tried to motivate him  he was one of the few teachers who cared  yeah walts that way hes a good man  im so sorry to hear about his illness  please pass along our best wishes  i certainly will as soon as he turns up  hes missing actually  just kind of walked off or  anyway which is why im going around  trying to think of anyone who knows him even slightly  thats terrible  anything we can do to help  well if you could put me in touch with your son  like i said were kind of desperate for leads  jesses not answering either phone number i have for him  and no one seems to be home at his house  and why do you think my son and mr white would be in touch  i dont necessarily i just   are you with the police  no maam not at all  im with the drug enforcement administration  oh my god is my son in trouble  i have absolutely no reason to think that no  do i need to get a lawyer  you know you dont seem very forthright about this  coming here and asking questions about my son  mrs pinkman i swear to you im not here on official capacity  i do not care what your son may or may not have done wrong  i just want to find my brotherinlaw  his wife is worried sick  and shes got a baby on the way  im sorry i would like to help you  but i have not seen my son in over a month  i dont expect to see him anytime soon  well thanks for your time  if you could tell me one more thing  is jesse still driving the uh  89 chevy monte carlo as far as you know  if he had spent half as much time  and money on his education  as he has on that ridiculous bouncing car  lowrider huh  nah nothing yet listen do me a solid and check out a  89 chevy monte carlo  registered to a one jesse pinkman  specifically i want

to know  you were chauffeuring tuco to my doorstep  well at least he wants you alive  hey i dont get it  if tuco didnt kill gonzo then who did  i dont know  i dont know  does it really matter  if he finds out that gonzo is dead and not a police informant  who does he automatically blame  us  we need a plan  think think  lets just bumrush him man  you know you crack him over the head with something  and ill go for his gun  crack him over the head with something  and you got the cbomb man  youre as good as checked out already  you should be like all sacrificial  jumping on a grenade yo
