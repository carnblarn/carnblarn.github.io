hello  im very sorry  thank you  can you tell us anything or any details  right now all we know is two men ambushed hank  they didnt have any id on them probably mexican nationals  their tattoos indicated an affiliation with the drug cartel  why did they attack hank  were not sure yet  it could be in relation to a investigation hank was working  or it could be a message to the dea in general  they had an axe  the cartels tend to be dramatic  jesus   where are they i mean did they  hank got both of them  he killed one outright the other ones upstairs in critical condition  your brotherinlaws one tough son of a bitch to take them both out  considering he didnt even have his gun  he didnt have his gun  why didnt hank have his gun  marie the assault charge  i had to suspend hank pending the investigation  that means i had to take away his weapon  you had to take it   its standard procedure no one  okay all right listen  if you all listened to him from the start and let him arrest that degenerate  he wouldnt have taken things into his own hands  and he wouldve had a gun and couldve defended himself   marie lets just  no just  its their fault  he didnt have a gun  honey this isnt helping you  you  what kind of partner are you  you were supposed to back him up and where were you  where were you  texas  and you  youre supposed to protect your agents  instead of taking their guns  not supporting them not backing them up   marie marie  when they  honey lets just go and sit down okay  im not doing anything until these two get the hell out of here i mean it   sorry  go  you are not welcome here   the dea is not welcome here  okay honey  come on  come on lets go sit down  its not just them  its you walt  this pinkman that hank was looking for  hank would

phone  yo we working sometime this year  what the hell are you thinking why are you calling me here  tried your cell and it went straight to voicemail   how am i to get a hold of you  you arent  its been a whole day how long is this grieving process  just put a clock on it for me  all im saying is we have a schedule right  my family comes before your schedule  dude its not my schedule   we have responsibilities here  ill get there when i get there  you know what whatever ill just cook on my own   you will do no such thing  why not  well for starters  you arent the least bit familiar with any of the equipment  theres gotta be some sort of manual right   and i can read  jesse touch nothing  stop treating me lik e im lik e your assistant  im not your bitch to order around were partners remember  i need you to sit patiently and wait i will be there as soon as i can  thank you very much for your kind words   we really do appreciate that  what is your wife there  yes yes she is  she would be happy to know you asked about her  please do keep us in your thoughts  hey tell your douche bag brotherinlaw  to head towards the light  so im thinking maybe we should go get everybody some breakfast  yeah that sounds good do you know who that was  you know these eggs are really not too bad   look at that  look at what  at what this these spots  this fork is absolutely filthy  tell me you see this youve got good eyes look at that  marie those are just water spots  thats fine  those are not water spots  thats dirt  this silverwares obviously not been cleaned  its covered in germs from someone elses mouth  god knows what  seriously aunt marie its water spots  ours at home arent any better  yours at home are irrelevant were in a hospital  they need to be a higher standard they have a responsibility  well im not actually sure  if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies as being part of the hospital  its in the same building its all under the same roof  do you think that sick people  arent eating with this bacteriainfested silverware  my god how are you supposed to survive this death trap  marie  i survived  i had my lobectomy at this hospital  remember that  remember how scared we all were  i didnt wanna act like it but i was terrified  all that week all i could think of  was how they were actually going to cut me open  and take out a part of me  that was with me my entire life  i couldnt get that image out of my head  i think the scariest part was when they took me into preop  lying there waiting for them to anesthetise you  knowing that you may never wake up again  actually what i really remember about that day  is driving to the hospital  skyler you remember me wanting to drive that day  yeah  anyway there we are were driving up central  and we hit every green light  i mean every single light that we hit green  its just when does that happen  just like bang bang green the entire way  and the whole time all i could think about was  why today why why cant i just spend  a few extra minutes in the car with my family  i never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life  at least i was with my family  i had that  anyway i survived this place  and im not half the man your husband is  yes  what the hell is going on up there  i was gonna ask you the same question  you know about my men  i heard that they attack ed a dea agent why would they do that  whats the matter spanish not good enough anymore  i didnt order this and my men would never do this on their own  someone gave the goahead  are you accusing me  im just saying they wouldnt act on their own  i am not in the habit of picking my own pocket  i assume that the next shipment will be delayed   any thoughts on when it might arrive  a week a month  theres too much focus on the border we lay low for the time being  we lay low and then we get the real story  from my man who survived  your man is in custody  god bless america  hes innocent until proven guilty correct  ill get him the best lawyer  and then well learn the truth  well keep me apprised  any time you got that close proximity to the spine  theres always gonna be cause for concern  but as i say its really too soon to tell  hes out of surgery at least which is   out of surgery on way to recovery  all right and wheres that  unfortunately you cant see him yet  were gonna have to wait for him to stabilize  how long will that take  i cant really say it could be hours  but well let you know just as soon as you can see him  thank you  maybe we should get you home for a couple hours  get some rest  im not going anywhere  me neither  well is anyone else dying to brush their teeth  or is it just me  what if i ran over to the house and picked up a few things  marie i could swing by your place  that would be
