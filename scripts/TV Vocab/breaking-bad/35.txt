                1 previously on amcs breaking bad  i need you all outside to do some wipe outs  wipe down this  i heard you broke new ground today  i walked 16 feet in 20 minutes yeah i guess i broke new ground  you worked here four years its a story people would believe  this is what we buy  slow down oh god  at the first opportunity gus will kill us  so how does it look  you mean in do i see it  yes  do you see it  basically any lawman worth his salts  going to spot that yeah  assuming thats a deal breaker  yes its a deal breaker  well if stealth is what youre aspiring to  you best go with something more compact  38 special  snub nose  got a concealed hammer  so it doesnt catch on your belt when you draw  tried and true no nonsense about it  five shots yep  automatic has how many  ten in the mag one in the chamber  if you cant get it done with five  then youre into spraying prey  in which case i wouldnt count on another six  closing the deal  you load that with 158 grain hollow points  instead of your standard wad cutters  its got plenty of stopping power  cant get more dependable than a wheel gun  here um  try it on with this  that snub youll conceal real nice  if you carry it iwb  little harder to draw from  but theres really no substitute  if youre intent of fooling a vigilant eye  comes in polymer too  i prefer the feel of leather  old school i guess  yeah um  you sure its on the correct side  if youre righthanded it is  i dont know ma are you sure  because maybe itll feel better on the left side  general rule you dont want to cross draw  not unless youre going to be sitting  you know store clerks card gamers and such  either way youre going to want to practice your draw  a lot  because if youre all fingers  well it might could be him  keeping a piece instead of you  catch my drift  whats this  that there is why youre going to pay me  five times what youd pay your neighborhood gun store  serial number has been filed off  so  to state the obvious  i dont want to be caught with this on me  no sir to state the obvious you dont  you know mister ive been providing my services  for the past 30odd years  youd think in that time  id learn better than to ask a man his business  especially about one referred by the lawyer  but i do feel the urge to ask you  we strictly talking defense here  yes absolutely defense  why  because if its just personal protection  aside from a bucket of money  youd save yourself a potential felony twospot  for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number  if youd just buy it legally  yeah but  if you did have to use it  wouldnt it still be better  to use one that couldnt be traced  this is the west boss  new mexicos not a retreat jurisdiction  man steps to you bent on doing bodily harm  youve got every right to plant your feet  and shoot to kill  some call it a moral right  and i do include myself within that class  all this to say  im happy to take your money  but if youre not a convicted felon  you might best be advised  to bear your arms within the confines of the law  its for defense  defense  ill take it   thanks bonnie  jesse  whats up brother  dude it sounds like an earthquake out there

thing or two about scrubbing  any other advice for me  because i am serious about this  good  i am serious too  i have worked 30 years  of building this business from nothing  with my own hands  and my own sweat and blood  i can appreciate that truly  so with that in mind  is there a figure you can quote me  one which you think would adequately  10 million  well lets try 879000  where do you come up with this number  you pull it from your behind  on a typical day  you manage 19 cars per hour  extrapolating i added the extra revenues  for hand waxes and detailing  subtracted your overhead and salary and maintenance  operating fees depreciation  which i obtained from comparable businesses  in the albuquerque area  giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here  to which i applied the industry standard multiplier  and added the market value of your real estate  giving me a total estimated value of 829000  on top of which i generously added an extra 50000  so as not to be insulting  20 million  okay mr wolynetz this  this is the price for walter white  ah oh yes  you dont think i know who you are  i remember  well i have not pretended to be any  your husband he quit without giving me notice  he broke my air fresheners  he cursed at me and grabbed himself  and now he wants to buy my car wash  but hes not man enough  to come in here and face me himself  instead he sends his woman  excuse me  walter white wants to buy my car wash  the price he pays is 20 million  now please leave  have you recently lost a loved one  on an aviation disaster  have you suffered injury
