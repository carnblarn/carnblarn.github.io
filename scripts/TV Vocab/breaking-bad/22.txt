goodman  nice to meet you  youre not that lawyer on latenight television are you  better call saul  i get it all the time  were here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 margo  i get it flatfee clients am i right  well folks todays your lucky day  i represent a client who shall remain nameless  however for our purposes  you might just as well visualise a large bag of money  this individual wants to buy your house today for cash   cash  cash i know in this economy  the money is already burning a hole in my clients account  you can ask mr gardiner ive shown him all the pertinent financials  its the only reason were sitting here  fair enough we get a few papers signed and notarised  we can take care of this right now  in fact i could wire you your money this very afternoon  theres just one little hair in the soup  the price  we feel 875 is very fair  but i suppose theres always a little wiggle room  well why dont you wiggle us on down to 400 and you got yourselves a deal  four hundred thousand what is that a joke  no thats my offer  thats less than halfprice  we put that much into the renovations alone  why dont we just cut the clown act  and you tell us what youre willing to come up to  four hundred thousand thats my final offer   waste of time  ridiculous  how could you possibly imagine wed entertain this   come on hon  i dont know  i thought some allowance was in order once i heard about the meth lab  that used to be in the basement  i looked over your signed disclosure statements  and i dont see any mention of a meth lab nope  oh you got your termite inspection thats good  but no meth lab  now some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony  i myself am more openminded but it is tricky  now dont get me wrong i applaud your cojones  i mean good try  at sneaking a methcontaminated property past a buyer  i mean couldve been a good deal for you too bad  now i could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely  or i could start some criminal proceedings  but i dont think any of us want that now do we  how about it counsellor do you concur  there you go son  come on its not devils island  okay   oh hey  hello   brought pizza  yeah well im making dinner  okay ill just put it in the fridge its even better the next day  hi honey  sorry  skyler  i mean what kind of example do we want to set here right  i mean cant we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together  just hash things out like adults  we have discussed everything we need to discuss  i thought i made myself very clear  i got dipping sticks  youve reached walts temporary number  please leave a message  when i went out this morning to get the newspaper  i saw a pizza on our roof  would you know anything about that  listen to me walt you need to control yourself  calm down accept the situation and k eep your distance  if you cant manage that i will get a restraining order  skyler skyler  got your restraining order right here restrain this
