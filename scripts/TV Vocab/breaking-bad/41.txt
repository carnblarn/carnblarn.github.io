                are we done  no now listen i uh  this attack on my brotherinlaw  i dont i dont know what it means  please  i fear for my family  im sure theyll be fine  i am told the assassin that survived  is gravely injured  its doubtful hell live  now thank me and shake my hand  uh thank you thank you again  youre quite welcome mr white  whats happening  the time   time of death 2043  burn in hell you piece of shit  one suspected gunman died at the scene  the second succumbed to his wounds  earlier this evening at an area hospital  agents with the dea and fbi  in conjunction with apd homicide detectives  are working with mexican law enforcement in an attempt to identify deceased sospect  i can give you highlights  your nephews grew impatient  they continue to press me  for my permission to kill walter white  when i wouldnt give it  they settled instead for dea agent schrader  their phone call was placed to agent schrader  moments before the attack  thus giving him the upper hand  marco was shot in the face and died instantly  leonel lingered for several hours  the warning call to the dea agent  juan bolsa may have some insight  into who placed it  but yesterday the federales were at his hacienda  and in the confusion juan was shot dead  an accident perhaps  a mistake made by his own men  though we may never know  at any rate i thought you should hear from me  this is what comes of blood for blood hector  sangre por sangre  so is this the loud one  what  i can never remember  is this the loud machine with the magnets  no this is the petct scan  positron emission tomography  they pair that with the computed xray tomography  quiet no magnets  right okay  yeah thanks  im still pretty new at this  i mean one minute im starting a new business  my wife and i are thinking about having kids  walk into a doctors office and suddenly boom  life as i know it excuse me  yes im im waiting to hear a progress report  on that thing we discussed  so call me  anyway so for me thats been the biggest wakeup call  letting go giving up control  its like they say  you know man plans and god laughs  that is such bullshit  excuse me  never give up control  live life on your own terms  yeah no i get what youre saying  but but uh cancers cancer so  oh to hell with your cancer  ive been living with cancer for the better part of a year  right from the start its a death sentence  its what they keep telling me  well guess what  every life comes with a death sentence  so every few months i come in here for my regular scan  knowing full well that one of these times  hell maybe even today  im going to hear some bad news  but until then whos in charge  me  thats how i live my life  this residue here is why we descale  with cool water from the walkin  and not water from the tap remember  yeah do it again please  pollos hermanos  where something delicious is always cooking  yes detective  gustavo thanks for coming in  my pleasure hows kathi  much better thank you  and you know hank schrader  ah yes indeed  and steve gomez  how was your meal  agent schrader and i had a chance  to catch up in one of my restaurants a few days ago  id eat there every day  but i wouldnt fit through the door  well should we get started yeah  id like to record this conversation  if thats okay of course  the dea is working on an investigation  which may overlap with my own  so ive asked them to sit in with us today  gus we all appreciate  your coming in here to talk to us  but you have the right to have an attorney present also  oh well i cant see how that would be necessary  but then again i have no idea why im here  so you wish to continue  please im very anxious  to find out what this is all about  sir your fingerprints were found at a crime scene  really  thats surprising  a drugrelated homicide  gale boettichers apartment  so you knew the victim  a chemistry scholarship at unm  i named it after maximino arsiniega  a dear friend of mine who died too young  gale was a recipient of this scholarship  he was uh perhaps one of three dozen  i see  and mr boetticher graduated in   that sounds right  and you kept in regular contact with him  over all this time  oh no i hadnt seen gale for years  until i ran into him a few weeks ago  ran into him where  at the restaurant  uh well ran into isnt quite accurate  as i assume he came by  to reestablish contact with me  we caught up briefly  he invited me to dinner the following night  and i accepted  it was uh perhaps a week later  i read about him in the paper  drug related you said  its a good possibility  the paper made no mention of that  i assumed that it was a random crime  so after years with no contact  he shows up in your restaurant  remakes your acquaintance  and invites you to dinner  yeah he wanted money  gale boetticher asked you for money  he didnt come right out and say that  he spoke in terms  of a vague investment opportunity  but it was my suspicion yes  as to why he invited me into his home  he was a very talented chemist  but for reasons i never understood  he was more interested in taking shortcuts  than what would or could have been  a very promising career  but personal shortcomings notwithstanding  he was a warm gentle person  and i thought a lot of him  at any rate i uh  declined his business offer  and after what was a very pleasant meal left  can you tell us where you were  on the night of wednesday the 23rd  at around 8 pm  not an accusation just a question  oh i understand lets see   ah  i was at a fundraiser at presbyterian hospital  i was there from 7 to about 10  anyone else  uh sorry yeah  just uh just one other thing  uh is gustavo fring your real name  is it my real name  i know youre a chilean national  but there are no records of you ever living there  really  i mean records show  that you immigrated to mexico in 1986  and then a couple of years later  you were granted an entry visa to the united states  but theres no record of gustavo fring  ever having existed in chile  which i find i dont know uh strange  well really it isnt  general pinochets government was guilty  of a great many sins  first and foremost were his human rights abuses  but it was also notoriously unreliable  at keeping records  im sure if you keep digging youll find me  okay i think thats it gus  uh thank you  i hope that i was of some small help  you were absolutely thank you  youre very welcome  good to see you again  oh no no please please thank you  thanks  gentlemen  so are we buying  this thing with his name  what are you thinking there  sure the record keeping in south america  is hit or miss  i mean we run into that all the time right  we usually find something  i mean before 86 this guys a ghost  if the state department wasnt satisfied with his records  they wouldnt have naturalized him  well maybe  but he immigrated from mexico in 89  you know the state just wasnt as tough on background checks  pre911  regardless i dont know what this has to do  with the case at hand  i was definitely curious  when his prints show up at boettichers apartment  but for me the scholarship thing explains it  well ill admit to a certain degree of bias  this man has been a longtime friend of dea  but that being said uh  i thought his story was credible  well i agree i think it was a good story  still why are we hearing it now  what do you mean  well like you said hes a  this mans a big law enforcement booster  one day hes reading a newspaper  and sees that somebody he just had dinner with  somebody he thought a lot of was murdered  he reads this and he doesnt make a phone call  doesnt call you or one of his other cop friends  to share his connection with the case  or ask about the investigation  we cant predicate a criminal investigation  on a person not making phone calls  what do you think tim  well i want to follow up on the scholarship the alibi  but my overall impression i believed him  nice touch bird bath  hey tiger hows it hanging  good  yeah so very nice  whats the damage   i did a lot of researching for this neighborhood  its a pretty good deal  you kidding me thats a great deal  uh speaking of which ahem  thats for the week  plus theres a little extra in there  for any moverelated incidentals  thank you  hey champ hows the new school  good  i loved school when i was your age  seesaws story time  chasing girls with sticks  ha ha ha ha  it wasnt until the fifth grade  that i found out she liked me too  but by then her family had moved to scottsdale  so  carpe diem okay  okay  all right good boy ha  so um youll thank jesse again from both of us  you got it  so is he hows he doing  jesse  hes good  hes uh hes busy  how is it  oh theres space lots of light  its a little garden out back its nice  and brock hows he doing  hey look i dont mind dropping checks off  every week like ed mcmahon  but if you really want to know how theyre doing  why dont you go see for yourself  ill catch you later  hey you going to need a ride home  no  great  anyway im proud for not losing my cool  plus it shows our wipedown crew  that i will support them  if a customer is being really rude to them  youre really taking to this whole be your own boss thing  yeah i guess i am  actually  im thinking about making a move up to management  mmm ah jesus  corporate america look out  oh excuse me  i would be a vast improvement  no one in kleinmans entire front office  knows the first thing about giving an xray  which just ahh  hey dad uh whatever happened with your scan  did did you get the results back  yeah i did  and im still in remission  so youre all going to have to be stuck with me  for a while longer  cheers buddy  what about you hank  how you feeling these days  well im getting there  the other day he had a big powwow  with all the dea muckitymucks  what was that about  nothing just a dead end  he wont tell me either  apparently its all very hushhush  hey walt can you do me a favor  uh maries working tomorrow  and theres this gem and mineral show  thats opening at the fairgrounds  i wondered if you can maybe give me a lift  yeah sure  i had a collection of my own back in high school  i mean nothing fancy  just entrylevel beryls and garnets  one passable black tourmaline  turn right here okay  but i did have one piece of morganite  that was very special  it had been heat treated  so it had that classic cast to it  that rose almost salmon hue you know  hey walt theres no rock show okay  i just said that so marie wouldnt freak  take a right here  freak about what  hank where are we going  you hungry  were not here for the chicken  kill the engine  all right heh heh heh  you ready for your mind to be blown  uh sure  gustavo fring  remember him  he came down to the hospital after the shooting  and put up the reward  he he he sponsors the dea fun run every year  you youve met him  yeah the the fun run guy  yeah that that guy  yeah what about him  well i suspect  and i cant prove it mind you  but i suspect  the mans a drug dealer  hmm  yeah methamphetamine  i mean honest to god i really believe  that this guys maybe one of the biggest movers  in the southwest  remember gale boetticher  the uh that sad sack from the karaoke video tape  yeah  and you said that he didnt strike you  as being the bossman type  that probably there was a much bigger guy  out there right  hank that was  that was just speculation  doesnt matter it made me keep at it  and guess what i find  chicken mans fingerprints at boettichers murder scene  so we bring him in  you think that that gustavo fring  killed gale boetticher  well probably not  i mean these guys use you know  like a dunce to pull the trigger right  but his fingerprints being there  was enough for us to bring him in  so i so you brought him in to the police  right he sits down to talk with us  the problem is that he  what did you ask him what did he say  walt will you let me finish my story here  sorry im just uh interested  you know yeah all right  so we bring him in  and he proceeds to kick our asses okay  hes got an explanation for the fingerprints right  hes got an alibi for gales murder  i mean hes got reasons for everything  this guy is terms of endearment convincing  so hes not guilty  well as far as dea and apd are concerned  hes not officially frings not a suspect  something deep down says hes my guy  just got to prove it  hank why why are you telling me this  i need a favor  what favor  see that volvo station wagon over there  i mean the guy drives a 10yearold volvo  its brilliant anyway listen  what i need for you to do  stick this on it  gps tracker  you know wifey thinks hubbys screwing around on her  but she wants to be sure hmm  you stick this on the car  this part right here its a magnet  and see where he goes  cool huh   unfortunately its not live use  so we got to come back later and you know  take it off and stick it in the computer  still pretty amazing times we live in here  hank isnt that illegal  i mean isnt there some sort of unlawful search and  thats uh known as extralegal  but trust me its our little secret  look its easy okay heres what you do  you untie your shoelace  then you head toward the restaurant  as youre walking past the car  you look down oh hey darn my shoes untied  okay  now when you when you  when you bend down to tie your shoe  you uh you stick this up into the wheel well  then you go inside and i dont know  hank i i dont  i dont feel good about this at all  look walt i i i know  that this sort of thing is outside your comfort zone  no i mean this is a mistake  walt i need you to help me out here okay  i mean this is really important to me  jesus just you make me beg you  come on just stick it in there  yeah  just act normal  may i help you  i i  sir may i help you  look i  i didnt do it  see i didnt do it  do it  do it  may i help you with your order  i uh  what the hell is he  just uh made sure it was secure  uh  wheres my soda  just kidding  lets lets go  look i  i swear to god i thought i was driving the man  to a gem and mineral show  and all of a sudden he has me pulling into your restaurant  and and and telling me that hes investigating you  look you and i weve had our differences  but i would never  look mmy brotherinlaw  evidencewise has nothing  hes hes operating on pure conjecture  and no one not one person that he works with  thinks that you are anyone  other than an owner of a fast food chain  but if something were to happen to hank  then that would only draw their attention to you  and therefore to me as well  so we have a mutual interest  in resolving this without violence  i will make sure that he discovers nothing  jesse  what  all right dont wait to be like invited  are we alone  so where do we stand  where do we stand on what  where do we stand with the thing  the thing that you were supposed to do  i assume you havent done it  you didnt lose it did you  you would tell me if you lost it right  oh jesus  asshole  you creaming to get it done go do it yourself  if he didnt see me coming  like hes some kind of  this all right look  our timetable has advanced  you have got to make this meeting happen  this week tomorrow tonight if possible  oh tonight wow  what are you high  my brotherinlaw  my dea agent brotherinlaw  hes on to gus  huh  did you hear what i just said  my brotherinlaw is on to gus  ah yeah yeah i got it  your brotherinlaw okay im thinking  look uh so what if this is like math or algebra  you add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag  and you get like zero douche bags  ive got some math for you  hank catching gus equals hank catching us  hank geez  hes relentless all right  he wont quit  yeah well hes got nothing  is all i can say  oh and how would you know that  because hes still above ground  you think a dude like gus would let your boy  anywhere near him  hell break out his box cutter on his sorry gimp ass  so you havent even seen him  since that time at the diner  okay shh  think all right  um theyve got to be figuring that weve talked  so you need to tell mike  that you are worried about hanks investigation  okay hank already knows who you are by the way  and besides you actually did kill gale  so theres that  this is all good fodder  for you to request a sitdown with gus  so you can discuss what you would say  in case hank brings you in for questioning  okay now you just  you just say that you want to be  no that that you need  to be able to be properly coached  and when youre near him  you put this to use  hes just going to tell me  to shut my mouth if i get busted  he aint going to set up no meeting  well then insist on it damn it  act panicked  gus ass is on the line  and trust me he will meet with you  if he thinks that youre a liability  no he will waste me if he thinks im a liability  you know what whatever man  im going to take a piss  uh i think you got a phone call  anything important  yes  i did some digging around  and  neither the dea nor the apd  considers you a person of interest  schraders looking into you  totally on his lonesome  a voice in the wilderness  does he have resources  just him his credit card  and his chauffeur walter  from what i hear he would be committing career suicide  if he were to mention you to merkert again  so no warrant  for the tracking device on my car  no the guys gone totally maverick  hes miss daisy with binoculars  we watch our backs  make sure we dont throw him any bones  hell never make a case  what about chile  if i cant find any trace of you before 89  i seriously doubt schrader can  seems to me the bigger problems the cartel  we can handle them if thats all weve got on our plate  but dealing with both schrader  and the mexicans at the same time  if he happens to be watching when they make a move  they could be the perfect storm  thank you  ill be in touch  hello hector  the cartel has given me its ultimatum  to which ive said no  dea agent schrader  uh hes a concern  hes looking into my past  is today the day hector  si  look at me hector  look at me  maybe next time
