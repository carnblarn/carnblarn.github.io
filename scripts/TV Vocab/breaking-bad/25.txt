yeah  i was just wondering how you feel about that   i turned it down end of story  good good  jesus god knows im relieved  i needed some time here because im deep into this investigation  and couldnt do both  so i made a judgement call  you know that you can talk to me about things right  you dont have to go through this alone  do you ask me which lead bib to put on someone  before you nuke them  jesus marie  i made a decision im not going through anything  doing my job   i would like  i know i know  a condo in georgetown i know  if you would let me finish i was going to say  id like to be included thats all  dont you worry about my career my career is just fine  did you not wanna go  i dont blame you i just   arent you late for work or something  after what happened  it would make perfect sense for you to not wanna go back  im onto some important stuff right here right now  and mexico doesnt have a damn thing to do with it anyone who doubts that  i mean im doing some actual good out here  and all i get are these bullshit accusations  what everyone thinks im jerking off on this thing fine  but im onto something i know it  you understand me  you hear me  what exactly is this  ill tell you what i think it is  a ploy a ploy to get me cooking again  and an obvious one at that  how do you mean  as if i would seriously believe you would hire an addict  jesse pinkman recovering or not  you vouched for him previously i took you at your word  no no no no let me be clear let me be perfectly clear  jesse was capable of working under my supervision  trusting him with a solo venture  well thats quite another matter  how he could possibly produce anything  other than a mediocre product at best  i am told his product was more or less consistent  with the quality i had come to expect  more or less  more or less really  boy that is the talk about setting the bar low  except you dont do that set the bar low  therefore what conclusion am i left to draw  that you believe i have some proprietary kind of selfishness  about my own formula  some sort of overweening pride i suppose  that you think simply overwhelms me  clouds my judgement   but it doesnt  absolutely not  i simply respect the chemistry  the chemistry must be respected  i apologise for being so transparent  would you take a drive with me id like to show you something  hi is everything okay  shes already finished an entire bottle but she still seemed hungry  then she fell asleep  but i was thinking id give her another when she wakes up  yeah yeah absolutely absolutely   fatten that baby up  will do  was that it  so where are you are you at work  yeah yeah im at work i shouldnt be much longer   is that okay  you know i love my little pookums  you can leave her with me for the next 18 years  as far as im concerned  great thanks marie  are you sure youre okay  sweetie what is it come on   its hank  hank what about him  i dont know how to talk to him  i dont know what to say

paso said they want him back  yeah  hes not going steve gomez is going in his place  and i dont know how i feel about that  well hes certainly a lot safer up here isnt he  of course and i want him safe  but i cant tell what he wants he wont talk to me  he hardly even comes home he works all day all night  barely eats barely speaks to me  its lik e somethings eating him away from inside  hes

bed  look at the size of this reaction vessel  oh its got its gotta be 1200 litres  where where  how did you know how to put this all together  i had excellent help as will you  quite a lot of planning went into this  i would say so  the laundry upstairs ive owned it for years  it receives large chemical deliveries on a weekly basis  detergents and such  there is nothing suspicious about it  and my employees to be sure are welltrained trustworthy  the filtration system is state of the art  it will vent nothing but clean odourless steam  just as the laundry does  and through the very same stacks  i need 200 pounds per week to make this economically viable  you would choose your own hours of course  come and go as you please  so long as the quota is met  sorry  the answer is still no  i have made a series of very bad decisions  and i cannot make another one  why did you make these decisions  for the good of my family  then they werent bad decisions  what does a man do walter  a man provides for his family  this cost me my family  when you have children you always have family  they will always be your priority your responsibility  and a man a man provides  and he does it even when hes not appreciated  or respected  or even loved  he simply bears up and he does it  because hes a man  any chance we could grab a quick bite  thai place around the corners pretty good  i really gotta head home  all right rain check then  she said it was the tofu  whatever shes still cute anyways  great dinner mom  can i be excused  to do homework or to play video games  i can multitask  yeah

right one more rv  dmv said the registration wasnt renewed  but then they realised it was never filed as nonoperational or destroyed  no police report either  i just dont know what the hell im doing anymore you know  its like im paralyzed  like if i take a step in any direction  im gonna make a spectacular mistake  god i could go for a glass of wine about now  you wanna go to  sorry never mind  anyway  breaking news is i am sleeping with my boss  and i dont know why  yep  thats a lie i do know why  i mean hes a lovely guy  hes a really good person  but i mean its not like were ever gonna  somehow and i cant actually believe it  but my entire family sees me as some sort of  my own sister my brotherinlaw  my teenage son  tells me im a bitch  and you say tell him the truth  tell him about his father  but i cant  ever  how could i  and this man that im seeing you know  as wrong as i know it is  as much as i know im probably doing it to make walt leave me  it is the only thing in my day where i dont feel  like im  drowning  so he knows about this other man  yeah  so then hell sign  walt says hes not going anywhere  so thats a really brilliant gambit on my part yep  genius  he keeps money in the house  your husband the drug dealer  how much money  i didnt count it its heavy  a bag where he keeps it  are you asking my permission to spend this money  no god no i just  no im just you know  im just trying to just talk it through thats  let me just say that im half as qualified  and twice the price of a therapist there is nothing to discuss here  im just saying you know we have a history  hes the father of my children  and maybe what he did he  he did it for the family right  well guess what  that is one enormous load of horse shit  okay  im going to spell this out as simply as i can for you  you are a fool to stay in that house one minute longer  if your husband wont leave then you go  you are now an accessory after the fact  you are culpable  you your children you could lose everything you own  do you understand  all courtesy of this criminal you refuse to divorce   i didnt marry a criminal  well youre married to one now  hows about we run through this one more time  especially where i do the talking you dont say jack  oh im gonna say jack im gonna say plenty  what did we say about escalating huh whos got your back here  me all right im going to take care of things  hey what are the parameters of this sobriety thing you got going   what do you mean  can you take a xanax  because i got a drawer full of them  i get them from my chiropractor  vietnamese

you  please have a seat here  mr pinkman if you will  youre late  gentlemen if we could come to some accommodation here now  theres always a way to oil everyones lock  this young man is prepared to offer you a sweetheart of a deal  for doing precisely nothing  really  ten percent of all future profits from his solo venture  thats money you get paid for walking down to the mailbox  consider it a gesture of respect for your valuable contribution  to the business thus far im sure youll agree thats fair  thats charity is what that is  i do all the work  he sits around on his fat ass judging people  escalating stop  so theres that but then theres one small detail  clearly a mistake was made on the part of our mutual associate  when he paid you half of jesses earnings  he must not have realised that you two had come to a parting of the ways  take it it belongs to you  youre damn right it belongs to me  i knew i could count on you boys to play nice thats   that almost brings a tear to my eye  enjoy it  spend it in good health  that is the last money youll ever earn in this business  what the hell is that supposed to mean  well i hate to break it to you jesse but our mutual associate  was only using you to get to me  what are you talking about  see he needs someone with expertise  someone who knows what hes doing  in other words he needs me  youre telling me youre cooking again  yeah lets see how should i put this  im in  youre out  walt hold on there  what was the offer if i may ask  its three million for three months of my time  youre gonna need that money laundered i mean of course  what was our deal before  seventeen percent thats a shade high  lets settle on an even 15 thats a nice round number  five percent   fourteens fair  five   thirteen  five   twelve for old times sake 12  five  im a reasonable guy its a shortterm deal  ten even but i cant go any lower and still respect myself  five  what in the hell just happened youre my lawyer not his  thats the way of the world kid go with the winner  you think this will stop me from cooking  cook whatever you like  as long as its that ridiculous chilli p or some other dreck  but dont even think about using my formula  just try and stop me bitch   yes  hi there mrs ortega   yes  hi im hank schrader  im with the drug enforcement administration  were interested in an rv thats registered to your

the dmv  i just didnt get around to it  may i ask why  i mean its a great way to get the family together  for an affordable vacation  it mustve been a blow when it went missing  it was  do you have any ideas at all who mightve taken it  i didnt want him arrested  he ran with a bad crowd but he was never a bad person  i thought he could turn his life around  who are we talking about mrs ortega
