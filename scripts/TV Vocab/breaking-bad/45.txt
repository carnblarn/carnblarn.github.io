anonymous threat against me  im stuck in a wheelchair im not even on the job  no someone doesnt like the way ive been spending my free time  what minerals  timing seem a bit odd to you huh  i mean i start looking into you know  fring and all of a sudden im under lockdown for my own protection  wait a minute whoa whoa whoa what  gus fring  from the chicken restaurant  hank what are you talking about  just one mans humble opinion  thats all  but i think los pollos hermanos  is a front for the biggest meth distributor  in the southwest   oh my god  steve   oh my god are you are you even looking into this  were looking into everything  but we work on fact not conjecture  and the fact is  that the scumbags that hit you first  were mexican cartel  not some german multinational whatever  and definitely not colonel sanders  now if we even had a shred of proof  isnt that what you get paid to go get  remember that laundry i told you about  id start there  come on man  its a perfect spot for a meth superlab  oh my god  hey  what if im right  even if you were right  and you aint  but if you were theres no way in hell  a judge is going to give me a search warrant  search warrant  what happened to good oldfashioned knock and talk  oh thats right i forgot  you were never very good at those were you   can i help you  yes sir  my friend and i we wondered if we could take a look around  why   sorry whats your name  dennis  dennis hey im steve gomez  im with the dea drug enforcement  what is there there a problem  not for you no no problem  were just wondering if we could take a look around  i uh  can i tell you a story   yeah  i bust this chef  well he says hes a chef  but just because you work at a restaurant  that charges 14 for a burger  that dont make you a chef  that makes you a glorified burger flipper  at least in my book   yeah  anyway  so we bust this chef heroin possession  he says well just because you found heroin  in my chef whites doesnt make it mine  maybe it came from the place  that launders my chef whites this place  oh come on man i dont want to do this stuff with you  ii know i know  you dont have to say it ill say it for you  his story is a big load of steaming horse shit  i mean were going to find heroin here  like were going to find jimmy hoffa right  the thing is is that the chefs daddy  is a united states senator  im not going to tell you which one  but you probably know who he is right  so now ive got to waste my time  checking out this burger flippers story  and if i dont his old mans going to jam me up  my asac my whole entire office  politics huh  so what do you think  listen you know what  i have to check with my boss and hes out of town  and i cant promise ill reach him anytime soon either you know  well yeah thats probably the way to go  so ill have to go get a warrant  and well do it official  but youre probably going to have to close down for the day  what why  twenty agents poking around  come on itll be less trouble  if it was just us two  but your call  just the two of you  youll make it quick right  dennis well be like the wind  ookay   could you tell him  okay  okay  oh and dennis can you clear
