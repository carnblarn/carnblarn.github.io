i very much regret involving you in this  this was  this entire thing was  unfortunate  unfortunate  and i apologize deeply  now please tell me why you did it  thats not really at issue here  you told me your insurance was covering it was that a lie  if you wont take our money  and your insurance isnt covering it how are you paying for it  this is not an issue that concerns you gretchen okay  excuse me it does concern me it concerns me greatly  you tell your wife and son  that i am paying for your cancer treatment  why are you doing this  i will clear this up with them  the look on skylers face shes sitting there tears in her eyes  thanking me for saving your life why would you do that to her  as i said i will clear this up  just please  allow me to do this in my own way in my own time  all right  i will explain the whole thing to them  and while youre at it explain it to me  i dont owe you an explanation  i owe you an apology and i have apologized  i am very sorry gretchen  there ive apologized twice now  im humbly sorry  three times  let me just get this straight  elliott and i offer to pay for your treatment no strings attached  an offer which still stands by the way  and you turn us down out of pride  whatever and then you tell your wife  that in fact we are paying for your treatment  without our knowledge against our will you involve us in your lie  and you sit here and tell me that that is none of my business  thats pretty much the size of it  what happened to you  really walt  what happened  because this isnt you  what would you know about me  what would your presumption  about me be exactly  that i should go begging for your charity  and you waving your checkbook around  like some magic wand  is going to make me forget how you  and elliott cut me out  what that cant be how you see it  it was my hard work my research and you and elliott make millions off it  that cannot be how you see it   good thats beautifully done  you left  you are always the picture of innocence   you left me  the picture of innocence   just sweetness and light  you left me  newport 4th of july weekend  you and my father and my brothers and i go up to our room  and youre packing your bags barely talking  what did i dream all that  thats your excuse  to build your little empire on my work  how can you say that to me you walked away  you abandoned us me elliott  little rich girl just adding to your millions  i dont even know what to say to you  i dont even know where to begin  i feel so  sorry for you walt  fuck you  little man  you hungry  what are you doing  spooge i got him i got him  baby get up and help me  call me a bad mother ill show you a bad mother bitch  get up damn it get our dope  bedtime  here we go  whos the big tough guy now is that you  youre the big man try and hit me now bitch  try and hit me now try and hit me now bitch  should i ask where youve been  never mind  were long past that i suppose  gretchen called about an hour ago  we need to talk  just say it  theyre cutting off the money  what did she say exactly  not much it was  abrupt she said  something like  im sorry  to have to do this but elliott and i  can no longer continue to pay for walts treatment  i wish you the very best  and that was it  she sounded apologetic  i guess it was quick she got right off the phone  i was so stunned but  i called her back and she didnt pick up  so  what do you know about this  she and i had a perfectly nice visit this afternoon  and then you come home and all of a sudden shes in a big hurry to leave  and then the two of you are talking in the driveway  what do you know that i dont  where were you tonight  i drove up to santa fe  i was with gretchen  well gretchen and elliott  she just couldnt bring herself to tell you today  i mean she couldnt tell me either really  there was a lot of  hemming and hawing and beating around the bush from both of them  what tell us what  there was a lot of  business phraseology being tossed around  things like  cash poor and leveraged  and quarterly decline yada yada yada  but what they were truly saying in my opinion  theyre broke  you are kidding me  i mean the economys in the toilet we all know that  and all these big banks and  fannie mae and  apparently  gray matter is no more immune  than anyone else  that is  jesus thats  she could have just  told me herself  well theyre prideful people  listen  not to sound selfish  but as far as we go  well get through this okay  theyve already paid for most of my treatment  right  were going to make it  all right i promise  and yet  she still drives a bentley  keeping up appearances or i dont know who knows  baby that dont make any sense  of course it makes sense every safes got its weak spot right  say youre designing a safe where are you going to put your weak spot  nowhere  i made it like  strong  jesus on the bottom thats where  you put your weak spot on the bottom  baby that h is  bringing me down   you took too much i told you  i need  i need to even out let me get a hit of that crystal  hell no youve lost your share  come on baby  its all i need is just a little hit  shut the hell up you dumb skank im
