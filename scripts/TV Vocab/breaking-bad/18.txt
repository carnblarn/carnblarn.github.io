                previously on breaking bad  its an entire city full of buyers now why arent we exploiting that  its not our territory  theyre not gonna do a thing about it  your tumor has shrunk by 80   whats this  im in recovery  you know pot is like stepping stones  how do you want to proceed  sell off what we have  then i guess im done  nothings really changed  we sell when we want where we want  this is our city  were gonna be kings  whats up  what you need  yo you buyin or are you just stopping to envy  punk bitches  please leave your message for 5051275223  record your message after the tone to send a numeric page  bounce little man skinny im up on 2nd and hazeltine  getting eyeballed hard  i got a bad feeling man i need some backup  get your ass up here now   whats that thing in your ear  what did i say get out of here  what are you waiting for go     weve made such headway with your treatments  that now its time we talked about sealing the deal  absolutely  as you know  my initial diagnosis was that your cancer was inoperable  that may no longer be the case  we think now that a lobectomy may be a viable option  maybe a pretty good option  dr bravenec is one of the few surgeons in the country  performing lobectomies after fulldosage radiation  hes got a good track record  pretty good  it sounds  aggressive  yes very much so  understand that if you dont have this surgery  youre just waiting for the cancer to spread  and it will  now through the treatment youve had already weve bought you some time  maybe a lot probably a little  but thats all  in my opinion  if youre willing to take some risk  then this offers the best chance  how much would it cost  im not on your insurance  id say between 170000  and 200000 all in  for my part id be willing to write off what i can  but mine isnt even the biggest expense  this is obviously a big decision  and you folks are gonna want to take some time to discuss it  ill do it  dont you think we should at least talk this through first  i just think its the way to go  i have to say i think  its the right choice  i recommend that we let the pneumonitis heal for another couple of weeks  and then well have at it  thats tricky   whens the due date  its the 21st  so two weeks and change  ill book the surgery for four weeks from now  that way walter can be on his feet for the birth of your daughter  but i wouldnt wait any longer   god  its me  where the hell were you i called like 20 times  working  what is it  combos dead  shot  which one is he  you did not just say that to me   jesse listen  that figures

meeting with  is very careful  a cautious man  i believe were alike in that way  if you are  who i think you are  you should give me another chance  i dont think were alike at all mr white  you are not a cautious man at all  your partner was late and he was high  yes he was  hes high often isnt he  you have poor judgment  i cant work with someone with poor judgment  are you familiar with my product  ive been told its excellent  it is impeccable  it is the purest  most chemicallysound product on the market anywhere  that is not the only factor  you could charge twice  the current rate for what i provide and your customers would pay it  hands down  now who i choose to do business with on my end  is not your problem  you wont see him  you wont interact with him  forget he exists  i have to ask  why  why him  because he does what i say  because i can trust him  how much product do you have on hand   ready to go at a moments notice  will i hear from you  i have your numbers  you can never trust a drug addict  look i mean its all kind of little dribs and drabs  but right here take keller for instance  a couple hundred dollars here a few thousand there  dribs and drabs  once you add it all up though and with keller  the revenues are almost 10 less than was actually received  and this is every quarter for the last two years  when i saw that i got worried so i checked accounts receivable  on other customers i found six other instances  of revenues being underreported  and ive only just started to look into it  we have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies  they anticipate their needs for the next quarter  most of the time they overestimate  so i just let them roll their overages into the next order  and if i dont theyll go elsewhere  obviously we forgot  or didnt go back and adjust the revenue entries  i know its wrong from an accounting standpoint but as you can see  the moneys coming in ventually as you can see  right  right but  i got the old bills of sale and order forms out of storage  to try and sort this out  and most of the time theres no backup for the reported revenues at all  in a few cases  i found xeroxed copies with the dates changed  all right  you got me  were talking nearly a million dollars of undocumented revenue   what are you thinking  im thinking  about saving a company  im thinking about peoples jobs  about their mortgages and pensions  and their college funds for their kids  not to mention my own  it doesnt mean that you have to break the law  yes it does  its right there in the books business is terrible  the bank is on my back the irs is grinding me down to a nub  if i dont keep up  people go to prison for this  my dad built this company from nothing  we make things here  the people who work here are like family  i cant let that all fall apart because of a couple of bad years  dont report this  please  im not gonna turn you in  but i cant be a part of it  i know  i know i just wish  im sorry  i dont want you to go  yo if i know you leave a message  yo its skinny pete just checking in with you man  we missed you at the funeral today  the whole crew was representing even badger came all the way from fresno  combos people his ma grandma cousins  everyone was all choked up and shit  man it was like emotional  and you should have seen the coffin  it was like this shiny white pearlescent
