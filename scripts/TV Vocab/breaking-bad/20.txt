happens  shit  there he is  were doing a feature on walter junior  we called you about 50 times  i thought we were just talking about a newspaper story  i know but i thought  if its good enough for the journal then why not tv  so i went for it  this is him  this is dad great  lets get everyone on the couch im thinking walt junior in the middle  mom and dad on either side  mom and dad  how much money have you raised so far  6360  but theres more coming in all the time   thats amazing  we dont even know what to say  its been incredible  judging from the things you and other folks have written about him  your dad must be quite a guy  he is hes the best  you dont want to lose him do you walter  none of us do  we love him   hes a good man isnt he  absolutely ask anyone  anybody hes a great father a great teacher  he knows like everything there is to know about chemistry  hes patient with you and hes always there for you  hes just  decent  and he always does the right thing  thats how he teaches me to be  would you say hes your hero  yes maam  totally my dad is my hero  does that put him to sleep  this one just relaxes him a little  were almost ready well be taking you in in just a minute  here we are  relaxed yet  as a matter of fact  i dont know what this stuff is  but its pretty great  yeah it looks like it  well be here when you wake up  ill be looking for you  theyll probably want me to take your glasses  you better  wheres your phone  your cellphone did you bring it  which one  im pretty sure he didnt bring it mom  first things first  how old is the baby now and when do i finally get to meet her  i was actually thinking of bringing her today but  shes seven weeks tomorrow  seven right  i have a  a picture  here somewhere  shes beautiful  always a relief to say that and actually mean it  hows your pain level walter  very low basically  shortness of breath  a bit but much better  good  your margins look good  obviously i cant foresee the future  but even conservatively speaking i can say that  you bought yourself some real time here  theres no reason not to be optimistic  thats great  that is great  so when could he get back to his normal routine  he can ease into it now  and can he go back to work or  id give it a few more weeks  make sure you avoid any heavy lifting and continue to get plenty of rest  but he can be on his own  just more independent  use your best judgment  thats good news for you honey  one less baby in the house  welcome back  thanks its good to be back  jesus  we were all so sorry to hear  terrible thing just  but you know weve all been thinking about you and   youve been doing okay  im doing okay  after a certain point  time off doesnt help  so i figured id rather be here  focus on work  sure  absolutely  see you inside  truth or consequences altimeter  pima 311 contact albuquerque center 1346  juliet 5 bravo ident say altitude  juliet 5 bravo roger cleared direct to winslow  i think i may just keep this  what do you think  doesnt look so bad right  what are you doing  im going to hank and maries for the weekend   since when  im taking the baby with me  marie will pick up walter junior from school  youll have the house to yourself for two days  i want you to pack your things and leave  why would i do that  hank has offered to help since you shouldnt be doing any heavy lifting  i want you gone by monday morning i want  i want you gone  can you at least tell me why  because youre a liar walt  two cell phones after all  what  right before your surgery i asked if you had packed your cell phone  and you said  which one  when  i was medicated  i could have said the world was flat  you know what i think  i think you accidentally told the truth  honey we have been over this  asked and answered right  then it got me thinking  again about all the strange behavior  not the least of which was the disappearance  out of my mind with worry calling hospitals  checking the morgue  your fugue state  i had to believe that didnt i  i had to find a way  i mean  who would lie about such a thing  you tell me  you tell me exactly what it is you think im lying about  what im having an affair   is that what you think  yes   for the last few weeks  with whom  who am i having an affair with  my guess was gretchen schwartz  something was going on between you  i just knew  jesus  get me a bible to swear on if thats what it takes  i am not having an affair with gretchen  i know i know youre not  because i asked her  it really took me forever to get in touch with her  she was ducking my calls for weeks  so i finally left a message  what exactly is going on between you and my husband  i thought that would get her attention and it did  so she called me back and she finally told me  the money for your treatment  gretchen and elliott didnt give you a dime  they paid for nothing  you refused every offer they made you but that didnt make sense  because i checked with delcavoli at the hospital and  not including your surgery  were nearly paid up  over 100000  out of where  out of thin air  but then  i called your mother  thanks for that too  but i thought maybe she has some money that i dont  know about maybe she contributed  its possible  it turns out that not only is the money not from your mother  she didnt even know that you have cancer  you never went to see her  i dropped you at the airport i picked you up  you were gone for four days and  yet she swears  that you were never there  lies on top of lies on top of lies  could you  just once  do me the courtesy  of not denying it  dont do this please  please dont go  if i tell you the truth  will you stay  stay and i will tell you everything  whatever it is  im afraid to know  wayfare 515 radio check  wayfare 515 albuquerque
