that like its some sort of  dirty word  this is insane  i have so much cash onhand  that i actually count it by weighing it on my bathroom scale  and yet i cant spend it i cant tell my family about it  all of whom think that i am right on the edge of bankruptcy  its insane  well i guess thats why gangsters had molls  what  gun molls  havent you ever seen white heat  ive seen white heat but i dont see how that pertains  maybe you need a moll more than you need a wife  who you cant trust with your secrets  what good is money that doesnt spend if a tree falls in the forest  you get the point  so

have to spell it out for you  no i know  youre thinking that i should be funneling my money  into my sons website but absolutely not no  i am not going to have my family think that some  mystery benefactor saved us  not some mystery benefactor singular  that would raise too many questions however stay with me here  zombies  i got a guy who knows this guy who knows this rain mantype  he lives
