a fiction writers seminar at unm  and you know probably talking about how to get published  and that sort of thing  you know so anyway i thought maybe you might  i mean ill go with you if you like  and i was thinking about what you asked me the other night  you know you were wondering if i had a second cell phone  and well ive been thinking about that a lot  and i think what you heard  was my cell phone alarm going off  ive been using it a lot as a medication reminder to  well remind me to take my medication  and the weird thing is that  the alarm sound is almost exactly the same  as the regular phone ring  which is really a poor design if you ask me  but i think that was probably it  i tried to go in  and change it to a different sound  other than the phone ring but  they so overcomplicate these things  anyway  it was probably just as well that i lost it  theres got to be a new one on the market by now  you know if we do this thing at unm  maybe on the way home  we can stop by and i can get a new cell phone  ready  yo for what might help  not another intervention  jesse bruce pinkman  pursuant to section 47813  of the new mexico real property code  you are hereby

this  not talking to me  going out all day and refusing to tell me where  you are obviously angry with me about something  so lets talk about it  god  i feel like youre upset with me  because you think that  im up to something   like what  i have no idea skyler  what that im having an affair is that it is that what you think  is that why you asked me about the  some other phone because you think that im being unfaithful  i dont know  so ask me  why   would you even tell me  yes i would  of course i would  and no  im not im not having an affair okay  now what do i do to prove that to you
