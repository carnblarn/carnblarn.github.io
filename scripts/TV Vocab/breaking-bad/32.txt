                hey guys  so if its okay i was thinking about using this one for the test  moms brakes are very sticky  and you barely press down on them and its like a screech  sure  but im good  yeah youre great why  are my feet okay  i looked it up new mexico says all i need is a note from a doctor  i know its not the right way and all  but once i get my provisional i can keep working at it  well as long as it gets you safely from point a to point b  then who am i to argue  hi  youre a sweet girl yes you are yes you are  i know   here you go  here you go   all right  thank you   got it  yeah  okay all right   so 9 am saturday  yes 9 am saturday  so which means pick me up about 830   ill be here with bells on  what  its just a saying dont worry i wont be wearing bells   hey  hey mom   hi do you have a minute  yeah   could you keep an eye on your sister  sure   thanks  see you dad   bye son hey good work today  thank you  have you thought anymore about what we discussed  thought anymore meaning reconsidered no  so show me the flaw in it  flaws skyler flaws plural not singular  where do you want me to start  hey i dont love this situation all right that you put me in  however lets just stick with what makes sense here  you took the money you won gambling  invested it in the car wash you helped run  you hired your wife as a bookkeeper because shes actually a bookkeeper  that is a story an auditor can believe what am i missing  you should just take this money that i give you  and not look too closely at it  so if god forbid i get caught  you maintain plausible deniability  okay my estranged husband who when he was working  made 43000 a year starts shovelling money at me  and when the police come im supposed to say  i never thought about it officers made sense to me really  that in your mind is plausible deniability  i tell you what walt  id rather have them think im bonnie whatshername  than some complete idiot  so youre promoting caution here  and you want a believable story  that it seems to me is the safest way  to make the best out of a very bad situation yes  but im noting a little hole in your plot though  why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you  because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation  though it may be hopeless and futile  then again hed try anything  im just not buying it no i think it would be better  if the husband were no longer estranged  yeah maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed  and suddenly a fantasy story  i am at least gonna be a part of this household  dinner with the family every night of the week  not every night no  six nights a week one night off  dinner two nights not weekends  with 24hours notice  five nights a week with no notice  three sixhours notice   five nights a week two hours notice  four  dont push it   and i want my own key to the house  no  for emergencies and appearances yes  i am going to babysit my own daughter help my son with his homework  i am going to be a part of this family that is how well sell your little fiction  how about we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer  no thanks though maybe some other time  seriously  get a beer with me  what  what the hell are you doing  thats ours right  look at it and tell me if thats ours  yes its ours now put it away  what the hell is wrong with you  where did you get that did you take it from the lab  i bought it from the two guys who killed combo  they had combo shot down in the street  and now its our product theyre selling  which means they work for our guy right  what no what is that thats hearsay do you have any proof  i heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him  hear how i just said kid  this kid hes 11 years old  shot combo on orders  these two scumbags they got him dealing  they got him  and you know hes not the first  they use kids because hey why not easy to control easy to fool  all they get is juvie if they get caught  hearts and minds right  get them young and theyre yours forever  these guys killed combo  they used this little kid like some puppet  they used him to shoot my friend  so why are you telling me this  i need your help  how   i need ricin  oh my god   oh my god  look these two   hey  no  hey they gotta go all right i got the entire thing figured out   no  the delivery method everything  all i need from you is the poison thats all   no  look   otherwise you dont gotta lift a finger  no  you dont know what youre talking about   not even  look you dont get how right this is  you dont get how the whole entire world would be better off  were not talking about this  i know a woman who buys from these two once or twice a week  they sit in their car all day and they get hungry so she brings them food  and they knock a few bucks off her price  theres your delivery system right there   i could be a mile away  jesus  a methhead youre trusting to do this  know what that methhead stood up to your brotherinlaw  he questioned her for five hours she didnt give it up  know how you know because youre not in prison right now  well i know i would be in prison after this  prison or worse and id be right alongside you  no jesse you cannot be serious  this is a ridiculous idea  its ridiculous what so youre saying its not gonna work  how about back when it was your plan when we were gonna use it on tuco   apples and oranges  guy eats ricin  two or three days later he gets the flu or a heart attack and he keels over  thats what you said untraceable back to us  to me  not even that other scumbag we work for is ever gonna figure it out  it was a good plan back when it was tuco and its a good plan now  tuco wanted to murder us these guys dont  apples and oranges do i really have to sit here and explain the difference  combo was us man  he was one of us does that mean nothing  why didnt you go after these guys two or three months ago  because i just found out about them  whats to find out  its a dispute over turf right  i mean how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf  and kill them months ago  because back then you were too busy getting high feeling sorry  now murder is not part of your 12step programme  this is not some amends that you have to make  what you are talking about here is pointless  this achieves nothing  it accomplishes nothing  if you dont see what it accomplishes  then theres no way i can explain it to you  jesse listen to me  you are not a murderer  im not and youre not  its as simple as that  jesse  im doing it  with or without you  knock knock  chrissakes marie you dont say knock knock you like that   i like saying it  well thats not the rules   okay  you knock your way ill knock mine  but look see i win  not so fast  christ again thats three in a row  got a fricking paul newman over here   been playing cards with your dad  no why  how is your old man  back teaching  no i dont think either of them are working  right now  how they swinging that   i dont know  hey  did you know the doctors told your uncle hank  he can get out of here anytime he wants  oh yeah thats great   yeah im not so sure about that  why not  what thats what they said  because they want the room  they hit the sheets with lysol reset the meter  and wheel the next slob in we went over this marie drop it  are you not well enough  jesus kid you too do i look well enough  im shitting in pans peeing in pitchers  i cant move my legs got it  so people in wheelchairs should be in hospitals  what about people on crutches maybe i should be in here too   is that what youre trying to say  exactly deal you little prick  bitch  you know im hourly right  he promised me that he would be here  oh he promised  why didnt you tell me lets wait then thats a joke the kid aint coming   okay so whats plan b  i dont know   i really dont  well lets brainstorm   you really think hes serious  thats why im here saul  the way he was talking he is going to do it or try at least  okay so we pay him off  no no its not about money its about getting him off the streets  getting him to calm down  maybe  what if we maybe  could you get him arrested  you want your criminal associate taken into police custody  no now listen i know it sounds risky  but it wouldnt anything that would get him into real trouble  and nothing that could lead back to our business  just some minor offence  pinkman in jail i dont know im picturing it and  no not jail as in jail jail  im talking about one of those situations  where youre in an orange jumpsuit picking up litter along the highway  thats jail  youre talking about a leveltwo joint  something that keeps him off the street for 30 days  then by the time he gets out  tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on  well roswell correctionals pretty low impact you know  in the past ive recommended springer  but im hearing chancy things about their bathrooms since they renovated  so  so its possible right  well it falls under my premium services package  but you can afford that ill call my pi  you understand what you have to do  and you can never talk to anyone right  i mean ever understand  yeah  i found this stuff on the internet  takes days to kick in  just keep quiet and this wont ever come back to you  you okay with this right  just think of it like its the same thing as always  youre just delivering some hamburgers  its not just delivering hamburgers  hey you got a kid right   whats his name  patrick  all right imagine these two guys had patrick working as a mule  making him kill people  wouldnt you do anything to protect your kid  of course i would i do all kinds of things for him  okay so  these guys are using kids like that  they gotta go right  good  tomorrow  ill be in touch  yeah i bet that tastes good huh  hey  come here baby  okay here we go  here we go  what are you doing if you need to talk use the phone  this isnt a phone talk walter  your wifes out right  isnt she something  i got a granddaughter a few years older  what can i do for you  have a seat walter  i spoke to goodman about pinkman and this plan of yours   and  well im not gonna do it   why  because its moronic  saul said youve done things like this before   thats not the moronic part  okay so whats the problem  the problem is the boss wouldnt like it  saul  my boss  your boss  this is a professional courtesy no one knows im here understand  but our employer would find out like always  and if pinkman were arrested hed take it as a problem  walt  you got a good thing going here we all do  you wanna risk it all on one junkie  now i realise you two have a history  but this kids been on the bubble a while now its a long time coming  what is  i used to be a beat cop a long time ago  id get called on domestic disputes all the time  hundreds probably over the years  but there was this one guy this one piece of shit that i will never forget  gordie he looked like bo svenson you remember him   walking tall you dont remember  no  anyway big boy 270 280  but his wife or whatever she was his lady  was real small like a bird  wrists like little branches  anyway my partner and id get called out there every weekend  and one of us would pull her aside and say  come on tonights the night we press charges  this wasnt one of those deep down he loves me setups  we got a lot of those but not this this girl was scared  she wasnt gonna cross him no way no how  nothing we could do but pass her to the emts put him a car  drive him downtown throw him in a drunk tank  he sleeps it off next morning out he goes  back home  but one night  my partners out sick and its just me  the call comes in and its the usual crap  broke her nose in the shower kind of thing  so i cuff him put him in the car and away we go  only that night  were driving into town  and this sideways asshole is in my back seat humming danny boy  and it just rubbed me wrong  so instead of left i go right out into nowhere  and i kneel him down and i put my revolver in his mouth  and i told him this is it this is how it ends  and hes crying going to the bathroom all over himself  swearing to god hes gonna leave her alone  screaming much as you can with a gun in your mouth  and i told him to be quiet  that i needed to think about what i was gonna do here  and of course he got quiet  goes still and real quiet  like a dog waiting for dinner scraps  then we just stood there for a while  me acting like im thinking things over  and prince charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants  and after a few minutes i took the gun out of his mouth  and i say so help me if you ever touch her again  i will such and such and such and blah blah blah  it was just a warning  of course  just trying to do the right thing  but two weeks later he killed her  of course  caved her head in with the base of a waring blender  we got there there was so much blood you could taste the metal  moral of the story is  i chose a half measure  when i should have gone all the way  ill never make that mistake again  no more half measures walter  man i dont get this  i dont get this at all all im seeing is the kid  so where are they  i dont know theyre always around  burgers are getting cold  so is it like fast  dont sweat it youre just doing what you do  hey nobodys gonna know anything   can i have another bump  look you had your bump  get this thing done then you can have all you want  gonna need you to come with me  take a walk  where we going  sit down  i understand that you have a problem with two of my employees  it is true that they killed one of your associates  it is possible they acted rashly  but on the other hand there was provocation  the man was selling on their territory  there is blame on both sides  this will go no further  it will be settled right here right now  you told him  wait outside  listen to me you have one friend in this room this man  those men outside are my trusted employees  and when i learned what you intended to do  if it wasnt for this man and the respect i have for him  i would be dealing with this in a very different way  you dont look at him you look at me  this is what happens now my men will come back inside  and you will shake their hands and you will make peace  and that will be the end of this  no  jesse   pardon me  they use kids  these assholes got an 11 yearold kid doing their killing for them  youre supposed to be some kind of a reasonable businessman  this how you do business  you okay with this you got anything to say here  bring them back  no more children
