up a little restaurant division  into an industry leader  and a source of great personal pride  i am shocked and saddened by his death  and outraged by the damage his actions have brought upon my grandfathers company  alleged actions  an innocent man does not kill himself  my people and i are here to help  through your investigation i pledge madrigals  full cooperation and transparency  i confess i have my selfish reasons  i believe peter schuler was a lone anomaly  but if that is not the case  i want to know it  just as you do  so when you gonna announce it  i dont know   as im

itself  bullshit it does  sir  whats with that apd thing the electromagnets  theyre thinking its about frings laptop  turns out a couple of days before it happened  desk sergeant gets this phone call from a postal inspector  quote unquote  wanting to know where they keep the thing  and he told them jesus  anything left of the laptop  do we look that lucky  you know i sneaked a peek before apd took it out of frings office  the whole thing was encrypted  they wouldnt have got anything anyway but  so hector salamanca killed fring  but who gave salamanca the bomb  whole lot of questions  and not much in the way of answers  yet  the apd did find some of frings financials  that just might lead to something  i had him out to my house  fourth of july  we cooked out in the backyard  my son shucked the corn  my daughter cut up potatoes  fring brought sea bass  every time i grill it now  i make a little foil pouch just like he showed me  that whole night we were laughing  telling stories drinking wine  and hes somebody else completely  right in front of me  right under my nose  hi what can i get you   just tea please chamomile  oh sorry we dont have chamomile tea  then some sort of bergamot provided its not earl grey  i like soy milk instead of dairy  we dont have soy milk or any sort of bergamot  wow youre really running me through my paces here  uhhuh  well english breakfast i guess

there you go  breathe in breathe out  drink your whatever  who killed gus  havent i told you not to worry about that  now what do you want from me and why is it so important  whats this  a list of 11 names  okay  you know them all  i do  those 11 men and i think you know this mike  those 11 could sink us you and me both  where are we going with this lydia  no specific im just pointing out facts  these men your men yours and guss  these men were on the payroll very publicly  they trace back to pollos and the laundry  they trace back to madrigal and theyre gonna get picked up by the police  and when they do when they get picked up and threatened with prosecution  and theres only one way out for them theyre gonna  and im not saying all of them okay  all its gonna take is two or three or even one  but theres always a weak link somewhere  but theyre gonna talk at least one of thems gonna talk about you  about me and thats all its gonna take  these are the 11 i know of but id love your input  i never met your chemist for instance  id love your input  you want me to kill every man on that list  wow thats a leap  what you just uh  no i didnt say that  but if you think thatd be wise  youre scared arent you  yeah  youre very upset  which im gonna factor into my response here  these are my guys and they are solid   understand  what about chow at the warehouse  didnt one time you have to shoot him through the hand  you think that didnt stick in his memory  what about dennis at the laundry  theyre sure to pick him up  they already have they picked him up last night  my guys are solid  i vetted them with great care  and fring made sure they were well compensated  in the event of a situation such as this  theyre paid to stand up to the heat  keep their mouths shut no matter what  and they will  now i dont know what kind of movies youve been watching  but here in the real world we dont kill 11 people  as some kind of prophylactic measure  look at me  and say you understand  i understand  i get it  so were off that very silly idea  good  drink your hot water   i gotta go  have you had enough  yeah im good  okay  byebye   bye  bye  bye big brother  say bye to mom for me  i will have a good day  you too   skyler  mmm  hey  the car wash opens in 15 minutes  mariano can open for me today  hey how about you get up huh  come on  a shower will feel good  hey chow  how you holding up  okay  you know they they  they talked to me  you cant smoke in here chow  thanks for coming down  have a seat mr ehrmantraut  am i is that right  close enough  so once more youre waiving your right to have an attorney present  correct  could you state that to the camera please  im waiving my right to have an attorney present  uh okay then we just have a few questions  youre currently employed by the pollos hermanos chain   is that correct  yes i am   and what do you do there  corporate security   corporate security  yeah  whats that like uh guarding the special sauce  i conduct employee background checks  i oversee loss prevention  at a fastfood restaurant thats a fulltime job  we have 14 locations so yes its a fulltime job  yeah well  if i were you id start sending out those resumes  it says here youre a private investigator  where you licensed  new mexico arizona utah  every state where we operate  colorado  you have some restaurants there right  colorado doesnt require licensure  you licensed to carry a firearm  concealed carry yes i am  which states  itd be quicker to mention the states in which im not  and if we pulled your ccps  everything would be in order  im guessing youve already done that so you tell me  you strike me as a former cop  am i right  where at  philadelphia  philly  the city of brotherly love  it turns out we uh we know some folks there  and they told us that your tenure as a police officer  ended somewhat uh dramatically  you wanna talk about that  not particularly  yeah me neither  see im more interested in why gus fring  decided to put a guy like you  in charge of his corporate security  i mean given your history  doing background checks on pimplefaced fry cooks  seems like over  what else you do for fring  he mustve needed help running that drug empire  of his no  drug empire  first im hearing about that i dont know anything about that  hey man we have a guy that could put you in that underground lab  and hell testify to it  so from here on out this can go hard or easy  so whats it gonna be  forget your handcuffs  im confused  am i under arrest here or am i not  you wanna state that for the camera  you are not under arrest currently  agents do you have any more questions for me  because youve got me very stirred up  with all these false accusations  if im not under arrest id prefer to leave  uhuh  and i suppose we could talk about the two million dollars  in your granddaughters name  yeah it seems uh  fring had all these secret offshore accounts  that he would deposit money into  like uh well an even dozen of them  and theyre all in the names  of certain people on his payroll  there was the uh the manager of the laundry  um a couple guys from the pollos distribution center  there was the owner of a chemical warehouse a bunch of others  you know guys that mustve been getting paid off the books  anyway one of the names was kaylee ehrmantraut  ten years old  and just cute as a button  yeah two million and change  we found on deposit for her  way more than anybody else  now my partner here  he took one look at that and said shit man  this fifthgrade girl is the muscle behind frings entire operation  i said whoa whoa hey partner slow down there  maybe it was actually  her dear old granddaddy  impressive no  but  level of insight  hes not impressed gomie  perhaps hes picturing all that money going byebye  yeah well i mean  the governments gonna take every last dollar unless  well heres the thing mike or michael   mr ehrmantraut  heres the thing mike  lucky for you you didnt touch that money  i cannot say the same for the other 11 on the list  one of your guys is gonna roll on you  and then well definitely remember the handcuffs  now before that day comes  you can do yourself a solid  you can tell us what you know  you can tell us whos still out there  and if we like your story  good things can happen  kaylee might be able to keep some of that money  maybe  so what do you say  i dont know anything about any money  i dont know what youre talking about  first order of business  is to find a new place to cook  before anyone says it no more rvs  i dont know the crystal ship did pretty good for us  the crystal ship   yeah thats what i called it  well ill admit it held us on as a starter lab  but it was too dark too small  not to mention it couldve broken down  at any moment  saul find us someplace safe from prying eyes  security against detection is paramount  but i dont wanna drive too far  no more 50mile treks to some indian reservation  in town is trickier  i mean you got a lot more of your prying eyes  if gus can manage it then so can we  precursor where are we with that  uh were good on everything  except uh methylamine  no surprise  its just dry as hell out there  what if we switched back to a pseudo cook  absolutely out of the question  jesse there is methylamine out there i know it  yeah but what if theres not  because there isnt i mean really  there is  have faith  can i can i offer a thought  uh  say a guy wins the lottery  ten million bucks  the very next day whats the one thing he does not do  he does not go buy another lottery ticket right  he counts his lucky stars and he sails off into the sunset  which seems to me and all due respect  some advice you two might take  what lottery did i win exactly  hey youre alive  i mean as far as im concerned thats the irish sweepstakes  im alive and im broke  counting the money that i owe jesse  im about 40 grand in the hole  does that seem like an acceptable  stopping point to you  there
