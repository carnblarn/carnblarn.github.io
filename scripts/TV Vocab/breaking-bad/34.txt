                last season on amcs breaking bad  youre a drug dealer  im a manufacturer im not a dealer  grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives   youre my new lab assistant  gale boetticher  theyre assassins i believe i was their prime target  they were steered away from me to my brother in law   its tens of thousands of dollars  we have the money   you are not in this  how i am not in this  i was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself  it comes down to you and me versus him  im sorry but its gonna be him  they got me in the laundry and theyre going to kill me  do it  just what the hell was that  you might wanna hold off  why  because your boss is gonna need me  hows it coming  very very well  its a flurry of deliveries  feels like christmas morning  ah its exciting  its really coming together  and i would like to point out  that if you have any very understandable questions  about the price tag  that sound quality  at pfizer at merck  that unit would be right at home  that goes for all of it  good  i want you to have what you need  oh well i doff my proverbial cap to you sir  when do you think well be up and running  within a month id say  two weeks  yeah two weeks  good very good  by the way  that sample you asked me to run  i ran it and it is quite good  thank you very much gale  you can give that to victor to discard  sure  is that our competition  im sorry  the  it really is quite good  the purity of course im speaking of  speaking strictly in chemical terms  and i cant as of yet account for the blue color  but if that is our competition  we have our work cut out for us  so to speak  you dont have any competition gale  not as far as im concerned  after all how pure can pure be  well it can be pretty darn pure  mr fring i can guarantee you  a purity of 96 im proud of that figure  its a hardearned figure 96  however this other product is 99  maybe even a touch beyond that  id need an instrument called a gas chromatograph  to say for sure but  that last 3 it may not sound like a lot  but it is  its tremendous  its a tremendous gulf  gale for our purposes  96 will do just fine  please dont let this trouble you  yeah its just  id love to know who synthesized it  is all  a man who wants to work with me  a trained chemist like yourself  but it wont happen  i dont consider him a professional  if hes not i dont know what that makes me  im not trying to talk myself out of a job  with this person there are other considerations  his is the best ive ever seen hands down  and i look at this place that youve

didnt deserve what happened to him  he didnt deserve it at all  but id shoot him again tomorrow  and the next day and the day after that  when you make it gale versus me  or gale versus jesse  gale loses simple as that  this is on you gus  not me not jesse  gales death is on you  i mean really what did you expect me to do  just simply roll over  and allow you to murder us  that i wouldnt take measures  extreme measures to defend myself  wrong  think again  and whatever  whatever it is youre planning there  whatever whatever it is  the point that youre trying to make here  let me let me suggest that you keep one thing in mind  without us  without jesse and myself  you have no one to make your product  certainly not him  this this person doesnt know  what the hell hes doing  been watching him for weeks  i know every step of his cook  do you really you  really so please tell me  catalytic hydrogenation  is it protic or aprotic because i forget  and if our reduction is not stereospecific  then how can our product be enantiomerically pure  i mean is 1 phenyl 1 hydroxyl  2 methylaminopropane  containing of course chiral centers  at carbons number 1 and 2 on the propane chain  then reduction to methamphetamine  eliminates which chiral center is it again  because i forgot  come on help me out professor  gus  were here come on  let us work  all his bullshit aside its called a cook  see everything comes down to following a recipe  simple complicated it doesnt matter  the steps never change  and i know every step  oh is is that what you want  this this short order cook  youre not flipping hamburgers here pal  what happens when you get a bad barrel of precursor  or how would you even know it  and what happens in the summer  when when when the humidity rises  and your product goes cloudy  how would you guard against that  gus  you do this  all youll have left  is an 8 million hole in the ground  this lab  this equipment is useless without us  without without jesse and myself  you have no new product  you you you have no income  your people out there will not be paid  your distribution chain collapses  without us  you have nothing  you kill me you have nothing  you kill jesse you dont have me  you wont do this  youre too smart  you cant afford to do this  please  let us just go back to work  were here  let us work were were  were ready to go to work  well just pick up right where we left off  oh my god  well  get back to work  lets just well just lay this down  well put him in feet first  grab his shoe  oh here wait wait just life him up  there all right  here we go  god  if you push that way ill hold him in  okay ready   oh shit  all right wait wait  forget that  come on  up  get down  okay  i never used this stuff you sure itll do the job  trust us  here you go hon get you anything else  no im good thanks  god  how are you doing  no i mean you know  how are you doing  you did the only thing that you could  i hope you understand that  thoughts  got any thoughts  on what our next move might be  what next move  our next move  our next move  given the fact that at the first opportunity  gus will kill us  what that wasnt an opportunity just now  seemed like a pretty damn good opportunity to me   no no  golden i would say  we bought ourselves some time   uhuh  yes but  the question is how much  hell be looking for another chemist  hes not going to find another chemist  hmm  where is he going to find another chemist  its not just about somebody  being able to run a lab that big  someone he can trust  someone he knows will keep their mouths shut  yeah good luck with that  bet it took him years to find gale  bet hes sorry now  are you sure youre okay  at least now we all understand each other  right  what do you mean  i mean
