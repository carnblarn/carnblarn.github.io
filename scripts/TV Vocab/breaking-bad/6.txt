                lets get something straight  this the chemistry is my realm  i am in charge of the cooking  out there on the street you deal with that  as far as our customers go i dont wanna know anything about them  i dont want to see them i dont want to hear from them  i want no interaction with them whatsoever  this operation is you and me and im the silent partner  you got any issues with that  whatever man  no matter what happens  no more bloodshed  no violence walt   you all right  oh yeah  yeah im okay  you know honey you really dont have to  look i like being here with you  im only saying that  id be okay with it really if you want to go  you know actually  it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there  when walter jr gets home from school  okay  all right   youll call me when youre finished  oh yeah  and have you been in touch with elliott  because i havent seen a check from him  yes i got it   really  it came yeah  yeah it came last week  and i put it right into my credit union account so  taken care of it  good  so were good were good  could you not deposit this  until monday  thank you  call if the discomforts too much  otherwise well see you next week  yeah  chemical reactions involve change on two levels  matter and energy  when a reaction is gradual  the change in energy is slight  i mean you dont even notice the reaction is happening  for example  when rust collects on the underside of a car  but if a reaction happens quickly  otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way  that generates enormous bursts of energy  who can give me an example  of rapid chemical reaction  hint hint right here  like an explosion  yes good  explosions  explosions are the result  of chemical reactions  happening almost instantaneously  and the faster reactants i e explosives  and fulminative mercury is a prime example of that  the faster they undergo change  the more violent the explosion  so explosions  okay listen why dont you start reading on your own  from the top of chapter 7 all right  you okay  i got it mr white  dont worry  you got kids to teach  thanks hugo  hes starting to lose weight  which is tough  to see that  you know to feel the difference when i put my  arms around him   can i talk to him  of course  walt  when you dont let me in when you dont tell me whats going on  i think its like i feel like you dont even want me around sometimes  no  and recently these afternoons  when youre coming home so late  and were just left wondering  where you are  yeah dad  whats up with that  walt is there anything else  youre holding back from your family  nows the time to share  well  i like to be alone i mean at times  and its not about you really  its just that sometimes it feels better  not to talk at all  about anything to anyone  alone time can be helpful for some types  maybe knowing what you do when youre alone  might make it easier for your family  to be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone  well  i like to go on walks  a couple of times a week maybe more after work  and i really enjoy the nature  you know the cacti  the vegetation that kind of thing  its really very therapeutic  yo you okay   did you breathe that shit  no im just dizzy  come here   sit down sit down  im burning up  take this off  sit down get some air  oh god  yeah thats better  when were you going to tell me  tell you what  cancer  you got it right  how did you know  my aunt had one of those dots on her  to target the radiation  what is it in your lung  im your partner man you should have told me  thats not cool okay not at all  what stage are you   gone to your lymph nodes  your aunt  how bad was she when they caught it  bad enough she didnt last long  how long  seven months  i get it now  thats why youre doing all this  you want to make some cash for your people before you check out   you got a problem with that  you tell me  youre the one that looks like you just crawled out of a microwave  you going to be able to finish the batch  yes  all right  no  you do it  me  yeah  what happened to your mad skills  go on here  you do it  you can do it  if you have any questions ill be right out here  the next time put an ice pack on your head during chemo  my aunt said it helped with the hair loss  whats this christmas  this the one we found way out in the boonies the cook site   holy shit  what  lab pulled up an imprint of some old writing  that used to be on the inside old magic marker or something  yeah whats it say  property of jp wynne chemistry lab  thats walts school  we were supposed to start at 3  im out there making fat stacks man chill  hey prepaid cell phone use it   how much is this  26 big ones  is that all 26000  no thats 26 hundred  and your share is 13  minus 25 bucks for that phone   how much meth did you sell  nearly an ounce  last time i checked there were 16 ounces to a pound  you smoked the rest  ive been out there all night slinging crystal  you think its cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time  why are you selling it in such small quanties  why dont you just sell the whole pound at once  to who what do i look like scarface  this is unacceptable  i am breaking the law here  this return is too little for the risk  i thought youd be ready for another pound today  you may know a lot about chemistry  but you dont know jack about slinging dope  well ill tell you i know a lack of motivation when i see it  youve got to be more imaginative you know  just think outside the box here  we have to move our product in bulk wholesale now  how do we do that   what do you mean to a distributor  yes yes  thats what we need we need a distributor now  do you know anyone like that  yeah i mean i used to until you killed him  so who took krazy8s place  some guy named tuco  a bad ass from what i hear  tuco okay so then just go talk to tuco  right like  hello sir hey i know you dont know me  but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine  well yes but maybe with a little more salesmanship perhaps  you just dont get it man this guys og  what does that mean  jesus look hes upper level man  hes not going to do business with some dude he doesnt know  you dont understand the way it works  you cant just bum rush some highlevel ice man  and start cutting deals okay  its risky you need an intro  you need someone to vouch  well who introduced you to krazy8  emilio thats only because i knew him from like third grade   we cant talk to emilio either  all right all right  look im telling you mr white its too risky  okay i mean were making money  why cant you just be satisfied with the way it is  jesus  just grow some fucking balls  wait till monday again  yes please thank you  mr white  thank you hugo   knockknock  oh
