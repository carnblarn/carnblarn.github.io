should you  its just a matter of time  mike  where is the laptop  what the hell difference does it make  they got it end of story  apd northwest area command on 2nd  they tagged it they filed it  its in the system  and they locked it in their evidence room  all right  all right so describe the building  describe the  how about i describe fort knox  and what are you going to do  are you going to put on your black leotard and go dangling on a close line  its a building full of cops what else do you need to know  and why in the hell am i talking to you  mike we gotta do something  i am doing something  hes good with this stuff just give him a chance  now you look  that laptop might as well be on the moon  they build these evidence rooms  like bank vaults because guess what  lunatics like you want to break into them  but unlike a bank vault this is a place that is guarded 24 hours a day  by the police  theres no way youre getting it out of there  who said that we have to get it out of there  we just need to destroy whats on it  oh so now you want to blow up a police station  i dont believe i said that no  nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite  now you want to kill a bunch of cops  ive never said anything about killing anybody  i am however considering the possibility of a device   a device  yes a small device  say this device gets filed into evidence  now it is inside that room  what about a magnet  you want to commit a whole other crime  just to get this bomb of yours into evidence  who said bomb i said a device   yo what about like a magnet  an incendiary device  one quick fire is all it would take  you dont think they have fire suppression  im not talking about sprinklers  im talking about halon because halon doesnt destroy evidence   a magnet though maybe like  all right so a bomb then  maybe we plant a bomb outside  oh actually i knew a crew out of fort worth  that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside  about all they did was take out a couple of hedges  you are probably talking about 2 feet  of reinforced concrete  or what about a magnet  what magnet what about it  you know just a  so what do you think  expensive  leaving aside engineering  rigging some kind of alternate power source  my primary sticking point is i actually need the thing  as you gentlemen can see  its paying the bills  but i mean its feasible doable  hey were living in a time  of uh string theories and god particles  feasible doable yeah sure why not  expensive  what would you put it in  what about that does it run  we can get it running  whats the box made of  plywood and aluminum just what you need  all right so you want to talk money  step into my office  hey listen um  i dont actually have any money right now  my wife theres an irs issue
