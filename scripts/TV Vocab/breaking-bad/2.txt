and the topic was senior class photos  and how we had instituted a new rule last year  that seniors are allowed to  have photos taken by a photographer of their choice  not necessarily the photographer that the school hires right so  anyway some of the senior girls  were going to that  glamour shots place to have their photos taken  and now theyre bringing us all these photos  and joan epperman you know joan  suddenly has to go through all these photos  and turn them down because they show cleavage  did you get enough pancakes sweetie  yeah im good  you know even these smallbusted girls have cleavage  apparently theres some new type of brassiere  or something  the wonderbra  its the wonderbra  hey there youve reached walt skyler and walter junior  we cant come to the phone right now so please leave us a message  hello mr white this is att calling  are you happy with your current long distance service  cause if youre not i would definitely really  love to talk to you as soon as possible about  hello hello this is walter white speaking  you said he was practically dead okay  you said he would die any minute  listen i am having breakfast with my family right now  and i really dont appreciate these sales calls  well too bad man cause guess what  hes still not dead  i went and put my ear to the rv i can hear him like  rolling around in there all right  i think hes awake man i think hes trying to get loose  where the hell are you im freaking out over here   calm down damn it  are you gonna help me clean this up   we got loose ends here  calm down  i will be there after school  after school are you shitting me  ditch it man call in sick  listen that is just not going to work for me  im not interested in that at all  and i would appreciate if you dont call here anymore  damn theyre so annoying those people   you have a good day sweetie  okay mom you too  bye honey   drive safe  okay  yo yo yo 1483369  representing the abq  what up biatch  leave it at the tone  so the term chiral  derives from the greek word hand  the concept here being that just as your left hand  and your right hand are mirror images of one another right  identical and yet opposite  well so too organic compounds can exist as  mirror image forms  of one another all the way down at the molecular level  but although they may look the same  they dont always behave the same  for instance  im sorry for instance  thalidomide  the righthanded isomer of the drug thalidomide  is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman  to prevent morning sickness but  make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman  the lefthanded isomer of the drug thalidomide  and her child will be born with  horrible birth defects  which is precisely what happened in the 1950s  so chiral chirality  mirrored images right  active inactive  good bad  yes ben  is this gonna be on the murder  what  is this gonna be on the midterm  the chirality on the midterm no no well maybe  maybe yes you know but prepare  for it to be on the midterm  cant hurt to know it right  knowledge is power  oh no no  not good not good  what the  hey you  listen no no no no  oh god  milfs  what the hell is a milf  now what  the other one out in the rv hes   youre sure  yes  positive   feel free to go check it yourself  yes good idea  maybe i should do that before he too wanders off on the damn street   okay you know what i  all right all right  the one downstairs tell me about him  come on anything something   start with his name at least  krazy8  krazy8 what the hell does that even mean  i dont know man okay i mean hes like  krazy8 okay i dont know  so you work with him regularly  no not him so much   his cousin mainly  whos his cousin   the guy out in the rv  all right all right  krazy8s one level higher  one level higher  yeah you know not like street level  higher  you know theres like a starbucks at every corner  krazy8 is like the dude that sells starbucks his beans  okay so hes a distributor  okay so is he  i mean is he in other words  what is his reputation for violence  well um  he did try to kill us both yesterday so theres that  what im trying to say is that hes a distributor right  hes a hes a businessman hes a man of business  it would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting  out of mutual selfinterest yes  what  do you think he is capable  of listening to reason  what kind of reason  like dear krazy8 listen  if i let you go will you promise not to come back and waste my family  no colombian neckties you mean that kind of reason  no man i cant say as i have high hopes where thats concerned  what was that  what was what  come see  we gotta tie him up  why the hell didnt we tie him up  because he was out cold  but what if hes faking it  like if it was me id be all faking being knocked out yo  and then when the coast is clear  id be up looking for weapons and shit  waiting to pounce  now if it was me and i couldnt find a decent enough weapon  i would just lie back down and bide my time  so now what do we do  you keep asking me that  like you think i have some answer   well you gotta do something  we  we have got to do something and i am opened to suggestions  man uhuh okay this whole thing was your deal  dont you dare put that on me  you brought those guys out there this is your responsability  like i came to you begging to cook meth  nerdiest old dude i know you wanna come cook crystal please  id ask my diaperwearing granny but her wheelchair wouldnt fit in the rv  what about the the phosphate gas  phosphine gas what about it  i mean do you think it still might kill him  you know with like a delayed reaction or something  i dont know   youre supposed to be a scientist  look  this isnt even the issue that demands immediate attention  we have got a body in that rv  and its getting warmer outside understand  and we have got to do something about that soon  and in a way that no one will ever find it  now that last part  is very very important  therefore  it seems to me that our best course of action  would be chemical disincorporation  dissolving in strong acid  oh man thats messed up  youre not youre not serious  youre serious  whos gonna do that  and dont look at me  i guess well both do it together  no mr white okay im not good with dead bodies  were in this 5050 okay  i guess the only other fair way  to go about this would be  that one of us deals with the  body situation while the other one of us  deals with the krazy8 situation  in a scenario like this  i dont suppose it is bad form to just  flip a coin   heads or tails  ill do the body in the acid okay  heads or tails  heads  best two out of three  yo yo yo 1483369  representing the abq  what up biatch  leave it at the tone  mr white its me pick up  i got a container question  hello mr white pick up the phone man  yes  what kind of plastic man  polyethylene  how the hell am i supposed to know that  because i told you  look just  look at the bottom for a triangle  stamped ldpe  it should be molded right into the plastic  yeah yeah ldpe right on got it  but i dont know man this feels kind of flimsy  any decent acids gonna eat right through this   not hydrofluoric  why not  look you skipped  clowned around or otherwise jerked off  to every lecture i ever gave  as far as im concerned your chemistry education is over  oh okay be a dick about it  so hey have you  have you done the thing  yeah im working up to it  you know what i bet he doesnt even wake up  not even if you took him to the hospital right now  now if it was me i would just try and think of it like i was  i was doing him a favor  whos there  dont you fucking play games with me whos there  yeah i see you  what are you gonna do  i need water  bring me some water would you  please  you dont like the crust  wheres my cousin emilio  he dead  hey mr white  mr white  are you smoking weed  oh my god  wait a minute is that my weed  what the hell man  make yourself at home why dont you  so what did you end up buying  nothing  no store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body  i dont suppose you could buy two bins  legs in one torso in the other  god  i dont suppose you could kiss my ass  how did it go  so you didnt do it  not yet  god   i gotta go  what no come back here  sorry ill do it tomorrow i promise  tomorrow  ive got a doctors appointement i gotta go  look stay away from him  hes awake  hey man we flipped a coin  we flipped a coin  were good  were very good  were excellent id say  oh would you look at that face  smile

god  im sorry what were you asking me  oh yes  that stupid plastic container i asked you to buy  you see hydrofluoric acid wont eat through plastic  it will however dissolve metal rock  glass ceramic  so theres that
