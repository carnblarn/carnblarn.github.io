                1 previously on amcs breaking bad  they found a notebook  i made a copy for you in case youre interested  it pertains to some methamphetamine superlab  money  what are we saying is the source of this money  walt came up with a story about gambling winnings  blackjack right some card counting  actually that was skylers idea  i think you are behind all this  when the others find out what youve done  maybe we come pay you a visit  ndale mueve el culo cabrn  ya voy ya voy  ndale brelo  did you want me to open the doors  qu ests haciendo eh  here the keys  take them  por qu me ests hablando en ingls  why you talk english huh  qu  no no no no no  ohh  ahh   gambling destroyed my life  me my family everything i loved  it was like a robbery only i was the thief  its amazing the stories you tell yourself  to justify it  the lies that lead you to just one more hand  one more spin  one more roll of the dice  this is our deal okay  marie no  you guys are not lifting a finger i mean it  yeah were bringing everything so  this this is not up for debate okay  great  now sweetie dont worry okay  were not going to say one word about the bills  we just want to bring everyone up to speed okay  all right ill see you soon  bye  so  tonights the night  no turning back  well  okay  lets do this  okay so first i assign point values  correlate to the effect of removal  you going to split the 8s  skyler please  now the mathematical principle  known as the kelly criterion  upon which i devised my own strategy  not dissimilar to the mit system  walt youre not teaching them  i thought you wanted me to be thorough  just play youre taking too long  what you dont think it behooves me  to be able to explain any of this  it behooves you to be a pro thats all im saying  thats the fiction so chopchop  dont chopchop me  walt  now we both know that the first decision  is whether or not to split or surrender on 8s  split em mmhmm  good on both  next decision is whether to double down or not  what you should be doing  on 11 yes double  okay this hand over here  we have a soft 18  the final decision is whether or not  is to hit or to stand  hit it  becomes a hard 15  dealer has a 9  i see that  hit it  oh  okay lets see what i got  and 21  damn yep  okay this  the key thing to remember here  is that its not about any one hand  the key is the number of hands per hour  ooh  lets go again  zero minus 1  okay  walt  its not as if i dont know how to play  i certainly more than understand  how to count cards  lets just keep going okay  no you know what im in recovery  remember  i shouldnt even be playing  and that is the fiction  that we should be sticking to  you know what  youre right  yeah   wow  okay  um were not leaving anything to chance  all right lets get started  ive got a lot of uh  walt  weve got a lot of ground to cover  what is this  we have to get our stories straight  weve got to be on the same page  is this a script  bullet points  bullet points  like a novella  this is smart  you really want to try to sell a dea agent  some illprepared  halfassed fullofholes story  about how we suddenly have enough money  to buy a car wash  am i supposed to memorize this  we need to practice walt yeah  we need to be wordperfect  within reason  we need this story to be solid  and sympathetic  and most of all completely believable  from a story that you already told marie  and you think that she hasnt told hank  ha come on this is marie were talking about here  no she hasnt  she hasnt  hank thinks his insurance is paying for everything  maries not telling him  that were paying his therapy bills  and neither are we  and why is that again  really  if we have the gambling story  did you take money walt  you remember gretchen and elliot  because i seem to recall  that youd rather sell drugs than take help  fine  marie will tell hank in her own time  and at least well have laid the groundwork  and coming clean with hank and jun  appearing to come clean  will be the best thing for everyone  we talked about this okay  we agreed about this  yes we did its just  what  never mind just  okay  so i really think  we should tag team the narrative okay  well each be responsible  for certain portions of the story  and then we can uh we can hand off  so we dont leave anything out  and itll seem the most natural  okay so im going to launch  with the exciting news  that we are buying a car wash  yay  the next logical question  hank will probably ask  is where are you getting the money  hmm to which ill say  we want to tell you the whole story  its a doozy  so hold on to your hats  do you like that  sure  it accomplishes two things  it keeps it light  while letting them know to expect something big  uhhuh  yeah no its a doozy  hmm  okay  anyway thats where you will take over  starting with your diagnosis pages 1 and 2  okay and its its pretty much  going to run parallel to the truth  which makes it easier  but um  just make sure to really hit the cancer  really touch on the fear and despair  its good to remind them  and to get their sympathy right off the bat  we want them to understand  why you could do something so stupid  now after that  per pages 3 and 4  after you say  gambling became an addiction  and i just couldnt control it  do you see that yes  right there in the middle of the page okay  oh and i put in that line about robbery  you know from the ga meeting  i thought that was good  so next ill chime in  about how it affected our marriage  uh starting with the  uh the deceit  why we couldnt tell anyone  terribly terribly ashamed of my actions  yeah  theres two terriblys  its supposed to show contrition  well i just wouldnt use that word  i would never say the word terribly  phrase it however you want okay  youre jumping ahead now  and why why am i so ashamed  do i really need to answer that  i was and am providing for our family  lets just pick up where we left off  im weak and im out of control  i mean this whole thing makes me look like crap  this has to be a wartsandall story walt  thats how well sell it and we both look bad  oh well how do you look bad exactly  where is the i slept with my boss bullet point  i cant seem to find that anywhere  for a fired schoolteacher who cooks crystal meth  id say youre coming out pretty much ahead  i dont like it  i dont want junior thinking less of me  at least you won at gambling  im just the bitch mom  who wouldnt cut you any slack  im sorry  im sorry that i put you through all of this  hows that sound hmm  here  two sorrys  i believe we were on page 5  so after you say how very sorry you are  in your own words of course  were almost to the end  and i say how proud i am of you  for joining a 12step program  and and this is where i think we should enact  how were feeling you know  just a just a suggestion  you might look down on the floor with remorse  hmm  what you dont have to mean it  you just stare down at your feet walt okay  then uh im gonna  i was thinking of taking maries hand  and saying something emotional  like its such a relief to tell you  were just so glad we have a strong family  to help us through this  that we can all support each other  and then maybe ill tear up a little  i dont know  ill just have to see what happens in the moment  youre going to cry on cue  i said i dont know maybe  when you dab your eyes you going to do it  with your right hand or your left  its just an idea one tear two tears  this has to be convincing  especially to hank  im doing the best i can here walt  and yes im thorough  maybe lying doesnt come as easily to me  as it does to you  hey guys come on in  hi good to see you  hey put her there you little punk  hi hey  great to see you hank  hey buddy how you doing  oh look at my little princess  shes getting big huh  an heavy too  whoa is that actual food im smelling  i might get an honesttogod meal here for once  you look good  thank you sweetheart  your

minutes  you have a rock collection  its a mineral collection  uh just a little something i  you guys want to see it want to see it  sure lets go see it  oh hey let me  hey its all right i got it  come on guys its down the hall here  now that one there thats rhodonite okay  its manganese inosilicate  cool  what what makes it be all pink like that  well thats the manganese part okay  it it oxidizes you know like rust  exactly manganese can have an oxidation state  of between 3 and 7  which takes it through a range of colors  purple green blue  but its most stable state is 2  which is usually pale pink  so  exactly whatever the hell he said  anyway you uh you get the idea  yeah its uh interesting  interesting stuff that  really  oh hey uh  here give me that file will you  you got

about  you know walt if you  you can always bend my ear right  i mean if you ever need to talk or  or just blow off some steam  im im here  not going anywhere  thanks hank  same goes for me you know  if you ever want to bounce anything off me  i dont know case work anything really  sometimes just talking something through  you know really can make a difference  i mean were definitely not talking  you know bathtub crank here  this is a bigass operation  you know hundreds of pounds a week  maybe more  so uh  who is this person what do you know about him  other than the fact that hes deader than

perfect silence  at the stars  its a poem by walt whitman  your ww  you frickin braniac  ha you frickin braniac  ha ha ha  i must have skipped that day in school or something  i dont know hee hee  ive been chasing my tail about that one you know  i bet youre right  well im glad i could be of help  yeah walt whitman huh  so uh you think this gale person  is your heisenberg  yeah i think so i dont

i recall  at least from the first french connection  popeye doyle never actually caught him  ha  yeah i guess me and old popeye huh  a day late and a dollar short  what about the person who killed him  apds problem not mine  any leads  my buddy tim says  hes got some fingerprints theyre trying to id  and an eyewitness saw a person of interest  might get lucky there  i guess somebody knows something  theyll track down the shooter eventually  jesse  excuse me  jesse  whats up  i need to talk to you okay  now  go ahead  would you stop doing what youre doing please  when im done yo that dudes next  what the hell what is wrong  i have some business to discuss  so discuss jesus  let go of me  gales murder is being investigated  uh duh  and i have it on good authority  that they found fingerprints at the scene  not mine  we done here  no we are not done here  what if they are yours  how can you be so sure  because im here all right  your brotherinlaws got such a hardon for me  that if the cops would have found my fingerprints  shh  the cops would have found my fingerprints  within five blocks of that place  they would have picked me up by now  what about the casing  or casings how  how many times did you shoot him anyway  jesse did you pick up the casings  did you pick them up  no  listen uh weve got to go over this  step by step everything  i want you to tell me exactly what happened  from the moment you got there  i got in i got out  no no i need to know specifics  now well start from the beginning  you you drove there you drove over there  you went to his door right  jesse i need you to concentrate  this is very important  did you knock or ring  knock or ring uhh  knock  okay good thats very good  now listen  i assume that gale answered the door  now what happened after that  did he recognize you  did you say anything to each other  did you walk into the room  or did you shoot him right then and there  what  who wants to make a hundred bucks  huh  look the kids probably right  if they had anything on him  hed be locked up already  what about my brotherinlaw  he suspects jess  hell he knows jesse is involved  in the sale of blue meth  that was hanks one and only lead  now what if he puts  and he goes after jesse for the murder  he goes after him how on his rascal scooter  ahem that perhaps sounded insensitive  uh but if he goes after him  ill sue his ass for police brutality  harassment assault and 16 other things  now the history that those two have together  being what it is  you got to figure your brotherinlaws  smart enough not to go down that particular road  goose egg bupkis  thats what the cops got  i wouldnt worry about it  what else should i not worry about saul hmm  should i not worry that gus plans to murder me  at the first chance he gets  should i not worry that my drugaddicted partner  doesnt seem to care whether he lives or dies  you should see his house  its its like skid row  he has actual hobos living there  now how long before gus decides  that hes too big of a risk  geez that mike  that grunting deadeyed cretin  suckerpunching me in the in the face  ive got gus wielding a box cutter  i mean western union message received  it  let me ask you  when did this stop being a business hmm  why am i the only person  capable of behaving in a professional manner  no i  no any way you slice it everyones in danger  i mean how how can i protect anyone  my family jesse myself  my name never comes up with those guys does it  meanwhile were buying this stupid car wash  oh yeah that ship has sailed  bon voyage  we are committed  we already told our family about it  and now skyler im sure she believes  she needs to believe  that everything is neat and tidy  and shes telling herself  that i work in this nice quiet little lab  with a white lab coat and a pocket protector  and when my contract is up  ill just simply hang it all up  tip my hat and walk away  oh god  how did everything get so screwed up  yeah you do have a little shit creek action happening  you know fyi you can buy a paddle  this is a last resort back pocket kind of thing  but if you really got to protect yourself  uhdisappear  poof  poof  theres a guy who can make it happen  call him a uh  disappearer  for a substantial fee and i do mean substantial  you and your loved ones can vanish untraceable  i mean he sets you up with a whole new life  what like a  witness protection kind of thing  beyond i mean off the grid  new identities new everything  no one would ever be able to trace you  now be clear this is an end game  if you get my meaning  i mean theres no coming back  sh  you want his card  ahh  god theres got to be something else that i could do  some way to keep everything from spiraling out of control  well i mean from what you told me  it sounds like uh pinkman is first up  in the imminent demise department  gus wont risk letting the police find jesse  i know him he wont  im not even kidding  because if you really think about it  you cant even see it  so how can you know just how bad  radio frequencies and microwaves  and cell phones and stuff are getting you  i mean you could be strolling through security  at the airport on the way to visit your grandma or  wake up bitches  and then you get waved  through a fullbody xray scanner  and the next day you could be dead  or dying from all the radiation that they say is safe  but theres no way  it could be because they have to deliver  a concentrated dose okay  enough to penetrate through clothes  and so the accumulated amount  could definitely be dangerous  to susceptible individuals  hey yo  especially if youre from a rural area  and the ozone layers already thin yo  because of the cow farts  yo  oh hey  will you make sure  theres pizza here when i get back  enough for everybody  oh oh yeah i can do that  i can definitely do that all right  not a problem all right  i can get the stuff the pizza and stuff  but as as far as the financial situation you know  just hang on hang on  oh yeah you know  and you know if theres a concentrated dose  its really its gonna  its gonna play hob with your bone marrow  and its really gonna mess up  because because because especially  if you have cancer and you know  because if you got to get a bone marrow transplant  your odds are are 60  you have a 60 chance  hey  oh  hey hey  get some dipping sticks too yo  uh i can i can definitely get dipping sticks  all right i can get them  hey smoke it up bitches  gotcha  wake up  wake up  whats up  whats up with your ear  downstairs now  where is everybody  i invited your
