chalkboard  and trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table  look i understand  youre a little rusty but youre not seeing the upside here  we could really benefit from a new set of eyes  you

offer is very appealing it really is i thank you but  theres something you should know  i have some  personal issues  look theres nothing we cant work out  well yeah but its complicated  we can help

were talking  he asked how you were doing and i am sorry  but i dont have the best poker face these days  where thats concerned  he knew something was wrong with you and he pressed me  he pressed you come on  walt  when it came right down to it  i didnt know what else to do but tell him the truth  the truth how about you just said hes fine huh  maybe you couldve just have said that  hes fine and done  i dont like the way youre talking to me  i dont like the way you talk about my private affairs  to people who are not even in our lives anymore   what exactly did he say to you  he offered me a job   what  yes  kind of like some fig leaf you know  some facesaving bullshit  that allowed me to generously accept his charity  and then when i turned that down he flatout  offered to pay for my treatment  which is exactly what you expected him to do didnt you   didnt you  no   please come on  i did not put him up  okay what did you say  walt  what do you think i said  why walt   you ready to go  im taking the bus  okay  bye honey  hey dude are these bullet holes  no man those are for like you know  ventilation  cool  nice setup huh   man  this is nothing man  i used to have like twice as much glassware  until my dumbass expartner drove us into a ditch  and wrecked most of it  big ass beaker huh  wait wait no thats a yeah thats a boiling flask  this is a beaker  heres a griffin beaker

badger  dude check this out  jesus what the hell are you bringing that for  hunting  we might see javelinas  are you going to help me or what  badger  let me see the money  nah i need five each come on two more  here  what about him  are you kidding he looks younger than us  whatever  what about that guy   nah he looks like a businessman  so what  so businessmen are always in a hurry  theyre always like going to some meeting or something  seriously hes just going to say no  this guy  this is our guy  youre up  why do i have to do it  give me the crutches and ill go do it  excuse me hey  we forgot our ids and we were wondering  if you could do us a favor and buy us a sixpack  you know what youre asking is illegal  no its not  yeah it is  guess you win the jackpot  this is not how i wanted to spend my night off  consider this your first and last warning  yes sir  youre lucky you got a good dad here  if the other guys hadnt run  i couldve talked my way out of it  not cool man not cool  what you never tried to buy beer when you were my age  no im talking about you calling me and not your father  how do you think that will make him feel  i dont even know what to say to you  just go  ill deal with you later  wheres walt  i havent seen him since this morning  your guess is as good as mine  listen do me a favor all right  dont tell him about the kid  just a teenager trying to score some beer you know  you know just growing pains  i mean he finds out his dads sick he starts acting out you know  first the pot and then this  the pot   you told me he was smoking reefer  thats what skyler told me  i mean you may as well have  i wasnt talking about walter jr  i was talking about walt  excuse me  he admitted it  he said he liked it  walt  i didnt think he had it in him  its like hes not himself lately  i mean why would anyone in their right mind  choose not to do treatment  especially when its completely paid for  why is he doing this  you know what we need to do  what we really need to do is sit him down all of us  and get everything out on the table  talk it all through  you mean an intervention  no no  just a family meeting  where everyone can voice their concerns and  be heard  you are a genius bro  this cankenstein is unreal  when we get back im gonna burn that dollar bill suit  cause were gonna make some mad dough  its not right  what do you mean its not right  its cloudy  its not supposed to be cloudy  that last time it was glass  so what  cloudy not cloudy it looks good enough to me  good enough  yo what are you doing  are you out of your mind i totally wouldve smoked that  its not for you its for our customers  theyre gonna demand a certain standard  what  what are you what  well just do it again  until we get it right  walt  please have a seat and join us  we can do better  dont you fucking think about it  three entire pounds of pseudo wasted  you know how long i had to spin that stupid sign  get off me psycho  helicopter bitch  open the door  come back here you bitch  im gonna mess you up  i really need to understand your thought  process because clearly i dont  i feel  that this decision youve made  is not only not in your best interest  its not in the best interest of our entire family   look skyler  not yet please  i have the talking pillow  everybody gets to speak their minds remember  and then youll get your chance  money has always been an issue for us ill give you that  but now that elliott is more than willing to pitch in  i know i understand that its hard for you to accept help  maybe its the way you were raised  but honey  its okay to lean on people now and again  you need this treatment  and nothing can stop you from getting it  except you  am i allowed to respond  in a minute  i think we need to go around the circle first  hank would you like to start  yeah okay   well what ill say is  no take the talking pillow  all right look buddy  i know i dont get to tell you this enough but  i care about you  a hell of a lot  this cancer thing  lets just lets face it  you know you were dealt a shit hand  but  sometimes your luck can change  i mean i cant tell you how many times i was you know  i started with a shit hand and i ended up with a full house  okay  i mean the key is you gotta hang in there  man you gotta keep placing your bets keep placing your bets  hank what the hell are you saying  please marie let him talk thats what were here to do  please  go on hank  right well  look at it this way okay  its the bottom of the 9th bases are loaded  youre up  but you got a bum arm right  theres no frickin way youre gonna hit a homer  so you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat  or you can hold on to your pride and lose the game  get what im saying  no  you got your pride man i get it okay i get it  if this daddy warbucks wants to chip in im with your old lady on this one  i say take the money and run you know  somebody want to take this thing here  yes walter  walter jr im sure you have about  a million things to say probably and now is your chance  go ahead just let it all out   this is bullshit  hey come on  its all right  talk  tell your dad how you feel   im pissed off  tell him  im pissed off  cause youre being  youre  youre a pussy  youre like ready to give up  god what if you gave up on me huh  this here all the stuff ive been through  and youre scared of a little chemotherapy  me personally  i think you should do whatever you want to do  what  you told us to be honest about our feelings  walts the one with cancer its his decision  its not up to any of us  why in the hell would you do this  i wasnt planning on agreeing with walt  but after sitting here and listening to you all  talk about his future like he has no say in it  hes not gonna have a future  if he doesnt get treatment  i am a medical professional  i xray people in treatment every day  i see them every day and you know what  some of them are absolutely miserable   marie  im sorry but its true  and some of them dont wanna spend  their last weeks or months  being picked at by doctors  but they got talked into it by their families  could i get the pillow back i agree with marie on that  what maybe walt wants to die like a man  i dont want him to die at all  thats the whole point of this so either help or leave  skyler i just wanted to do you the courtesy  of giving you my honest opinion  you know marie this is not debate club  this is my husbands life   i make one simple observation  my husbands life were talking about   ladies come on  how dare you  this is so stupid  all right ive got the talking pillow now  okay  we all in this room  we love each other  we want whats best for each other and i know that  i am very thankful for that  but  what i want  what i want what i need  is a choice  what does that mean  sometimes i feel like i never actually  make any of my own  choices i mean  my entire life  it just seems i never  you know had a real say about any of it  now this last one cancer  all i have left is how i choose to approach this  then make the right choice walt  youre not the only one it affects  what about your son  dont you wanna see your daughter grow up i just  of course i do  skyler youve read the statistics  these doctors  talking about surviving  one year two years  like its the only thing that matters  but what good is it to just survive  if i am too sick to work  to enjoy a meal  to make love  for what time i have left  i want to live in my own house  i want to sleep in my own bed  i dont wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day  lose my hair and lie around  too tired to get up  and so nauseated that i cant even move my head  and you cleaning up after me  me with  some dead man some artificially alive  just marking time  no no  and thats how you would remember me  thats the worst part  so  that is my thought process skyler  im sorry  i just  i choose not to do it  all right  all right what  ill do the treatment  its gonna be okay  the lady from the billing office said  they usually bill the insurance company directly  but since our hmo is not paying for it  we can pay up front with a credit card  good  and then elliott will send a check  i will take care of it  walter white  yes  okay  see you in a minute  elliott  walt its gretchen  oh hey  hey gretchen how are you  you know it was really great seeing you two the other day  what a party  elliott told me about the cancer  im so sorry  well you know it is what it is i guess  i dont know what to say except  im always here for you  both of us are we wanted you to know that  yeah well thank you  walt elliotts told me  he had offered to pay for the treatment  you have to accept  that money as far as were both concerned  that belongs to you  even the name of our company its half yours  walt  is this about you and me  gretchen i really appreciate the offer i do  but were fine  as it turns out the insurance came through after all  so i am covered  well anyway i really appreciate it thank you  good thats good news  you know that really was a great party  keep in touch okay  sure sure  thank you for calling  you wanna cook
