much do you think you can sell on your own  say if i cooked during the days and you worked the nights   dude  what  prior to tuco that was your plan wasnt it  i understand itll be a fraction of what we brought in before  but still what choice do we have  first of all theres no we  youre talking me solo busting hump slinging shards  i got profile now  dont you get that a das up my ass  im not exposing myself to that level of risk for chump change   no way  then what do you suggest  i dont think either of us are eager to jump into bed with another tuco  i got bills man  youve got bills

financing the worlds most expensive alibi  zero zip nothing  ive got nothing to show for all of this  nothing for my family which as you might remember was the damn point  but seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option  that leaves us with a total of two choices  we go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic  or you and i start  you selling whatever you can  theres a third way  and what would that be  we got to be tuco  cut out the middle man run our own game  so youre going to what  snort meth off a bowie knife  you gonna beat your homies to death when they dis you  look i

skyhigh stacks   thats not the point  no i am not willing to do that  who said anything about you  i dont vote for this plan  im not comfortable bringing in unknown enties into our operation  you dont get to vote  i beg your pardon  this is a partnership remember  i remember  you cook i sell  that was the division of labor when we started all this  and thats exactly how we should have kept it  cause i sure as hell didnt find myself locked in a trunk  or on my knees with a gun to my head  before your greedy old ass came along all right  all right i will admit to a bit of a learning curve
