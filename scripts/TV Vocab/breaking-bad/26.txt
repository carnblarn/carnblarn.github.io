of me from now on  sure  well just as much of me at least  im taking you to the school to and from every day  what i dont get a vote in this either  i gotta stop going with louis just because youre feeling guilty  i do feel guilty  i am the man that i am son  and theres plenty that i would change about that but  here we are and this is just what it is  you know what call me crazy  but im actually feeling very good about the future  morning  theyre back  im wondering if we should maybe call the police or something  why  theyre doing nothing wrong  okay lets put this on table 33 okay  hello there  mr white i presume  oh yes hi  l  sorry ill be right down   hi gale boetticher  hi  youre my new lab assistant i take it  yes i am  i suppose youll wanna hear my qualifications  i have my rsum here for you  i received my bachelors degree from unm  my masters from the university of colorado  organic chemistry with a speciality in  its all right there  xray crystallography  really  i could talk about that for hours  i would love to  but first im curious about this  thats a little pet project of mine  see in my opinion its all about the quinic acid level  you want just north of 4800 milligrams per litre  but if you overboil to get there youll leach your tannins  bitterness yuck  so i pull a mild vacuum  that way i can keep the temperature no higher than 92 c and  judge for yourself  oh my god  my god that is the best coffee ive ever tasted  sumatran beans  and i also have to give credit to the grind  but thank you mr white  walt  please call me walt  why the hell are we making meth  hey  tell me  with the phenylacetic acid solution  you said 150 drops per minute for the first 10 minutes  and then 90 for the remainder why is that  well my thinking is by tapering the phenyl  you get an oilier aqueous layer and hence  better benzene extraction  exactly  but actually i prefer ether  oh ill have it for tomorrow  gale im wondering how you  ended up here  well actually im still wondering how i ended up here but yes  i mean i cant imagine we strike each other as criminals  well theres crime and then theres crime  i suppose  im definitely a libertarian  consenting adults want what they want  and if im not supplying it they will get it somewhere else  with me theyre getting exactly what they pay for  no added toxins or adulterants  yeah i was doing it the way you are supposed to  pursuing my doctorate at colorado nsf research grant  i was on my way jumping through hoops  kissing the proper behinds  attending to all the nonchemistry that one finds oneself occupied by  you know that world  that is not what i signed on for  i love the lab  because its all still magic  you know  chemistry  i mean  once you lose that  it is  it is magic  it still is  and all the while i kept thinking about that great old whitman poem  when i heard the learnd astronomer  i dont know it  anyway  well can you recite it  pathetically enough i could  all right well  no no come on come on  yeah  when i heard the learnd astronomer  when the proofs the figures were ranged in columns before me  when i was shown the charts and the diagrams  to add divide and measure them  when i sitting heard the astronomer  where he lectured with much applause in the lectureroom  how soon unaccountable i became tired and sick  till rising and gliding out  i wanderd off by myself  in the mystical moist nightair  and from time to time  lookd up in perfect silence at the stars  yes  i am a nerd   bravo  thank you  come on pinkman  you little rat bastard  get off your lazy ass and go break the law   hey baby  are you ever coming home  marie im working  did you find it the rv  no working on it so  why cant you just arrest him make him tell you  its not simple theres a thing called
