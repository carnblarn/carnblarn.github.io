ahead kid  smoke up  hmm  mmm  good morning  hey good morning son  you want me to pour you some juice  ill take coffee  didnt know you started drinking coffee  yeah i also started tying my own shoelaces too  all by myself  go grab a mug  milk sugar  just black  black i like it  uh hey dad i uh  i i just got to say um  i i just wanted to say  that its really cool to have you here  thank you son  its cool to be back home  it just feels  mom said youre moving back in uh this tuesday  she she said that  yeah  tuesday is it huh  how about that  jesse  jesse  yo whats up  what are you doing  uh breaking ice  i mean what are you  what are you doing here  wheres your car  mike dropped me off  jesse  jesse  what happened yesterday where were you  i was out with mike helping him make pickups  picking up what  cash dead drops  mike made the pickups and i guarded them  you  guarded mike  what is this some kind of a joke  hey you know what two dudes tried to rob us  and i saved the stash i took care of business  just like im taking care of business right now  you want to stand there dicking around  or you want to suit up and get to work  get in gear yo if you want to do this  because im meeting up with mike this afternoon  what again why  guess i have two jobs now  may i take your order  any injuries  twisted ankle nothing too bad  it all went like you thought it would  more or less  i will of course reimburse you  to the damage to your vehicles  hmm  questions  uhhuh more than a few yeah  but i know better than to ask  anyway it was like you wanted  the kids a hero  poopoopoopoopoo  just the idea of owning a car wash  seems daunting but i had to warn myself  who is just the most beautiful little girl in the world  i think its you  so coming into a business like this  thats up and running fully operational  puts us way ahead of the game  you know were still going to have  some change over time  i think its you yeah i do  but we do have a staff in place  so you know luckily well be able to hold on  to most of bogdans employees  we might lose a few to the ultra wash across town though  theyre making a grab i hear  you going to put the kid to work  i got school  im not talking about you  im talking about your baby sister  i wouldnt let you near my car  hey thats not a bad idea you guys  you should put holly on the sign  like a mascot  like the gerber baby  i would get my car washed there every day  if i saw her face out front  what about me  the goal is to bring customers in  not scare them away so  walt theres another bottle in the kitchen  just help yourself  ah good  uh maybe we could roll uncle hank  through the car wash  he could be the first customer  the wipedown crew would clean you up good  see this son  i got your wipedown right here pal  hank can you just maybe get through one meal  without you saying something disgusting  so what are you going to do with holly all day  you cant take her to work  with all those chemicals and migrants hanging around  marie  what that cant be safe  fortunately there is  just five minutes away from the car wash  there is the top child care center in the city  the national child care association  gives it really high ratings so thats quite a relief  and you know its just a walk away if we need it  i got to tell you  im just im really really impressed  i mean you came together on this  and im really happy that its working out for you  thanks  it was a little scary  but it uh needed to be done  and uh we get possession of the keys tomorrow  oh thats awesome  yeah  i cant wait to see  what kind of car ill get for my birthday  now with all this money rolling in  i think youve been spending too much time  around your uncle hank  the squeaky wheel gets the grease  right uncle hank  squeaky and greasy thats you my friend  hey uh nick the greek  you going to share that bottle or what  oh yeah sorry  whos nick the greek  nick the greek he was a famous bigtime card player  hank thats not funny  what its a compliment  well thats even worse then  youre giving positive reinforcement to behavior  that walt is working very very hard to change  right skyler  yeah  i dont see how its bad dad  just raking in the beaucoup bucks now  you know i just uh think  maybe we could change the subject  yeah sure you know  absolutely  hey uncle hank what about that case you were looking at  with that crazy singing guy  ah im off that  i i gave my assessment to the apd and im done  the case of the crazy singing guy hmm  sounds like an encyclopedia brown story doesnt it  crazy is is is uh is the wrong word  this guy gale boetticher  he was uh he was eccentric  i mean a real character you know  hes uh hes dead now you know  huh who was he  he was a meth cook  uh he was a meth chef  i mean were talking five stars  candles and white tablecloths  hey i cant believe these words  are gonna come out of my mouth  but he was a genius plain and simple  i mean uh boy if you applied that big brain of his  to something good i dont know  who knows what could have helped humanity  or something like that you know  i mean how many actual geniuses are there  in the world right  if hed kind of taken his life in a different direction  who knows  hank not to tell you your business  but im not sure i agree  what do you mean  well i mean  you showed me that notebook  and from what i saw  and this is just my humble opinion  from what i saw on those papers  genius  not so much  i mean there was no reasoning  no deductions in those pages  to my eye all this brilliance  looks like nothing more  than just simple rote copying  probably of someone elses work  believe me ive been around enough students to know  ah this genius of yours  maybe hes still out there  hank  hey babe  uh tim stopped by  he brought over some file boxes  on that case  thought id take another peek  thats great  sorry about the mess  no no no dont be  you want me to make some coffee  yeah  yeah that would be good  hmm  you find something  oh just this this guy im looking at  you know everything he he he buys and eats  is organic fair trade vegan  since when do vegans eat fried chicken
