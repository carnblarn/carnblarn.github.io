                yo i thought i was gonna see some like vaginas  i didnt say she actually painted vaginas  i said some of her paintings looked like vaginas  seriously not even close  georgia okeeffe painted all kinds of stuff  everyday items her surroundings  some of it evoked an erotic nature  its who she was  not like any vagina i ever saw  this chick have medical issues  this particular painting  is of a door  any other doors we can check out  like real ones or  you know i dont get it  why would anyone paint a picture of a door  over and over again like dozens of times   but it wasnt the same  yeah it was  it was the same subject but different every time  the light was different her mood was different  she saw something new every time she painted it  and thats not psycho to you  well then why should we do anything more than once  should i just smoke this one cigarette  maybe we should only have sex once if its the same thing   whoa no  should we just watch one sunset  or live just one day  its new every time each time is a different experience  okay fine  i guess the cow skull pictures were cool but a door  i will say it again a door  why not a door sometimes you get fixated on something  and you might not even get why  you open yourself up and go with the flow  wherever the universe takes you  okay so the universe took her to a door  and she got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it 20 times  until it was perfect  i wouldnt say that nothings perfect  yeah well  i mean  some things  that was so sweet i think i threw up in my mouth a bit  you cant admit just for once that im right  come on that okeeffe lady kept trying over and over  until that stupid door was perfect  no that door was her home and she loved it  to me thats about making that feeling

driving by myself  you dont turn 16 for two more months  it doesnt matter its a provisional  look it up they changed the law like 10 years ago  yeah well i didnt vote for that  doesnt matter if you voted for it its the law  so both of you start thinking about what kind of car you wanna buy me  i think id be good with either an old iroc or a stang  a stang  how about something with playing cards in the spokes  makes a nice motory sound you know  dad youre not gonna get off that easy  well i think that this is  we should probably table this discussion for later  your dad and i have a couple things we need to talk about so  okay  a 1971 mach 1 fastback  in grabber lime with a shaker hood  stang  ill write that down so we dont forget oh darn it no pencil  what is ice station zebra associates  its a loan out its fine  whose loan out  its fine really  i  have a guy  okay  does your guy know the tax code and regulations in new mexico  theres very specific paperwork that has to be submitted quarterly on this  yes my guy is a top  guy  who is he  whats his name what are his qualifications  walt this money has to be unimpeachable  when it reaches hank and marie  and it is it will be  but how do i know that i mean you cant even tell me the mans name  jesus skyler do you really wanna know  do you really wanna know  really  what a pleasure it is to have you  im gonna call you skyler if thats okay its a lovely name  reminds me of a big beautiful sky  walt never told me how lucky he was prior to recent unfortunate events  his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers  only the very best with just the right amount of dirty  thats a joke thats a joke  it funny because you are so clearly very classy  here please sit down  so walt tells me that you have some concerns i can alleviate  yes i do i have  concerns  if were going to go down this road  and clearly we are for the sake of my brotherinlaw  ive heard about him hes an american hero  at any rate i need some assurances that were gonna go about this  in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious  fair enough ill walk you through the process  first step is something we like to call money laundering all right  take your money represented by say these jelly beans  you know im a bookkeeper so i actually  i know what money laundering is   well  yeah  and as with most things the devil is in the details  so to begin with what are we saying is the source of this money  thats simple  walt here actually came up with a great story about gambling winnings  blackjack right some cardcounting system  well actually that was skylers idea  well you grow more gorgeous by the minute  there you have it  ill generate false currency transaction reports out the wazoo  as well as the necessary w2gs i know a couple casino managers  who will jump at the chance to report false losses  its a winwin for everyone  yeah but you cant sell that for very long  yeah yeah yeah way ahead of you  we declare just enough not to arouse suspicion  then walts onetime winnings become seed money for an investment  investment in what  drum roll please wait for it  laser tag  laser tag seven thousand square feet of rollicking fun  in the heart of northern bernalillo county  laser tag  yeah theres guns and glow lights and kids wear the vests  yeah no no i actually i know what it is  its just that in relation to walt its  i mean it doesnt make any sense  makes more sense than you two being together  do you even know walt i mean how would he of all people  buy a laser tag business it doesnt add up  it adds up perfectly walts a scientist scientists love lasers  plus they got bumper boats so  hey everybody  walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag just out of the blue  really thats what were supposed to tell people our family our friends  the government  let me bottom line this for you you dont need to be involved okay  ive been doing this for a lot of years  successfully believe it or not without your help  so thank you for stopping by  you want a beer or something  or something  what do you mean  like beer  im cleaned out of anything else  even if i wasnt were not supposed to  yeah  ive heard it over and over and over again  you know dont you think its ridiculous  that society says beer is okay  and a little hit of something sweet is wrong  i mean whats the point of shutting yourself off completely  from something that lifts you off the ground  i spend so much energy fighting the urge not to use  and i feel like crap because of it   i know its just  what  i cant get caught using again  see the thing is  not to get caught  you ever try that blue stuff thats going around  just a little gas in the tank  and suddenly everything is interesting  man i wish i could make that feeling last  like i said i got nothing here  what if i could get some   mommy mommy  hey baby  your nana brought you home early  grandma i thought you were keeping brock today  i was then i saw your car   i thought you had a meeting  i did but we changed the time  grandma this is jesse hes from the meeting  hes like a sponsor jesse this is grandma  jesse this is brock  so you have a kid huh  whats up  brock huh  thats a cool name  here give it up  brock is almost 6 you okay with kids  what yeah yeah hes cool  okay brock is gonna go play in his room while the big people talk  hes gonna go play with his legos and his cars   say bye jesse  bye jesse  hope you had a good time at grandmas  oh i fixed your blue car do you remember  the convertible one  you can jump on your bed play with your toys  safe and cautious thats all im asking and that man  is neither  ill admit he comes across like a circus clown  but he knows what hes doing  and safe and cautious is you not being involved in this at all  well its a little late on that  this is what happens when you decide to pay our bills with drug money  skyler  this isnt just about what happened before  my involvement in this is ongoing  understand  i cant just quit  i have something of a contract  but its all very safe professional  structured  like i cant simply quit  where you going  if youre gonna launder money walt  at least do it right  you worked here four years  its a business you understand  its a story people will believe  not laser tag this  this is what we buy  you  this is what you buy  yeah i mean theres free donuts nothings wrong with a free donut  hey jesse right  brandon peter how goes it hanging in there  can we please just  dumbass  sorry man i was trying to keep it on the dl  so you and that girl do the deed yet  do what  you know sell to her  what are you two even doing here  what do you mean  you cant get your nut up to sell whats the point of even coming  homey im on like step five  deuce yo im catching up  whatever later  hey  dude needs to come into the fold  yup  hey you know what i have magical powers  you wanna see  ready  thats not real  it is real all right do you wanna see something real  look at this watch this  ready  you like that  thats science and stuff makes it do that   do it again  let jesse eat his dinner brock  oh its okay its okay wanna see it again  could you do a trick with firecrackers  firecrackers  you know i dont have any firecrackers on me   who does tricks with firecrackers  tomas  tomas does tricks with firecrackers huh whos tomas   hes my kid brother  yeah  and we dont talk about him  come on eat your food brock  can i have a chip im gonna steal your chip  hey thats mine  thats it thats what you wanna buy  people will believe it at least  i worked here for four years  wax on wax off was that you  hey how come you guys always give air freshener  i explicitly say no air freshener  and every time i drive away smelling like an alpine whorehouse  all due respect i dont see it so i vote no  it makes a better story than your laser tag  is that you talking or yoko ono  she has a point it makes more sense that i invest right here  based on her years of experience in money laundering i suppose  if youre committed enough you can make any story work  i once convinced a woman that i was kevin costner  and it worked because i believed it all right  has nothing to do with the story  besides this dump isnt gonna work because it doesnt have a danny  theres no danny here  what in gods name is a danny  danny runs the laser tag danny is the guy who had a vision  where others saw a dirt lot he saw black lights rubber aliens  teenagers running around with ray guns right  like bugsy siegel in the desert  when the stock market took a shit and danny got into trouble  he went searching for exactly the type of situation were offering  danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat  in other words danny can be trusted completely  that guy the guy with the eyebrows that wont quit is he a danny  you buy this place all you got is a big building that squirts water  you got no danny here  you wanna stay for dinner  yeah  thanks  what time is it  early still  so  what  thought maybe if youre holding we can do something  what  you know that blue stuff you were talking about   maybe you had a line on some  wait  what  thought you said the kid is coming home  yeah in a few hours  and you seriously wanna get high  i dont know what youre getting pissed about  youre the one who brought it up  yeah that was before i found out you got a kid  what kind of mother are you  what  you heard me what kind of mom gets wasted with a kid to take care of  nobody can say i dont take care of my son  you come in my house and judge me  like you got no responsibilities so its okay for you  what do you know about me  i take care of my baby ill do anything for him  the day brock was born i swore  i wont let what happened to tomas happen to my son  ill die first  sorry i  i just  look ill get out of here if you want  thats what you wanna do then go  its not what i want  look i was out of line talking about that stuff  we both were  youre right  i dont know what youve been through  you can tell me if you want  this whole neighbourhoods run by gangs  they run the drugs control the streets  they sort of took tomas in  no dad around  eight years old  they got tomas slinging  part of some crew  then when he was 10  for some initiation or something  they made him kill somebody  i heard the rumours i didnt believe it at first  but then i saw him like a week later  and he told me yeah he did it  they gave tomas a gun  gave him a choice  him or some dude  so he did it  told me all about it like it was nothing  who did he say he killed  some dealer  from some outside crew  right around the corner from here over off of central  just rode up on his bike and shot him  off of central  like over by the train tracks  when was this  few months back  what else did he tell you  he shot the guy right through the neck  shot him dead  just because he was working the wrong corner  it wont happen again  not to my son  guess what  people who say guess what and then actually expect you to guess  i hate those people  well i just heard  about a certain patient named schradercommahank  who is going to be released at the end of this week  isnt that fantastic  they plan on rolling me out the front door  or put me on a greased plank and slide me out the window  hey  i dont care what any damned insurance company thinks   im not leaving here till im well  hank this isnt about insurance  ive talked to everybody they all say you are healthy enough to go home   im healthy enough huh yeah  hank you get stronger every day  you dont need to be in a hospital  in this condition yeah i do  youll be just as comfortable at home as you are here   youll have all the same equipment  same equipment whats that mean  the equipment that you have here that you need shortterm  youll do your pt at home and itll be great  because youll be home  wait till you see the bedroom i had them move the plasma in  i know thats how you always wanted it  you only had to get shot to get it right   i got you a new bed  a hospital bed  well  you put a hospital bed in my bedroom  hank  youll be home  you get that out of my house  you hear me marie  today   hank  i leave this hospital  when i walk out of here you understand  and not before  whats a danny  dannys an accomplice  someone whos in on the scheme who knows about laundering  whos paid to look the other way  now while i agree with you that laser tag is a hard sell  without a danny the car wash isnt really an option  and he cant get you another danny to run the car wash  easier said than done  if were looking for someone trustworthy  what about me  what about you  me  ill be the danny  no no no skyler that is not a good idea  im capable of managing a small business  a legal business not this  who else could we trust   no  walt  im in this   and if im in it im gonna do it right  no   you are not in this you are not  were married how am i not in this  we are not married skyler were divorced  right  i never actually got around to filing the papers  married couples cant be compelled to testify against one another  so theres that  jesse jesse  respirator  right  yes  yes all right okay  yeah ill be there  what was that  an invitation  walter youre right on time  please come in  i hope you like paila marina  its a fancy name for fish stew  it sounds like a clich but indeed its just like my mother used to make it  come on you can help me cook  this is a chilean dish that i love  but i never get to make it  kids wont eat it  but  you know how that is  sure  do you mind  would you slice the garlic  very thin  why did you invite me here  were working together  why not break bread together  now the garlic  it always amazes me the way the senses work in connection to memory  i mean this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients  taken separately these ingredients alone dont remind me of anything  i mean not very much at all  but in this precise combination the smell of this meal  instantly it brings you back to my childhood  how is that possible  basically it takes place in the hippocampus  neural connections are formed  the senses make the neurons express signals  that go right back to the same part of the brain as before  where memory is stored  its something called relational memory  dont quote me on that im  im rusty on my biology  thats very interesting  walter  i would like to help you if i could  help me how  well when i first started out i made a lot of mistakes  more than i care to admit  i wish id had someone to advise me  because this life of ours  it can overwhelm  you are a wealthy man now  and one must learn to be rich  to be poor anyone can manage  what advice do you have for me  never make the same mistake twice  hey  whats up  you you tomas  i heard you were the man  yeah what you want  crystal  you think you could hook me up   three hundred  for a teenth  shit come on yo  three hundred  hey whats up  hey yo  bounce
