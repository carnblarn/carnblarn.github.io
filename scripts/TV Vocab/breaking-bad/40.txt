that youd forget  well let alone gale  let alone victor  and all the horror that goes along with all of that  what about this girlfriend of yours  and her little brother  the man looked you straight in the eye  and told you no more children  but that very night that little boy  he winds up  gus cant possibly think that youd forget that   okay  i mean all im saying is that  is it possible he would think that youre that weakwilled  drop the sales pitch  ill do it  youll do what  ill kill him  first chance i get  pia colada more like stale bubblegum  does anyone actually want their car to smell

pocket  keep it out of sight  if youre gonna be here today youre gonna have a gun  its loaded  i dont want to see that in your hand  unless you see me with mine  understood  emergency only  first car is coming  all right whats the order of the day  eyes open mouth shut  a lot of guns  nobodys asking you to give up yours  you want to sweep the place before you bring in your guys  i am the guy  all right then  you got something of mine  glove box  figure i better teach you how to shoot  could be things are gonna get hairy  what is this  youre giving me a gun  and now im like part of the team or whatever  he said he sees something in me  like what  if i had to put it in a word  id guess  loyalty  loyalty  only maybe you got it for the wrong guy  jesse  hey  long time no see  how you doing  yeah you know uh  good  good  okay were going to get started  you coming in  so the truth is we cant change the past  whats done is done  weve got to own our actions  but putting ourselves on trial  acting as our own judge jury and executioner  its not the answer  because a lot of the time all that judging does  is just ensure that were going to repeat the cycle  right  im such an asshhole   its totally hopeless   whats the point  i think ill have a hit   jesse  whats going on with you these days  i went back to the crystal  you sober now  yeah  four days big whoop right  four days is four days  youre here  you still working at the laundry  how are things there  sucks ass  anything you want to talk about  uh  a couple of weeks back  i uh  killed a dog  you hit it with your car  no um  i put him down  i watched him go  i was looking him straight in the eye  and  you know he didnt know what was happening  he didnt know why he  he was just scared and then  he was gone  he was suffering  it was a kindness  no he wasnt sick  no he was just like a  i dont know like a  problem dog  what did he do  bite someone  uh this dog never never bit anybody  he was uh  you pick up the rock you go right to the dark side  anything can happen  it aint no rock that made me do it  well what was the problem  why did you have to kill him  watch the crosstalk please  maybe its not the details that matter  right  howd you feel about what you did jesse  i dont know  who cares how you feel  what kind of a person kills a dog for no reason  colleen  you put an ad in the paper  you drop him off at a shelter   colleen  you just dont sit there  and talk about killing a helpless   colleen   innocent animal  were not here to sit in judgment  why not  why not maybe maybe shes right  you know maybe i should have put it in the paper  maybe i should have done something different  the thing is  if you just do stuff and nothing happens  whats it all mean  whats the point  all right this whole thing is about selfacceptance  kicking the hell out of yourself  doesnt give meaning to anything  so i should stop judging   and accept  its a start  so no matter what i do  hooray for me because im a great guy  its all good  no matter how many dogs i kill  i just what do an inventory  and accept  i mean you back your truck over your own kid  and you like accept  what a load of crap  hey jesse i know youre in pain  no yyou know what  why im here in the first place  is to sell you meth  youre nothing to me but customers  i made you my bitch  you okay with that  huh  you accept  no  about time  jesse jesse  bring that light over here will you  you see any residue there  where  here on the bottom right right there  its been a week  whats going on  i havent seen him  i didnt think so  but ill just give it another shot anyway   heyheyhey buddy  hey  look at that graduated to doorman  finally found your calling  ha ha ooh little whiskers marie  what did you do show your barber a picture of a dogs ass  and said ill take that  charming as usual welcome back  looking good marie  oh thanks steve good to see you   how you doing  hes doing fine  we uh we can take it from here   right gomie  yeah  if you want to hold his elbow  no no no no you keep your mitts off me  im good im good  hey  good luck  lets go running late come on  hank seeing you walk in  i cant tell you what that means to all of us  your progress its incredible  yeah well chalk it up  to can living and vitamin pills  steve tell you his news  what finally got your period  i made gs 14  wow thats all right man  next stop washington dc  sitting behind a desk  papers piled so high you cant see over them  hey better you than me buddy  seriously congratulations buddy  thanks  steve said you might have something for us  yeah maybe  you guys are going to have to tell me  remember my pal tim roberts  apd detective  yeah well hes working on a murder case  and the victims a 34yearold male caucasian  by the name of gale boetticher  one night last month boetticher opens the door  bam take a bullet to the face  from a person or persons unknown  now this gale boetticher is a bona fide chemistry genius  i mean hes got degrees up the wazoo right  and uh as you might expect hes a nerds nerd  vegan sandals and socks kind of guy  as it turns out hes also an anumber 1 meth cook  and what caught my eye  is uh his specialty products blue  so what are you thinking  this is your heisenberg  no what i think we got here is uh ahem  heisenbergs former cook  and maybe a line on heisenberg himself  anyway uh lo and behold  amidst all the hippiedippie nonsense ahem  i find this  now this here i do a little googlefu  and i i realize its a parts number  specifically for this baby  now that there is a highvolume  hepa industrial air filtration system  thats a 300000 gadget  perfect for a pharmaceutical plant  or microchip factory  or maybe the biggest meth lab north of the border  okay  so this little dingus here is manufactured  by a big international concern  madrigal electromotive  i call their houston office and eventually i get through  to the nicest little  i use some of the schrader sweet talk on her  before you know it shes pulling files for me  turns out six months ago  one of these systems was shipped to a depot  right here in abq  who signed for it  gale boetticher  so i asked my new girlfriend who paid for it  and she says nobody   they have no record  that anybody actually paid for this thing  so i go back and push more and before you know it  uh the temps gone theres no forwarding address  and im talking to some snotnose corporate lawyer  whos asking me for my badge number  brick wall  so i take a peek into madrigal electromotive  now madrigal is based in hanover germany  but theyre what they call highly diversified  industrial equipment global shipping  major construction  and a tiny little foothold in american fast food  specifically a local chain  pollos hermanos  okay so what right  boettichers dead  i got no line on whos been bankrolling him  or where his lab was  the whole things a snipe hunt right  but now i get this crazy idea  and i cant shake it  i mean i i stay up nights staring at the ceiling  and trying to make sense of it  its that napkin  remember i told you boettichers vegan right  i mean were talking this guy makes  his own fermented lentil bread  or whatever the hell that is  whats a vegan doing in a fried chicken joint  maybe hes meeting somebody  like who  well like maybe  this guy  i mean what do we know about gustavo fring  huh this whole friend of law enforcement thing eh  could be a case of keep your friends close but your enemies closer  hes got the money to finance this operation  maybe hes got the connections too  maybe just maybe  hes our guy  hank no offense  but i think youre really reaching  if your guy had his meeting at kfc  you wouldnt immediately assume  that hes sitting down with colonel sanders  you know i ahem  i couldnt agree more guys  gustavo fring blue meth you know  the whole thing is offthemap nuts  i ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat you know  except  i cant seem to wrap my mind around this one little thing  and that is  what are gustavo frings fingerprints  doing in gale boettichers apartment
