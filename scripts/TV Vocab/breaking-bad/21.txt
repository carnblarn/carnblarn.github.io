fateful mistak e  which brought about the crash   is donald margolis a 19year veteran  of the faas air route traffic control center in albuquerque   margolis recently returned to work after a fiveweek

apparently had a long history of substance abuse  friends of the family say  the death of his only child hit margolis particularly hard  coming as it did little more than a month before  many are

soon  okay  may i have your attention please  as all of you know last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy  one that none of us will ever forget  which is why today were going to tak e a little time out of our schedule  to gather in the gym and talk  i just find it you know really really hard to concentrate  because of all the horrors you know we perceived  it just really gets inside your brain and  in college they have this thing where if your roommate kills himself  like if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever  its basically an automatic a for you  and i just think that that kind of compassion is   is something to  okay thank you barry  who wants to go next  no judgments guys just feelings  you can say anything and everything thats on your mind anyone  there you go honey  i just keep asking myself  honey could you please stand up  thank you  i just keep asking myself why did this happen  i mean if theres a god and all  why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason  okay can we just keep it secular honey  anyhow i havent really been sleeping much  does anyone else have that  i just keep hearing that sound  that boom  it just plays over and over in my head like it wont ever stop  thank you sweetheart   is there anyone else  over here  my neighbour he heard the crash  and he ran outside and he found like this seat  like an airline seat  like what you have on a airliner  well anyway the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard  right next to his seadoos because like he has seadoos  but there was still a pair of legs buckled into them  human legs  jesus h christ   you okay  yeah sorry im  i was just moved  maybe we should hear from the faculty  certainly this tragedy didnt only affect our students  mr white would you like to say something  and by the way welcome back  its so good to have you back  i guess what i would sorry sorry  i guess what i would wanna say is  to look on the bright side  first of all nobody on the ground was killed  and that  i mean an incident like this over a populated urban centre  that right there thats just gotta be some minor miracle so  plus neither plane was full  you know the 737 was what maybe twothirds full i believe right yes  or maybe even threequarters full  well at any rate what youre left with casualtywise  is just the 50thworst air disaster  actually tied for 50th  there are in truth  53 crashes throughout history  that are just as bad or worse tenerife  has anybody anybody hear of tenerife no  in 1977 two fully loaded 747 s  crashed into each other on tenerife  does anybody know how big a 747 is  i mean its way bigger than a 737 and were talking about two of them  nearly 600 people died on tenerife  but do any of you even remember it at all any of you i doubt it  you know why its because people move on  they just move on  and we will too we will move on and we will get past this  because that is what human beings do we survive and  we survive and we overcome yeah  we survive we survive and   okay  thank you  good  hey hows your aunt marie doing  fine i guess  you make sure you say hello to her for me will you  why dont you just come inside its your house  no i  hes gone  hey flynn hows tricks   hows what  tricks its an expression  how are you  why you gotta treat him like this  why you gotta be like this   why cant you just talk even  hey hey hey cool down okay  out of the mouths of babes huh  you know try not to hold it against him  you know i mean the poor kid hes probably just dying of curiosity  you know and i guess it would be natural for him to wonder  hes probably wondering what is it that could have gone so wrong   marie marie that my mother would leave  i cant help you get through this  you know if you wont tell me what it is that walt did  well you know what i dont remember asking you all right  so if you wanna be supportive you could be supportive without prying   that would be really great  prying  and so helpful  well pryings a strong word  its that voice inside your head  its that sneaky ratbastard  you know what im talking about  that voice that tells you youre not good enough  not good enough for what not good enough to be what  president of the united states  well okay so maybe youre not that good  but now  are you good enough to dese your share of basic human happiness  are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are  i say yes  but it doesnt matter what i say  its your voice which means youre the one that hears it  which means youre the only one that can fight it right  jesse we never hear from you  whats going on you can tell me im full of shit its okay i dont mind  just come on let us in on it  so like what makes you the expert  i dont think i ever said i was that  yeah but youre the one sitting here right  telling us thus and so be happy forgive yourself blah blah blah  have you ever really hurt anybody  i dont just mean disappointed your mother or whatever  but did you ever really hurt someone  i killed my daughter  it was july 18th which is my birthday  july 18th 1992  i was high on cocaine and i was drunk  cocaine wasnt an issue i had bought myself two grams as a birthday present  i had plenty left  but i was out of vodka  and this is in portsmouth virginia  where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets  they have these abc stores  which close at 5 pm and right then it was like 442  so im arguing with my wife  come on go to the abc for me its my birthday  come on theyre not gonna sell it to me  and shes saying no no  so im pissed and the clock is ticking so i jump in my truck  shes my 6yearold daughter  shes playing at the end of the driveway  so  how do you not hate yourself  i did hate myself for a long time  but it didnt stop me from drinking and getting high  it just made it that much worse  selfhatred guilt it accomplishes nothing  it just stands in the way  stands in the way of what  true change  skyler  is this a good time to talk  yeah come in please  skyler  do you wanna start  okay  why are you doing this why are you even thinking this way   is it to punish me  i am not punishing you walt  this is punitive is what this is we are happily married  i am happily married i am happy were just  i love you skyler and i would do anything for you  would you even consider i mean jesus  you come in here and you wave these papers in my face  when theres a whole other entire side to this thing  theres your side and theres my side and you havent heard my side yet  you havent heard any of it at all  youre a drug dealer  no what how what  yeah  how else could you possibly make that kind of money  marijuana that pinkman kid  no  oh my god walt  cocaine  its methamphetamine  but im a manufacturer im not a dealer  per se  it doesnt mean no skyler   listen to me skyler listen  no no  there are a lot of angles to this okay its complicated all right  so please lets please lets just sit back down and

our lives back together again  and on the straight and narrow  you been following this airplane crash  yeah  you know it was janes dad who accidentally crashed them together  because he was so torn up  okay look let me stop you right there all right  you are not responsible for this  not in any way shape or form all right  now i am very uptodate on this thing probably far more than you are  and there are many factors at play there  yeah  for instance theres some sort of collision radar on the jet  that may not have been working  thats public record you can look that up  and the whole system is run on 1960s technology  no  no really i blame the government  you either run from things or you face them mr white   what exactly does that mean  i learned it in rehab  its all about accepting who
