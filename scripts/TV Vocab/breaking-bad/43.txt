and met with your mr beneke  which i will say again loudly and for the record bad idea  yes but it is better than prison correct  marginally  which is why i disbursed the funds as you requested  all right good  yeah i cant believe he actually bought it  greataunt birgit  what but you called it  i guess people see those zeroes dance before their eyes  its kind of like highway hypnosis  all right so whats the problem  lets just say you and i  dont wear the same rosecolored glasses  where johnny fabulous is concerned  so i kept an eye on his bank accounts  and i pulled his credit report  if you would note the time on that   three hours after leaving my office  he bought a mercedes sl550  hes actually leasing it but he put 4500 down  hes going to pay  fully loaded  i mean he even got the heated steering wheel  but thats upwards of 6300  that wont be going to the irs  i just thought you might like to know  loath as i am to say i told you so  where is he now  chuckles  sighs  hey  groans  how you doing  good  how are you  im fine but your mother is going to be worried sick  i called her last night  i told her i was spending the night at louis  its cool  so hhhow are you  im fine son  i  i  i took these painkillers  that i had left over from my surgery  and i made the brilliant decision  to wash them down with a couple of beers  not my most sterling moment i admit  but im fine  i wish i could take back last night  it was your birthday this shouldnt be on your mind  its okay  no its not okay  im your father  and i dont want  last night to be  i mean you really  you cant think of me like  like what  i dont understand  my father died when i was 6  you knew that right  yeah  he had huntingtons disease  its  destroys portions of the brain  affects muscle control leads to dementia  its just a nasty disease  its genetic  it terrified my mother that i might have it  so they ran tests on me when i was a kid  but i came up clean  my father fell very ill when i was 4 or 5  he spent a lot of time in the hospital  my  chuckles  my mother would tell me so many stories  about my father  she would talk about him all the time  i knew about his personality  how he treated people  i even knew how he liked his steaks cooked  medium rare  both chuckle just like you  i knew things about my father  i had a lot of information  its because people would tell me these things  they would paint this picture  of my father for me  and i always pretended  that was who i saw too  who i remembered  but it was a lie  in truth i only have one real actual memory of my father  it mustve been right before he died  my mother would take me to the hospital to visit him  and i remember the smell in there  the chemicals  it was as if they use up  every single cleaning product they could find  in a 50mile radius  like they didnt want you smelling the sick people  oh there was this stench  of lysol and bleach  you could just feel it coating your lungs  anyway there lying on the bed  is my father  hes all hes all twisted up  and my mom she puts me on her lap  shes sitting on the bed next to him  so i can get a good look at him  but really he just scares me  and hes looking right at me  but i cant even be sure that he knows who i am  and your grandmother  is talking  trying to be cheerful you know as she does  but the only thing i could remember  is him breathing  oh th this  this rattling sound  like if you were shaking an empty spraypaint can  huh  like there was nothing in him  anyway  that is the only real memory that i have of my father  i dont want you to think of me the way i was last night  i dont want that  to be the memory you have of me  when im gone  rremembering you that way  wouldnt be so bad  the bad way to remember you would be the way  the way youve been this whole last year  at least last night you were  you were real  you know  bye  somewhere you should be  basically it was a temporary hiatus  but you give us two weeks  we will be up and running 100  all right you talk to your people and get back to me okay  yeah thanks tanya  okay you bet  say hi to the kids for me  hey hi  nice surprise  whats up  just thought id swing by see how things were going  well things are  chuckles things took a turn  its kind of crazy  oh yeah  i think the universe is trying to tell me something  ive got some good news some very good news  and getting the business going again  wow chuckles  yeah i figure we havent been down long  so we should be able to get most of our old contracts back  sit down  oh thank you  thats gosh thats  thats wow laughs  how is that even possible  i got a very unexpected cash infusion  huh  guess someones looking out for me  i guess so  is that yours outside  oh yeah you know  cant be driving a piece of crap to customer meetings  youve got to present that successful image  yeah right right  so the irs stuff thats resolved  yeah its in progress  so you paid them  well not yet but i will  when  well its not that simple  um heres the thing  i never had proper legal counsel  so i was thinking  i should hire someone good  who can maybe hammer out a better deal  there will never be a better deal ted  the deal is you pay your back taxes  you pay your penalty  and you dont go to prison  thats a good deal  so lets keep our priorities straight here right  well my priority is getting my business back  and putting my employees back on the payroll  so they can pay their mortgages  right but i think your employees would agree  that you need to get your financial situation in control  before you can help them  boy irs got you on commission  no im just saying that though i really do  i understand the temptation to restart the business  maybe the universe is telling you  that you need to pay what you owe  skyler this is my money  and why are we having this conversation  youre no longer a part of my life  a decision you made by the way  so i dont understand why youre hectoring me about this  ted this affects both of us  no it doesnt  im telling you you need to drop this  you need to use that money to pay your bill  by the end of this month  which you promised the irs in writing  that you would do  it is that simple  okay  okay duly noted  what does that mean  does that mean yes because i really need a yes here ted  all right skyler ill tell you what it means  it means in the most respectful way possible  theres the door  and im inviting you to you know  and thank you for your concern  but im done talking about this  clicks pen  writing  from whom exactly do you think you got that 600000 ted  greataunt birgit  that was you  ja  water trickling  sighs  what is this shit  what i dont get a vote  im supposed to just stay down here forever  i promise you this  either were all
