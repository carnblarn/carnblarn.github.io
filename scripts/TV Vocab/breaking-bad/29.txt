all right so when do we get him walking again  marie its important that we manage our expectations  were talking about months of very hard work  and even then the odds theyre not great  but you cant know for sure   no  when does he start physical therapy  weve sent the paperwork to your insurance  its highpriority we should have preauthorisation in the next few days  certainly by early next week  next week  no thats not gonna do it  ive looked into this  and the sooner physical therapy begins the better his chances are  he needs daily sessions isnt that right   well  actually  your plans treatment programme covers four sessions a week  actually she asked the doctor  planwise four treatments a week is fairly typical  and the therapists in your network are mostly fine  mostly fine okay well theres a ringing endorsement  look if hank had more physical therapy with better therapists  wouldnt it be more likely he would walk  its very hard to say marie  is the health plans way medically justifiable sure  is it absolutely optimal  you know screw it  ill make sure he gets what he needs they can reimburse me  mrs schrader i get your frustration really i do  but my best advice is stay in the network dont go out of pocket  physical therapy is just the beginning  were talking nursing care modifications to your home  occupational therapy medical equipment  it could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars  so what  were just supposed to compromise on his care  well if you dont follow the insurance companys procedures  they may never pay you back  ive seen patients and their families go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed  who is the best physical therapist that you know  i can give you some names  but theyre not likely to be on your plan  to hell with the plan  there he is

no thats 17 percent  i heard you say 5 you said it right in front of me  yeah that was for your partner its privileges of seniority and all  but for you its the usual  hey what you hey listen  come on im talking to you about your future here listen to reason  how is your brotherinlaw  hell live  good im glad  walter you seem troubled  how can i help you  i asked to see you in order to clear the air  there are some issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us  and i think its in our best interests to just lay the cards on the table  thats the best way to do business  my brotherinlaw moments before he was attacked  someone called to warn him  i believe that same person was protecting me  those two men the assassins  i believe i was their prime target  but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brotherinlaw  because of this inte ntion  i am alive  and yet i think that this person  was playing a much deeper game  he made that phone call because he wanted a shootout  not a silent assassination  in one stroke he bloodied both sides  set the american and mexican governments against the cartel  and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the southwest  if this man had his own source of product on this side of the border  he would have the market to himself  the rewards would be enormous  were both adults  i cant pretend i dont know that person is you  i want there to be no confusion  i know i owe you my life  and more than that  i respect the strategy  in your position  i would have done the same  one issue which troubles me  i dont know what happens when our threemonth contract ends  what would you like to happen  you know why i do this  i want security for my family  then you have it  three million for three months that was our agreement  extended annually 12 million a year  call it 15  openended  would that be agreeable  part of the reason we talk about what gets us riled up in our daily lives  is to help each other put a finger on what our relapse triggers might be  head off our disease before it comes back  so anyone  free licence to bitch and moan how often do you get that  jesse last time you seemed down about your job at the laundromat  let me ask something if you had the chance to do anything you wanted  what would you do  make more green man a lot more  forget about money assume you have all you want  i dont know  i guess i would make something  like what  i dont know if it even matters  but work with my hands i guess  building things like carpentry or bricklaying or something  i took this votech class in high school woodworking  i took a lot of votech classes because it was just a big jerkoff  but this one time i had this teacher by the name of  mr pike  i guess he was like a marine or something before he got old  he was hard of hearing  my project for his class  was to make this wooden box  you know like a small  just like a like a box you know to put stuff in  so i wanted to get the thing done as fast as possible  i figured i could cut classes for the rest of the semester  and he couldnt flunk me as long as i you know made the thing  so i finished it in a couple days  and it looked pretty lame but it worked  you know for putting stuff in or whatnot  so when i showed it to mr pike  for my grade  he looked at it and said  is that the best you can do  at first i thought to myself hell yeah bitch  now give me a d and shut up so i can go blaze one with my boys  i dont know maybe it was the way he said it but  it was like he wasnt exactly saying it sucked  he was just asking me honestly is that all you got  and for some reason i thought to myself  yeah man i can do better so i started from scratch  i made another then another  and by the end of the semester by like box number five  i had built this thing  you should have seen it it was insane  i mean i built it out of peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood  it was fitted with pegs no screws  i sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass  then i rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark  it even smelled good  you know you put nose in it and breathed in it was  it was perfect  what happened to the box  i gave it to my mom  nice  you know what im gonna say dont you  its never too late  they have art coops that offer classes  adult extension programme at the university  you know i didnt give the box to my mom  i traded it for an ounce of weed  hes a hero you dont deny coverage to a hero  theyll say theyre not denying coverage  no no im agreeing with you  but i went through all this with walt  youll burn through your savings and then what  well you two managed right  you said yourself  that elliot and gretchens money didnt cover everything   jesus i gotta get back  what no  no no no you should rest  look why dont you go in and take a long bath   i put some fresh sheets on the bed  i wanna be there in case he wakes up  with all theyre giving him hell sleep till morning   hey sky  hey   what

it and they will run with it  because he is a hero and he is not going to be in a wheelchair at 43  jesus  listen marie  i know skylers already told you this  but if theres ever anything that you need anything at all  its good to have you here  both of you  i just wish there was something more that we could do  walt  we can always pay their bills  please its tens of thousands of dollars  we have the money more than enough walt earned it   skyler  i think marie should know the truth  skyler i really dont think this is a good idea   i think that  he earned it gambling  walt and i  weve had our problems lately you know that  and what it all came down to really  was money  pure and simple  when walt was diagnosed  it changed him  and looking back i dont think i ever really understood  what it was that he was going through  it was more than facing death  it was knowing that he was gonna leave behind  nothing  and so thats how this all started for better or worse  he wanted to provide  and so he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how  i thought that elliot and gretchen paid for your treatment  yeah i thought so too  the truth is he never took their money not a dime  he was too proud to take what he considered to be charity  isnt that right  so he put his mind to it and  well you know how walt is  hes a problemsolver  and he read books and he did a whole bunch of research  and he came up with this system  a system  a system for counting cards in blackjack  what do you mean like rain man  well i dont pretend to understand you know all the details  but he was convinced that if he put enough money into it hed have a  god what is it  a statistical edge  yes statistical   so  yeah  so he every spare minute walt was at some card table somewhere  and at first he went to the casinos but then he realised that  but then he realised that the casinos report your winnings to the irs  and if it gets reported your family might find out  if you do not want your family to find out you find another place to gamble  like an illegal backroom game  you remember all those long walks that walt used to take  all that time he used to spend away from home  i guess for a couple months there  you were sort of leading a double life werent you  oh my god  oh my god your fugue state   was that some sort of cover  no no  he did not fake that marie  the night that walt disappeared  he lost 14000  it was his pension fund our savings  basically every last dime we had to our name gone  he couldnt live with it  he was suicidal  but you have to understand that as soon as he got out of the hospital  he went right back to gambling i mean thats how deep this went  how could you do that to her walt  anyway this system of his  he finally got it to work  so all this is to say we have the money  no more gambling  but we have the money  how much money  walt  well  its into seven figures  holy mary mother of god  what can i say  i did very well  marie  you will take our money  use it to take care of hank  please marie let us help   does walt jr know about this  absolutely not  and i need to keep it that way  and hank okay hanks got enough on his mind right now   can we please keep this between us  yeah yeah i  yeah i just i need to  yeah okay well talk about it later  how did you come up with that  i mean where did you possibly  i learned from the best  somehow  something tells me that hank is here because of you  and im not forgetting that
