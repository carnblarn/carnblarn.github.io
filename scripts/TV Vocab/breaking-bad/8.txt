smart right  do that do that thing  no theres theres nothing   breathe into his mouth  no they dont teach that anymore   it doesnt work  you come here  breathe into his mouth  get rid of him  we cant do him like that man  buzzards and rats and all that  im just saying you know its not very christian  it sounds like arguing  gonzo hurry up  whats the big hurry  i just think were done here  youre done  hey im back here  hello  didnt you hear me  hey yourself  what you cant answer when im calling you  are you okay  great  new hat  i got some grilled chicken at albertsons  you want me to heat some up for you  whereve you been  do you know what ive got all this crap on my face  let me clean up first okay  you know walter juniors gonna be home any minute so  enough  hold up  stop it  stop it  i know youre scared  and youre angry and youre frustrated and i know none of this is fair  but you cannot  take it out on me  hey im home  we are dead  dead man  muerto ormuerte however the hell you   this is conjecture  this is conjecture   yes and conjecture isnt helping  my conjecture isnt helping fine  facts then fact a  my phone rang like eight times last night dead air hang ups every time  second fact  of his cruising my neighborhood  if he wanted to kill us   he wouldve done it at the junkyard  what is that conjecture  are you basing that on that hes got a normal  healthy brain or something  did you not see him beat a dude to death for like nothing  and that way that way he just kept staring at us  saying  youre done  youre done  you wanna know what that means i will tell you what that means  that means exactly how it sounds yo  all right we are witnesses we are loose ends  right now tucos thinking yeah hey  they cook good meth but can i trust them  what happens when he decides no  its him or us you understand it is him or us  how would you do it   what do you mean  specifically  how would you do it step by step  all right  say we  set up one last sale this is providing  he doesnt decide to waste us before then  every time we bring in a new batch he always  tests the product right so  as his head is down you know just giving it a snort  so three shots   three shots or i dont know two  but is it two or is it three   two would probably work i guess  two shots in the chest   or in the face  come on  im just trying to understand how this works  all right well put a pin in that but by now  the big guy gonzo hes probably coming at you right  so you turn toward him how many shots for him  hes a big guy right how many shots does that take   i dont know three shots  okay three shots  tuco and gonzo two men down now is there anyone else there  i mean tuco is usually with someone else right  maybe even a couple of guys his dealers his posse  all right  so well put a pin in that one too  now at this point how many shots have been fired  youve gotta be running low how many bullets does that gun take  how can you suggest  that we kill a man and you cant even open the gun  its not that easy is it  hey man walt you did it  call skyler  hey there youve reached walt skyler and walter junior  we cant come to the phone right now so please leave us a

oldtimers i know are either dead or in prison  pseudos in short supply  so these two make do by changing up the formula  that and the thermite  id say these two know their chemistry  but ranking them as burglars  shit i wouldnt trust these two to break into the special olympics  they got book learnin but no street skills  maybe theyre college kids  chem students trying to make a big score  maybe  i tell you  that big a score theyre gonna wind up stepping on some toes  tell you what  they better pray its us who catches up to them and not those boys from jurez  your daughter wants out  hey there  youve reached walt skyler and walter junior  we cant come to the phone right now  so please leave us a message  hey its me  i thought id try you earlier this time  before you go out and you know  face the day  im realizing now  it probably takes you a little longer to get to the phone  owing to the extra baby weight  hey sweetie  walt did you spend the entire night out here  no no well not all of it  oh yeah i did have a touch of  my stomach you know  i knew i was gonna be up and down so i just didnt want to wake you  how would he know where i live   youre sure it was tuco  who else could it be  did you ever tell him my name where i live or anything  what about gonzo or the dead one   did you tell them anything about me  i didnt say jack  tuco mustve put out like you know feelers  hes got his ways and means yo  sources all right hes closing in  and what happens when he finds out that my brotherinlaw is a dea agent  oh god what happens then  look its got five bullets  i finally figured out how to  look i just finally i figured it out  say we get a second gun right for you  i mean dont we like  double our chances  i mean mathematically  ive got a better idea  thank god  all right  what is it mr white lay it on me  beans  beans  theyre castor beans  so what are we gonna do with them  are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk huh  climb it and escape  we are going to process them into ricin  rice and beans  ricin  its an extremely effective poison  its toxic in small doses  also fairly easy to overlook during an autopsy  all right   so  dont touch them  wait seriously you can get poison from beans  back in the late70s  ricin was used to assassinate a bulgarian journalist  the kgb modified the tip of an umbrella  to inject a tiny pellet into the mans leg  and were talking about an amount not much bigger than the head of a pin  but it killed him  now we just need to figure out a delivery device  and then  no more tuco  how you doing  is this this a bad time  no come on in  i shouldve called first im sorry  what can i do for you  maybe we ought  you want to sit down first  i dont know hank  depends on whether or not this is gonna be about marie  did she send you  hell no  shes barely even talking to me  thats why im here okay  selfpreservation  big time  look  i know you gals have your ups and downs   i get it  gals  and i need to get involved  like i need a second hole in my ass  but if you could do me this huge favor and just return her phone calls  i dont  think im quite ready to do that yet  you know communication communication right  the back the forth come on  sky do this for me please  you can yell at her  just call her back  marie is a shoplifter hank  thats right  that baby tiara she gave me at the shower  she stole it from gertrude zacharys  i almost got arrested when i went back to return it  and marie wont admit it  she wont apologize  yeah if i thought you were gonna return it i would have never  you know  you knew about this  were working on it  i mean shes got this therapist dave   i mean dave is really good  daves good  but its an ongoing process sky  and we have gotta be understanding  you know i mean weve gotta you know weve gotta  support the shit out of her  do we  i need support  me  the almost 40yearold pregnant woman  with the surprise baby on the way  and the husband with the lung cancer  who disappears for hours on end and i dont know where he goes  and he barely even speaks to me anymore  with the moody son who does the same thing  and the overdrawn checking account  and the lukewarm water heater that leaks rustylooking crap  and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet  and we cant even afford to fix it  but oh i see  now im supposed to go hank please  what can i possibly do to further benefit  my spoiled kleptomaniac bitch sister  who somehow always manages to be the center of attention  cause god knows shes the one  with the really important problems  want me to take a look at that utility closet  thats all it takes  thats all it takes  so now what  now we arrange our next meet  in a public place this time nice and safe  business as usual  and uh after we sell him our usual four pounds  then well pull this out  by the way tuco  the new meth formula weve been working on  would you care to try it  okay well whats new about it  just in case he asks what do we say  i dont know whatever you want  it gets the user insanely high  i mean how much salesmanship do we really need  that degenerate snorts anything he gets his hands on  okay well well just put a pin in that then  anyway within the next 48 hours  maybe 72  itll look like natural causes  what like a heart attack  or the flu maybe  his associates wont know any differently  and well be in the clear  not if tuco kills us first  just keep it down  hey hank whats up  hey buddy  you been home yet  why  well  cause i really screwed up  i apologize in advance for the earful youre gonna hear from skyler  im just trying to get her and marie talking again  big mistake i should have just kept out of it  yeah well okay  me and my big mouth i guess  well that happens  its no problem no worries  well thanks
