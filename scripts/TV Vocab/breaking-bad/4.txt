it all  nonsmall cell adenocarcinoma  stage 3a  which means its spread from the lung to the lymph nodes  theres no denying its very serious  but is it  it is  curable  i prefer the word treatable  but the treatments we have at our disposal can be very effective  without making any promises i can tell you that  the specific course of radiation and chemotherapy im going to suggest  has been successful  in certain cases it prolonged patients lives and even resulted in remission  what about the side effects  well they can be mild to practically nonexistent  or they can be pretty darn awful  it varies from patient to patient  typically theres hair loss  which begins a couple of weeks after the start of chemotherapy  you may find yourself unusually fatigued not much energy  you wont want to get out of bed  you may lose weight due to reduced appetite and certain intestinal issues  muscle aches and pains gums get sore and bleed  and of course theres the possibility of nausea  although well prescribe an antiemetic and try to counteract that  possible kidney or bladder irritation  you may wind up with increased bruising and bleeding  there may be sexual side effects  your skin may become dry and irritated  got anything to say  what do you know about that   nothing  thats not going to fly this time  how many chances have we given you  how many times have we sat right here  and had the same conversation over and over again  where you look us in the eye and you plead ignorance  and you play on our emotions  and you tell us anything you think we want to hear  just so well give you another chance  and it makes us feel like fools every time  enough jesse  enough  we are not going to have this in our house  we need you to leave  thanks for not telling on me  you think i could have it back  its skunk weed anyway  you know this is actually very hopeful  did you hear me  i said this is really very very hopeful  can i call them and tell them youll start next week  i just think that we need to  discuss it a little more thats all  what is there to discuss  youre going to get the best treatment  and hes the best  well theres the money discussion  90000 out of pocket   maybe more  theres a way walt  theres financing theres installment plans  i could always go back to work  walt theres always a way  all right  skyler say that there is a way  and we spend all that money and  am i supposed to leave you with all that debt  i just dont want emotions ruling us  maybe treatment isnt the way to go  then why dont you just fucking die already  just give up and die  come on move your ass  what do i care  yeah im not worried i have the best fucking attorney  i would not want to be on the other side of this one  what the hell  what are you doing call somebody call the fire people  i dont believe it you know how much i paid for that  why is it doing this
