uhhuh  now that were all together here are the ground rules  division of labor i handle the business  making the stuff thats your end  i dont tell you how to mix  your chemicals and whatnot  and you do not tell me  how to take care of business  is that absolutely clear  sure  all right lets take the tour  hey youre okay with that  yes  he handles the business  and i handle him  clearly were talking about renting not buying  you need an ongoing business  someplace you can slide in do your thing  and remain anonymous  im not gonna mince words  this is your best bet  got machines running  forklifts people coming and going  youre gonna stay way under the radar  and the owners solid  he cant wait to throw up a curtain wall  stack some boxes in front of it give you all the space you need  after that hes got his business youve got yours  and never the twain shall meet  its outstanding am i right  machines like this gotta be plenty of power  what about the smell  ah more good news  ive been here when its up and running  this place stinks already youll blend right in  how many employees  ha i knew youd ask  sixteen illegals  all highly motivated to stay deaf blind and dumb  youll want to vet them im sure  yes indeed  so what do you say maestro  huh is it unanimous  you know i worked in a box factory one summer in high school  i havent seen one of these in years  trip down memory lane thats perfect  you know what this is  its a corrugator  it uses steam and salt  to crimp kraft paper for cardboard  and it makes a hell of  doing it which is great right  no  steam and salt  when this thing is running its like a jungle in here  shit itll ruin the product  well you cant just hop down to costco  and get a couple dehumidifiers  what fine fine moving on  spacious isolated location  no humidity  and you get all the free tortillas you want  thats the special feature of this place  yeah i dont know  itll make the tortillas smell like cat piss  somebodys bound to notice that  all right well theres gotta be some kind of workaround right  its a technical problem you guys are technical guys  you know be creative put your heads together  anything foodrelated  is gonna have unannounced government inspections  all im asking is that you keep an open mind  dennis already set some spaces behind these keepball games  no  hell no  i know its a long shot  all i can say to recommend this one  is were talking about an owner here who is  how should i put it highly amenable  okay i get it just say no and well go get dinner  all right so ill start  no way were cooking in here  no space nowhere for the smell to go  look at that door  that thing rolls up and were open to the world  i dont know if anybody noticed  but theres a cop shop a quarter of a mile away  the hammer comes down  its gonna be custers last stand  its perfect  what  how are we gonna fit a lab in here  who said here  a house is infested  termites cockroaches whatever  homeowners hire a pest control company  truck rolls up homeowners leave  the crew tents the house  they bomb the place with poison  the house stays like that for days  no one looks twice at a tented house  now maybe theres a strange smell coming out of it  does someone think to investigate no  anyone go inside hell no  and thats where well cook  they tent what three four houses a week  so we pick the one thats best for us  enough floor space easy access  once the tent is up  we go in we cook a batch  we bomb the place and leave  so we gotta move in and out for every cook  set up the lab cook and then take everything down  its challenging but doable  tell me about these guys  uh mr ponytail on the sidewalk thats ira  hes the owner on the roof is sandor  the ladders fernando  and down below thats todd  the pest control operation is legit  i mean theyre licensed theyre bonded  they do as good a job as anyone in town  but theyre also topdrawer secondstory men  secondstory  be artists  theyre burglars  yeah i mean hey they play it smart  they dont boost anything while theyre on the job  they copy the keys locate the valuables and alarms  and they sell that information to other crews  or after a decent interval  theyll come back and live for goods themselves  and you know them how  oh ive been pulling their chestnuts out of the fire  legally speaking for five years  ira and his guys are good  i mean they know how to keep their mouths shut  and if you buy them theyre gonna stay bought  you can check into them yourself  i will if it comes to that  so do we take a vote  why  we sound great rock on man  solid  that yamahas got a real nice touch  you like the sound its huge huh  yeah its real nice but were looking for something else today  you got any roadie cases   for sure what size  biggest you got  thatll fit through like a regularsize doorway  you got it follow me  top of the line  recessed hardware foam lining  walls  threeinch casters  height is good width is good  how much weight will this hold  its rated for 900 pounds  so unless your band plays lead bricks you should be okay  were gonna need uh  hey man im trying to do business over here bitch  sorry hes like overly enthusiastic  anyway um im gonna need four of them  four that gonna be layaway  i need to see a bunch of ids for that  no man cash  okay hey uh you know what  ill throw in stenciling whats your band called  damn brother  not asking no questions but it sure looks like youre back in business  no joke you way back in business man   look at this  yeah  oh youre stacking the benjies   till the rubber band pops  yeah yeah  alls were saying is we know youre major league now  but if theres ever anything else you need from us  any way we can get in on this at all  little stuff big stuff  we would be all over it  you know uh maybe someday  thats cool  i guess we better hit it then  yeah keep on keeping on brother  later  okay it is the same job as always  you go out you inspect  you deal with the customers regular drill  everythings the same  except for one important detail   no stealing  no stealing  not a toothpick not the spare change between the couch cushions  not the panties out of the hamper  nothing and i mean nothing  and if youre out with your buddies  and they ask if you got a hot tip on a be  you tell them you got nada  youre out of the game the bottom line is  that these houses are out of bounds now and forever  got it  all right  from time to time youre gonna see these two  now as far as youre concerned they are ghosts  you dont see them you dont hear them  you dont say good morning  you dont speak unless youre spoken to  on the other hand  if they tell you to jump  you dont ask what for  you jump  now you need a name for them  you call them yes sir and no sir  you got any problems you come to me  heres the deal  the finishing tanks a tight fit  and with this motor youve got here on top  the agitation motor  the agitation motor here on top  the tanks not gonna fit in the box  its just uh its just too tall  now i thought wed put a collar on the tank  and carry the motor in separately  alongside the condenser  and on the day we just kind of  twist it into place  you know while were setting up   yeah  yeah   thats good  yeah  that will work  and joe and his guys can build it right  yeah you know theyre uh theyre up for it  joe already bought a tig welder for the aluminum work  and you know  i figure if they can pull off the magnet  they can handle this  now listen about the smell  about keeping it out of peoples drapes and furniture and whatnot  when i was down in mexico they uh  there was this big big plastic hospital tent  they set up inside of the  oh shit sorry  oh hi sorry  no no no we were just uh wrapping up  um this is my uh  friend

larvae  as well as the fullgrown blattodea so we have all your keys  any extras on here you might wind up needing   no im good  okay  this last one here acknowledges that you have been informed  that

everything weve been through  the two of us  this has to be your decision  i mean youve earned that  seriously  yeah  secrets create barriers  between people  im speaking from experience believe me  all that youve done  its a part of you and  i mean if you choose to spend the rest of your life with this person  then youll have to decide  how much youll share with her  meaning what like everything  like gale  im just trying to say that i trust you  and i know youll make the right call  if she loves you  shell understand  theyre leaving streaks  this more ethniclooking one hes doing a great job  but the other one is going back and forth  like hes scrubbing a wall  they have to go in circles  or youre going to leave streaks  thats pretty basic right  uh i dont mean to tell you your business

take the product from us to the dealers  and so transportation is worth 20  they are taking a risk  275000 worth of risk  wow  what did gus pay his mules  gustavo fring didnt use mules  he didnt need them  he spent 20 years building his own distribution  he had 16 refrigerator trucks running his product  and you know where they are now  government impound  you dont like paying 20 maybe you shouldnt have killed the guy  hey hey hey  theres still over a million bucks here all right  thats for one cook  and since youre putting on the green eyeshade  my supplier and i came to an agreement  the methylamine was free this time  but brace yourself  because the next barrel is gonna cost big  can we continue or you got anymore burning questions  okay kid  you fronted us 120000 to get us going  so thats 40000 from him and me  yes thank you jesse  okay  now ira gets 110000 for our piece of the business  and 25000 per cook  that is 45000  from each of us  iras guys get  goodmans cut  legacy cost  351000  thats 117000 each  legacy cost  i got nine guys  you dont know them but they were part of the previous operation  and they know a lot  and right now some of them are in jail  and more will be soon  the feds ricoed their hazard pay  so we are gonna make em whole  we are gonna make them whole  what is this we  these were guss employees not ours  they might have been guss employees  but theyre my guys  so what are they doing to further our interests  the cops are looking at them very closely  we dont want them furthering our interests  so we are paying them why  because its what you do  ohh  its what you do  my guys are keeping their mouths shut  we make em whole  one hand washes the other its as simple as that  huh  it sounds like a simple shakedown  simple as that  were paying for their silence  thats blackmail  business is my end  this is business end of story  this is your problem  it should come out of your end  hey hey just take it out of mine  all right go for it  i dont care just take it  no  jesse thank you  but no  ill pay my share  go ahead  let me tell you something  this  is how its gonna be  from here on out  my guys are ongoing expenditure  so you best get yourself comfortable with it   thats less than with fring  listen walter  just because you shot jesse james  dont make you jesse james  tomorrow  so how are you feeling  okay i guess  broke it off with andrea  i had to  shes gonna tell brock  im still gonna take care of the rent and stuff  its the right thing to do but you know  i meant this  how are you feeling about the money  youre looking at it wrong  when we worked for gus  we were cooking  this last batch was great  but we didnt even crack 50 pounds  we maybe cleared less money but we got a bigger piece of the pie  its like you said now were owners  not employees  ive been thinking about victor  yeah  yeah all this time  i was sure that gus did what he did  to send me a message  maybe theres another reason  like what  victor trying to cook that batch on his own  taking liberties that werent his to take  maybe he flew too close to the sun  got his throat cut
