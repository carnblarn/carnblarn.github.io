                youre traveling through another dimension a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination thats the signpost up ahead your next stop the twilight zone thank you william yes sir cut whats your point that if it were possible for a person to go back in time thered be nothing in the world to prevent them from altering the course of history is that it thats right lets say corrigan that you go back in time its october 1929 the day before the stock market crashed now you know that on the following morning securities are going to tumble into an abyss now using this prior knowledge theres a hundred things you could do to protect yourself but id be an anachronism i really dont belong back there you could sell out the day before the crash but what if i did and started the crash earlier now history tells us that on october 24 1929 the bottom fell out of the stock market thats a fixed date it exists as an event in the history of our times it cant be altered and i say it can now whats to prevent me say from going to a broker on the morning of october 23 or 22 witness a theoretical argument washington dc the present four intelligent men talking about an improbable thing like going back in time a friendly debate revolving around a simple issue could a human being change what has happened before interesting and theoretical because who ever heard of a man going back in time before tonight that is because this is the twilight zone gentlemen im afraid im going to have to leave time travel to hg wells im much too tired to go into any more metaphysics this evening and since no one has ever gone back into time i find the whole blame subject much too theoretical anyway phil ill probably see you over the weekend dont get lost back in time now corrigan i certainly shall not good night gentlemen good night pete so long corrigan well where do we get a fourth good evening im desperately sorry mr

section now if theres nothing else do you have a room yes i have rooms for acceptable boarders do you come from around here yes i do army veteran yes yes as a matter of fact i am may i inquire as to what business youre in im an engineer oh really a professional man well right upstairs and to the right good evening mrs landers good evening off to the play yes dinner and then off to the play well enjoy yourselves applaud the president for me well certainly do that good night have a good time what did you say well what did i say to the officer you said something to him she just said something to you about the president she told me to applaud him where might your sympathies lie yes young man which army were you in well i was in the army of the republic of course well then why make such a thing of applauding president lincoln its his due we figure that and everything else god bless him youre going to a play tonight we may or may not depending on when my husband makes up his mind to call a carriage to get us to the theater and to dinner what theater what play well fords theater of course fords theater are you all right are you feeling all right whats the name of the play i beg your pardon the play the one youre going to tonight at fords theater whats it called its calledour american cousin our american cousin and lincolns going to be there and its april 14 1865 isnt it really sir id call these actions most strange itisapril 14 1865 let me in let me in the presidents going to be shot tonight let me in now what has this one done while you idiots are sitting here youre going to lose a president thats what hes been yelling all the way over to the station and thats why the doorman at fords theater popped him on the head he tried to pound his way right through the stage door yelling some sort of nonsense about president lincolns going to be shot president lincoln will be shot tonight at the theater a man named booth and how would you be knowing this are you some kind of a clairvoyant or something i only know what i know if i told you how i knew you wouldnt believe me look keep me here if you like lock me up but hear me out let him sleep it off somebody better get to the presidents box at the theater keep him out of there put a cordon of men around him a man named john wilkes booth is going to assassinate him tonight wellington sergeant jonathan wellington well and what can we do for you mr wellington that man you just had incarcerated mr corrigan i believe you said his name was drunk sir thats probably what he is drunk or or perhaps ill i wonder if he might be remanded in my custody he might well be a war veteran i would hate to see him placed in jail you say you want us to remand him in your custody precisely ill be fully responsible for him i think perhaps i might be able to help him all right sir if thats the way youd like it have corrigan brought back in here this gentleman is going to look out for him thats real decent of you sir real decent of you ill be outside have him brought out to me if you would i will indeed sir yes uh about that corrigan sir what about him well wouldnt it be wise sir if if what he seemed so positive sir so sure about the president i mean and what should we do send all available police to fords theater and on what authority on the word of some demented fool who probably left his mind in gettysburg if i were you mister id be considerably more thoughtful in sizing up a situation or youll not advance in the next now be good enough to step aside so i can get on with my work sergeant it wouldnt hurt if it wouldnt hurt if what well i only meant to suggest sir that if perhaps we placed an extra guard in the box with the president the president has enough guards the whole federal army is at his disposal and if theyre satisfied with the arrangements for his protection so am i so should you here try this itll make you feel better better who are you anyway at the moment im your benefactor apparently your only friend im in the government service but as a young man in college i dabbled in medicine of a sort medicine medicine of the mind psychiatrist dont know the term what

here in washington the night of lincolns assassination he went all over town trying to warn people that something might happen how he figured it out nobody seems to know its certainly not recorded anyplace but there was so much publicity about it that people never forgot him he became chief of police then a councilman did some wheeling and dealing in land and became a millionaire well gentlemen

from a place back there a journey into time with highly questionable results proving on one hand that the threads of history are woven tightly and the skein of events cannot be undone but on the other hand there are small fragments of tapestry that can be altered tonights thesis to be taken as you will in the twilight zone rod serling creator ofthe twilight zone will tell you about next weeks story
