                 male presenter off there is a fifth dimension beyond that whichis known to man it is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity it is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition and it lies between the pit of mans fears and the summit of his knowledge this is the dimension of imagination it is an area which we call the twilight zone youre about to meet a hypochondriac witness mr walter bedeker age 44 afraid of the following death disease other people germs draft and everything else he has one interest in life and thats walter bedeker one preoccupation the life and wellbeing of walter bedeker one abiding concern about society that if walter bedeker should die how will it survive without him well doctor i asked you a question how bad is it oh it isnt bad at all its quite good you have no temperature pressure normal respiration normal heart action normal no infection throat clear nasal passages clear ears clear what about the pains in my back and side what about four sleepless nights in a row what about that that mr bedeker is psychosomatic psycho you mean that im sick only in my m ind that is my considered opinion mr bedeker theres nothing wrong with you except these ailments you manufacture for yourself your pains are imaginary your inability to sleep is a case of nerves nothing more in short mr bedeker youre a very healthy man you see thats a doctor four years premed four years medical school two years internship two years residency and what is he i ask you what is he a quack  doctor how is he oh dont ask him the mans an idiot walter dont excite yourself please then stop whispering theres half my trouble this woman goes around whispering making me think im sick even when im not and i am im on the threshold of death and who is ushering me out a quack and a whispering woman ill call tomorrow dont bother just come over with the death certificate you can sign it here oh walter oh stop those crocodile tears shed love to see me gone i cant tell you well goodbye mr bedeker take good care of yourself oh thank you doctor doctor how is he really mrs bedeker your husband is one of the healthiest patients i have ethel but hes sick most of the time well ill call again mrs bedeker it wouldnt be a bad idea if you took a few vitam ins yourself you look a little run down and pale walter ethel theres a draft in here and i feel a cold coming on yes dear ill ill be right there all right take a few of those im sure youll feel much better thank you dont worry see you goodbye doctor  walter freezing air blasting into the room you know how many germs there are in a cubic foot of air ethel both i know you want me to die thats why you leave windows open but as a point of decency couldnt you do it more subtly the doctor said it was stuffy you need fresh air what have you got there im well but he gives you prescriptions for me he says im not sick but while i lie here helpless he tells you ive got a life expectancy of 20 m inutes dont deny it ethel i could smell the collusion it was for vitam ins walter for me vitam ins for you here i lie with my life ebbing away and that quack prescribes vitam ins for you see im dying but she gets vitam ins stop ethel get out of here let me die in peace all right walter what i simply meant that id let you alone so you can take a little nap i cant nap why does a man have to die i asked you a question why does a man have to die the world goes on for m illions of years and how long is a mans life this much a drop a m icroscopic fragment why cant a man live 500 years or a thousand why does he have to die almost the moment hes born i dont know dear of course you wouldnt go on get out of here ethel mm  oh its a crime for a man to live such a short span of years why cant a man live a decent number of years male why not 500 600 yes or a thousand what a miserable thing to contemplate  a handful of years then an eternity under the ground in a casket in the cold cold ground with worms yet yes of course with worms i subscribe to your views wholly mr bedeker i mean wholly thats m ighty decent of you who are you cadwalladers my name at least its the name im using this month it has a nice feeling on the tongue cadwallader howd you get in here ive never been gone ive been here for some time ill make it brief mr bedeker you look like a man with a nose for a bargain so id like to make you a proposition we each have something the other wants that seems a relatively solid basis for a bargain does it and what do you have that could possibly interest me a great many things oh youd be surprised mr bedeker many things varied and delightful and what do i have that could remotely interest you actually a m inor item in fact something less than m inor insignificant infinitesimal m icroscopic teensyweensy what did you say your name was whats in a name mr bedeker really its a mere question of semantics just language a mere stretch of words for example what is it you want you want an extended lifespan a few hundred years to play around with some people would call that immortality but why make it sound so imposing lets call it just the two of us lets call it some additional free time after all what are a few hundred years or a few thousand a few thousand what is it in the scheme of things the world will go on ad infinitum so what are a few thousand years more or less give or take add or subtract and this little item that you want in return what do we call that well what could we call that we could call it uh a little piece of your makeup a crumb off the crust of your structure a fragment of an atom of your being or or what a soul youre the devil at your service  how about it mr bedeker why not a partnership of a sort you deed to me your socalled soul and in exchange i give you immortality and then indestructibility complete indestructibility nothing can hurt you nothing can hurt me and i live forever certainly why not forever governments and institutions may disintegrate people die but walter bedeker goes on and on  walter bedeker goes on and on mr cadwallader about my soul you say i wont miss it youll never know its gone no tricks no hidden clauses ill just live as long as i want to live is that it that is it that is precisely it what about my appearance im afraid i cant do much about that what i mean is you should look practically the same well after 500 years i dont want to look like a driedup old prune oh mr bedeker you drive a mean bargain a most difficult bargain but ill show you im a cooperative chap ill throw this into the deal whatever aging takes place on your features will be more or less imperceptible well mr cadwallader i think were close to making a deal youll never regret this not to your dying day which by rights should not be for several thousand years yet however there is one thing  now it comes out good day mr cadwallader oh its for your benefit i assure you ah article 93 yes here it is well its in the nature of an escape clause your escape clause whereas the party of the first part upon due notification of the party well ill just give it to you thumbnail its simply that if you ever get tired of living mr bedeker you exercise this escape clause by calling upon me to furnish your well there go those terms again to furnish your dem ise at which point i shall see to it that you are given a rapid and uncomplicated uh departure and let me assure you that im not the sort of fellow to kill the goose that lays the golden egg when you talk of immortality to me brother i mean immorrality  youre going to have a long long long wait mr bedeker nothing could please me more then mr cadwallader your pen please  whew you sure keep it hot in here   there everything seems to be in order   ah walter ethel behold the new walter bedeker    female hes alive somebody should get an ambulance male is he all right another male its a miracle you all right

about it i mean there aspirins rubbing alcohol ethel walter have we got any ammonia ammonia thats what i said ammonia walter  nothing ive just drunk enough to kill 1 2 men and it tastes like lemonade to me weak lemonade walter what what is this all about would youreally like to know yes i am immortal im indestructible i have made a pact with a man named cadwallader he has given me immortality in exchange for my soul more simple than that i couldnt put it ill call a doctor you will not if you had any imagination at all youd find a way for me to get some excitement out of all this ive been in
