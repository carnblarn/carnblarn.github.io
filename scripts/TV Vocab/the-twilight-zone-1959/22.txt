                 male narrator there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man it is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity it is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition and it lies between the pit of mans fears and the summit of his knowledge this is the dimension of imagination it is an area which we call the twilight zone maple street usa late summer a treelined little world of frontporch gliders barbecues the laughter of children and the bell of an icecream vendor at the sound of the roar and the flash of light it

maple streets and well go from one to the other and let th em destroy themselves one to the oth er one to the oth er one to the oth er narrator the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the m inds of men for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own for the children and the children yet unborn and the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to the twilight zone
