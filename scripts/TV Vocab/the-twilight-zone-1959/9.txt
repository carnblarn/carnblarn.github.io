only way i can stay awake stand on your head if you think it will help whats funny you are are you sure youre a psychiatrist why do you ask i expected something different like an old man with a white beard and a german accent maybe i know thats what everybody expects and theyre always disappointed you know ive often thought of wearing a disguise yeah now feel more comfortable look doctor you cant help me im just wasting your time youre sure of that yeah then whyd you come to me it was fred jacksons idea my regular doctor i know he called me what did he say not much your name edward hall age 35 occupation draftsman single heart condition no history of mental diseases thats it are you going to tell me the rest  no no forget it okay mr hall do youreally think running away will do you any good now dont get me wrong sometimes running away is the best answer but i dont know that yours is that sort of problem maybe it is maybe it isnt you do what you like you promise you wont put me in a straitjacket i dont promise anything okay okay it doesnt make any difference  can i open this quite a drop uh mr hall ill uh ill have to close the window i only wanted some air well ill uh turn the conditioner up it works best with the windows closed did you think id jump you m ight have not a chance i want to live thats my problem oh all right mr hall suppose you tell me all about it everything start anywhere okay but im warning you youre gonna think i lost my marbles no marbles can be found mr hall go on did you ever look at this picture i mean really look at it doctor i think so why has it ever moved no not to my knowledge anyway i can make it move can you yes but not really when i was a kid we had a picture like this in our house not the same thing exactly but pretty close a boat hall my mother used to tell me to look at it she said if i looked at it long enough it would move all i had to do was keep looking at it i didnt believe her but the idea fascinated me one night i spent a whole hour just staring at that silly boat and did it move yes now you understand theres nothing strange about that it was an optical illusion yeah i know except that after a while i couldnt control it every time i looked at that boat the sails would fill and they would begin to dip i just couldnt stop it imagination is strong in a growing boy yeah i realize that i realized it even then but the point is i got just as scared as if it were really happening the m ind is everything if you think youve got a pain in your arm and theres no physical reason for it it hurts just the same doesnt it granted is that how you manage to stay awake how else how many grains a day i dont know i havent got much longer anyway you want to hear the rest or not yes when i was 1 5 i developed a rheumatic heart they said id never really get well that id have to take it easy no strenuous exercise no long walks no stairs no shocks avoid any kind of shock they said they forgot about my imagination three years ago a woman was killed by a man who was hidden in the backseat of her car you may have read about it i did anyway it started me thinking maybe somebody was hiding in the backseat of my car maybe one night driving over laurel canyon id look up in the rearview m irror and id see somebody or something coming up out of the darkness i had to drive the canyon twice a day its a rough road one slip and youre over the edge one night like every other night i headed for home suddenly i felt uncomfortable as if i werent alone in the car it was ridiculous but i couldnt shake the sensation i kept thinking theres somebody back there ill look in the rearview mirror and ill see his face then ill see his hands reaching up heres the important thing doctor i knew intellectually that i was alone but i also knew that my imagination would make me see something if i thought about it long enough    of course there wasnt anyone else in the car it was all in my m ind what difference did that make i crashed anyway i was lucky the shock should have killed me i couldnt survive another one the doctor said i could be sure of that and has there been another one no but there will be just as soon as i fall asleep the girl will be in this dream again and itll be the last shock when i was a kid i used to dream in sequence remember the adventure serials they used to have in movie theaters it was like that every dream was a chapter id always remember because when i woke up id write down what happened its crazy huh not necessarily it could simply be that the dreams conformed to the notes not the other way around then you dont think its possible to dream in episodes i dont say its impossible it isnt believe me for a long time i didnt dream at all then a week ago it started i went to bed at around 1 1 30 i wasnt too tired but i needed the rest because of my heart i dont know when i fell asleep but all of a sudden i wasnt at home anymore i was at an amusement park   hall it was the kind
