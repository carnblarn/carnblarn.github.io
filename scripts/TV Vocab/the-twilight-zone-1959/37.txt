off this front page thats why i thought we ought to have a psychiatrist in on it its very odd i thought so too so i checked with the pentagon in washington on his army background captain air force b25 africa and italy discharged august 1943 recurrent fevers some suggestion of psychological disturbance but he was discharged before they could find out much about it and this was his plane his plane and his crew took off for italy on what was supposed to be a routine flight embry never went on that last mission reported in ill and someone else flew the plane for him never got back and for 17 years hes been carrying that around in his gut youre all right mr embry youre in a hospital well look after you crazy dream i went back i went back to the desert thats all right mr embry no no no sorry mr embry you went back to the desert then what i went back to my plane i was looking for the fellas i looked everywhere for them i saw blake but it was it was a mirage an illusion he wasnt there none of them were there it was an illusion mr embry but youre out of it now youre going to be all right i should have been on the plane i should have gone on that mission i chickened out you didnt chicken out you had no way of knowing that plane wasnt going to come back now you realize it more as time goes by and youll feel better for it its out in the open now you dont have to hide it in a pit deep inside of you thats whats been hurting you all these years another crazy thing uh uh an illusion or a dream or whatever i was out there in the desert and above me in the sky jets isnt that wild african desert and jet planes overhead just as if i just as if i had gone back there today did i did i go back did i go back to my plane in your mind thats how you went back only in your mind only in my mind go back to sleep now mr embry youre going to be all right i think the worst part of it is over at least the guilt is out in the open and he knows what it is that illusion certainly seems real to him in a couple of days a week it will lose all reality doctor these are mr embrys clothes you left them in the examination room put them on the desk here nurse im going back in the room ill take them in id like to talk to him in a day or so fine ill keep a check on him whats that its sand enigma buried in the sand a question mark with broken wings that lies in silent grace as a marker in a desert shrine odd how the real consorts with the shadows how the present fuses with the past how does it happen the question is on file in the silent desert and the answer the answer is waiting for us
