just that it would be different yes it would be different wed walk through the rain and get ourselves sopping wet then wed eat some greasy unpalatable food served off of dirty unwashed plates and after that it would be a moot question whether wed succumb to ptomaine or pneumonia will that be all maam oh just a little bit longer nelda dont make her do that anymore what is the matter with you its just that outside there must be the clean beautiful sound of rain and in here those constant animal grunts of pleasure jana yell at me father please yell at me i cant tell you how delighted i am to hear you yell at me it proves that youve got lungs lungs and a mind and a mouth and a voice oh father were atrophying in here we sit here day after day and year after year while that clock turns

fact please dont stop on my account jana we have no secrets here dont we no secrets is that it father why thats all we do have secrets thats how we live by shutting off the world turning our backs on it while you soundless fleshless things glide around here and with your efficient ministrations turn my father and my mother into jelly if i may say so miss jana you sound jealous you said yourself jana that i designed and built to perfection and i made these people quite indestructible its like living with ghosts oh no my dear not ghosts ghosts are those who have died after living but these people had no life until i gave it to them the residence of dr william loren which is in reality a menagerie for machines were about to discover that sometimes the product of mans talent and genius can walk amongst us untouched by the normal ravages of time these are dr lorens robots built to function as well as artistic perfection but in a moment dr william loren wife and daughter will discover that perfection is relative that even robots have to be paid for and very shortly will be shown exactly what is the bill tonight florient unscented the new kind of room deodorant that kills bad odors yet leaves no fragrance brings you ah i believe ill take the meerschaum tonight robert ill prepare it sir will there be anything else dr loren i think not tonight robert good night sir good night

find youre unhappy youre rebellious do you think that pleases us jana i dont know i explained to you a long time ago why i did what i did why i retired from the world and why i built these people what youve done to yourselves is an atrocity but what youve done to me is worse youve turned me into a freak an unsocial unworldly insulated freak shall i tell you what else ive done for you jana ive kept you from harm ive protected you against disease and insulation in this its a service youve never had to look into the face of war or the face of poverty or prejudice well youve been isolated yes but what you think of as imprisonment just happens to be asylum and security yes and survival asylum in a hothouse security in a mausoleum survival as a vegetable survives what youre becoming and what youre making me become a vegetable thank you yes sir oh now madam theres a good girl will that be all maam yes thank you nelda good night good night maam nelda time is running out father instead of controlling youre being controlled why youre becoming dependent youre both reaching a point where you wont be able to exist without them destroy them father get rid of them dismantle them jana jana theyre not just machines do you know how many thousands of hours ive spent in developing them and perfecting them do you realize how how marvelously intricate they are how scientifically precise not just arms and legs that move jana theyre creatures they have minds and wills they have memory tracks you see ive given each one of them a memory of his own havent i yes and all of them can recount to you in detail everything thats happened to them since their early childhood and they had no childhood they were born just as you see them now werent they yes looking the way they do acting the way they do but each with his own talent one of them was built as a cook another was built as a maid the butler was manufactured as a butler the handyman knows nothing but being a handyman jana youre not asking me to dismantle machines youre asking me to destroy that which has life life theyre just highly complicated toys father youve turned this house into a playroom why jana dear listen to your mother youre acting like a willful child a willful child im acting like a woman mother who wants something more out of life than just to be massaged five times a day or a man who thinks paradise is having his pipes filled and refilled and his slippers put on and taken off youve got to get rid of them father nelda gretchen suzanne all of them that is quite impossible ill give you a choice get rid of them or ill leave you cant leave jana dear why you simply cant leave well what would happen to you whod look after you what would you do out there id be with normal people mother people who live and work and then die but do it properly the way god intended thats where i want to be out there i want my freedom jana it just isnt possible i want my freedom miss jana youll forgive me but that was most intemperate of you i consider that unforgivable behavior jana you must have respect for your parents i agree you must show respect stop it youre jokes thats what you are hysterical jokes with your sad little homilies and your mouthed cliches youre nothing but walking record players thats all any of you are walking record players jana youre making it difficult for me to be patient very difficult indeed i do apologize father i know how accustomed to perfection you are and i hate to throw a stone in that serene pool of yours but you forgot something do you know that you forgot something they may be indestructible father but youre not jana jana dear you dont really want to leave us do you i thought i made it quite plain father i want you to open the windows and let the air in i want you to let the world in by destroying my whole lifes work jana weve loved you very much if you could only see that all of this has been just as much for you as for ourselves oh jana we love you more than words can tell i know that father i know that then then you will stay oh please stay jana i beg of you please no jana ill do what you asked me to do i promise you ill do it right away

understand normal people were going to give parties and well take trips and well make friends and ill find a young man ill find a young man and before you know it were going to have grandchildren oh father grandchildren whats the matter what is it its what you said about grandchildren you see what your mother means jana what she means is its perfectly normal and natural for parents to think of their children as children and then when suddenly they grow up and they talk of having children of their own its a little difficult for parents to absorb quite so quickly somethings not right somethings not right somethings not right what is it why arent any of my pictures in the photo albums there are no pictures of me here at all jana dear there are many pictures of you heres a picture of you at easter why there are pictures of you decorating the christmas tree last year not as a little girl mother there are no pictures of me as a little girl pictures of you and father and the

childless we had nothing of our flesh to leave behind nothing of our hearts nothing of our love so you see we got you you made me you built me you manufactured me of course the maid was built as a maid the butler manufactured as a butler and the cook and the handyman all for a particular purpose and the daughter you built a daughter jana i created you as a thing of love it doesnt matter what you are or how you got here youre our daughter jana youve got to understand that youre our daughter i cant be your daughter im a thing im a machine a machine jana jana no pain no pain at all no pain
