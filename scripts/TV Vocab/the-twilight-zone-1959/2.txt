answer right there so youll have to give me a couple of months to go over to that zu lu cou ntry no no u n f in ish ed bus in ess of a major natu re is something a man had yearned for and something he m ight accomplish given an extension well there is one thing what is it mr bookman well between you and me i never made a tru ly big p itch i mean i mean a big p itch a p itch big enough for the ski es to open up you know a pitch for the angels of course it wouldnt mean very much to you but it would mean a great deal to me it would mean that for one moment in my whole life i would have done something successful it would mean that maybe the ch i ldren would be very prou d of me the ch i ldren yes yes ive always had qu ite a fon dn ess for ch i ldren you know yes thats all here in the record the problem here mr bookman is that youd requ i re delay u nti l u nti l i make a p itch the kind of p itch i was talking to you about the one for the angels thats right one for the angels im terribly sorry mr bookman but no you see these categories are very specific and when reference is made to u n f in ish ed bus in ess of a major natu re the only i nterpretation to be made here is s imply that what what i mean is that uh u n fortu nately mr bookman an ab i lity to to succeed in a given profess ional ventu re is really hardly of a major m ean a great deal to you does it a great deal all right mr bookman under the circumstances i believe i can grant you a delay u nti l what do you mean u nti l u nti l youve made this p itch i can live ti l then thats the ag reem ent oh well i
