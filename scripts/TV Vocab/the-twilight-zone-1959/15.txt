male system ready  maie 1  lox tanking secured male 2 over radio lox tanking secured  male presenter off her name is the arrow 1 she represents four and a half years of planning preparation and training and a thousand years of science and mathematics and the projected dreams and hopes of not only a nation but a world she is the first manned aircraft into space and this is the countdown the last five seconds before man shot an arrow into the air male over radio three two one zero  one two three four five i still dont understand how we could have lost it with all the monitors we have going if we had 1 5000 monitors going the situation would be the same we lost contact shes off her vector path shes off the radar screen gone completely gone when did you first lose contact less than half hour ago there was a short period of heavy interference now that was probably solar we havent been able to identify it yet in any case when it was over the contact was broken couldnt a change in their course account for that the course was preset now the pilot wouldnt change it without notifying us bob donolans commanding so an aircraft with an eightman crew just disappears like a puff of smoke one moment shes there the next moment shes gone i shot an arrow into the air it landed i know not where a nursery rhyme of the age of space gentlemen wherever you are god help you donolan first entry log arrow 1 colonel rg donolan commanding we have crashlanded on what appears to be an uncharted asteroid cause of malfunction and ultimate crash unknown there was an explosion the electrical system went out thats all any of us remember any of us being flight officers corey and pearson and navigator hudack who has been seriously hurt and myself the rest of the crew dead there is very little left of the aircraft the radio is gone the bulk of the supplies have been destroyed in the crash and as of this moment there is little certainty that we have been tracked and our whereabouts known begging the colonels pardon but this is no time to write your memoirs colonel corey were in bad shape thats for sure but were still a crew and as long as we are a crew therell be discipline and therell be protocol until im lying in the hole then well operate from the book get over there and sit down colonel donolan its hot see its very hot and it makes it hard to think so if youre going to expend all that energy you use it to figure a way out of here a way to let them know where we are corey you heard the colonel pearson you were with corey during the crash what happened to him nothing that i know of sir i cant understand it either how much water is there colonel a fivegallon can what we have on us then why waste it i mean hes not going to live through the afternoon are you the consulting surgeon corey im one man out of three whos going to need water and five gallons isnt going to last very long if the situation were reversed and it was you lying there ill give you odds you wouldnt want to be written off five gallons of water or no corey colonel this mans going to die if he dies he dies but nobody gets behind to push if hes thirsty we give him water if hes hot we move him into the shade then if he goes we give him a prayer or two pearson start making the graves ill relieve you in five m inutes then corey will relieve me pearson whats the matter corey you want him on the detail too colonel thats odd pearson signs of the sun i mean yes i noticed its hardly any different than we knew it on earth which means that whatever asteroid weve landed on is in the same orbit as the earth well wherever we are its a cinch it isnt heaven you can count on that weve got one thing in our favor the air is perfect theres no radiation count to speak of it took four and a half years to build that ship there wasnt any prototype just the one ship the only one of its kind and it took four and a half years to build her so if they know where we are and they want to come and get us theyre gonna have to build another ship how is he the same breathing seems shallower though see anything sir corey yeah we saw something rocks rocks and those scrubby mountains over there this is no asteroid its an eight ball and hot pearson hot like nothing youve ever felt before pearson itll be cooler sir at night if there is a night ill head south towards the mountains ill look in that direction colonel not this time colonel not this time i want an even shake i want a chance youre alive its a better shake than those four got and i want to stay alive so dont give him my water pearson colonel youll be happy to hear corey hes not gonna drink any more of your water colonel its a long way from home for the record corey theres just the three of us now and the big problems gonna be to stay alive i mean the three of us but if i catch you filching just once more just once ill kill you the same thing goes for you knock it off pearson but colonel this guy coionei silence all right well wait until sundown itll be cooler then were going to start taking some treks across the mountain down the flats in all four directions were going to see if theres anything in this god forsaken place that can help keep us alive this is home now gentlemen   pearson corey well nothing not a thing  i must have gone rocks and hills thats all there was just rocks and hills i thought maybe i could get some kind of a fix using the stars but its overcast what about pearson well what about him you were with him he went south towards the mountains i went west towards i went west towards nothing i told you men to stay together corey yeah you didnt see pearson or hear him or anything i already told you colonel we went in different directions its hot out there huh you know it it made you thirsty huh

according to the rules you know your trouble colonel you were looking for morality in the wrong place male presenter off now you make tracks mr corey you move out and up like some kind of ghostly billy club was tapping at your ankles and telling you that it was later than you think you scrabble up rock hills and feel hot sand underneath your feet and every now and then take a look over your shoulder at a giant sun suspended in a dead and motionless sky like an unblinking eye that probes at the back of your head in a prolonged accusation mr corey last remaining member of a doomed crew keep moving make tracks mr corey push up and push out because if you stop if you stop maybe sanity will get you by the throat maybe realization will pry open your mind and the horror you left down in the sand will seep in yeah mr corey yeah you better keep moving thats the order of the moment keep moving pearson oh   now i know what you meant now i know what you were trying to describe  telephone
