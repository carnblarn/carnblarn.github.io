                 male presenter there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man it is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity it is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition and it lies between the pit of mans fears and the summit of his knowledge this is the dimension of imagination it is an area which we call the twilight zone her name is the ss queen of glasgow her registry britsh gross tonnage 5000 age indeterminate at this moment shes one day out of liverpool her destination new york duly recorded on this ships log is the sailing time course to destination weather conditions temperature longitude and latitude but what is never recorded in a log is the fear that washes over a deck like fog and ocean spray fear like the throbbing strokes of engine pistons each like a heartbeat parceling out every hour into breathless minutes of watching waiting and dreading for the year is 1 942 and this particular ship has lost its convoy it travels alone like an aged blind thing groping through the unfriendly dark stalked by unseen periscopes of steel killers yes the queen of glasgow is a frightened ship and she carries with her a premonition ofdeath lights in the salon lets blackout down there sir theyll be finished serving dinner soon sir youd best go in if you want to eat thank you yes sir thank you are you lanser yes

oh no no no please dont get up i havent much time i just wanted to say hello to some of you i do apologize for not being able to get down to dinner we have a miserable fog out there and i thought it best to take my meal on the bridge and the rest of the convoy captain are they in sight they would have to be three feet off the bow to be in sight major that fog out there is very thick we have some hopes of making contact with them tomorrow id feel much safer if we were in convoy i can almost see those wolf packs isnt that what you call them converging on us therell be no wolf packs converging on a single ship major devereaux the principle of the submarine pack is based on the convoy attack the gentleman is quite correct our principal danger would lie in a single submarine ill tell you something id rather they go after us in one of those pocket battleships that you can see not a skulking crummy tin fish a couple of m iles under water if youre being followed youll see the sub mr potter it will surface they wont use all of their torpedoes on us not when they consider the thousand yards and shell us with impunity and sink us at will youll forgive me mister this is mr lanser captain mr lanser but you sound rather like a uboat commander forgive me that was clumsy of me i hope i didnt get any on you miss stanley oh no you didnt get any on me but you did quite a job on yourself there thats quite all right itll stain sir i said its all right steward yes sir as you say sir can i get you some more coffee no thank you that wont be necessary all right sir wont you please

iliar but for that matter they all did mr lanser are you all right yes yes im all right its just that i have these crazy feelings what a feeling of doing things saying things a feeling that youve done them before i know that feeling ive had it occasionally being in a room somewhere and being able to swear that youd been there before even the conversation seems identical to another time and the people yes and the people too how odd i dont seem to recall i dont seem to recall getting on this ship or anything else for that matter its suddenly as if i woke up and found myself standing on deck and hearing your voices coming from the salon like amnesia no not really i know who i am im carl lanser i am carl lanser i was born in frankfurt germany i am in the in the what you were going to tell me you were in something or other who was i i dont remember mr lanser perhaps if you got some sleep no sleep couldnt help me i dont think i could get to sleep i feel as if as if im in a nightmare its

mean is there anything well anything that you want to tell us there is very little that i can tell you as i dont remember anything i dont really know how i got on this ship i dont recall anything about it i seem to remember only odd disjointed things i know for example that my name is carl lanser i know that i was born in frankfurt go on mr lanser go on go on how it seems to be all that i know well at the table you seemed to show a remarkable working knowledge of german submarines could that perhaps give you a thought im afraid it couldnt it doesnt seem to go to bed mr lanser have a good nights rest well talk tomorrow you and i all right thats all mr lanser goodnight goodnight odd very odd id say that he bears watching see that a steward is sent down to his cabin i want to have a look

sir a little shaky perhaps why nothing sir why sir there were people on that ship women too so sir we gave them no warning oh youd have us give them warning huh so their radio operator can signal his position which happens to be incidentally our position you have sentiment muller but no brains youre an old woman you know that i just i just found it difficult to to do what to reconcile the killing of men and women without any warning it makes me wonder if we are not damned now  in the eyes of the britsh adm iralty we most certainly are i mean sir in the eyes of god oh youre not only a fool leutnant but also a religious fool and perhaps a mystic at that suppose we are damned what will happen then ive had dreams about it perhaps theres a special kind of hell for people like us perhaps to be damned is to have a fate like the people on that ship to suffer as they suffered and to die as they die you are a mystic leutnant we ride the ghost of that ship every night every night herr kapitan
