up ahead your next stop the twilight zone nurse time for your sleeping medicine honey is it night already its 930 oh what about the day oh what about it well was it a beautiful day was it warm was the sun out it was kind of warm yes and clouds were there clouds in the sky i suppose there were i never was much for staring up at the sky no i used to like to look at the clouds if you stare at them long enough they become things you know what i mean people ships anything you want really its time to take your temperature now oh please one more thing nurse well when will they take the bandages off how long nurse until they decide whether or not they can fix your face oh i guess its pretty bad isnt it ive seen worse well yes but its pretty bad isnt it oh i know its pretty bad ever since i can remember ever since i was a little girl people have turned away when they looked at me funny the very first thing i can remember is another little child screaming when she looked at me i i never really wanted to be beautiful you know i mean i never wanted to look like a painting i never even wanted to be loved really i just wanted people not to scream when they looked at me when nurse when when when will they take the bandages off maybe tomorrow maybe the next day now hush youve been waiting so long now it doesnt really make much difference whether its two weeks or days now does it dr bernardi evening report on patient 307 no temperature change resting comfortably thank you nurse ill be down later ever see her face 307 indeed i have if it were mine id bury myself in a grave someplace poor thing some people want to live no matter what cigarette suspended in time and space for a moment your introduction to miss janet tyler who lives in a very private world of darkness a universe whose dimensions are the size thickness length of the swath of bandages that cover her face in a moment well go back into this room and also in a moment well look under those bandages keeping in mind of course that were not to be surprised by what we see because this isnt just a hospital and this patient 307 is not just a woman this happens to be the twilight zone and miss janet tyler with you is about to enter it blood pressure and temperature are normal doctor theres been no change all right come back about 1100 nurse give her the usual sedative then all right doctor well its warm this evening miss tyler yes i thought it was but i couldnt be sure well its very warm take my word for that well have those bandages off you very soon i expect youre pretty uncomfortable well im used to bandages on my face i have no doubt its your ninth visit here it is the ninth the 11th you know sometimes i i think ive lived my whole life inside of a dark cave with walls of gauze and the wind that blows into the mouth of the cave smells of ether and disinfectant of course theres a theres a kind of a comfort living inside this cave wonderfully private nobody can ever see you its hopeless isnt it doctor ill never look any different than now well thats hard to say up to now you havent responded to the shots the medications any of the proven techniques frankly youve stumped us miss tyler nothing weve done so far has made any difference at all however were very hopeful for what this last treatment may have accomplished theres no telling of course till we get the bandages off im sorry your case is not one that we could have handled with plastic surgery but your bone structure flesh type many factors prohibit the surgical approach your 11th visit no more after this doctor no more tries of experiments were not permitted to do any more after 11 now what doctor well youre kind of jumping the gun arent you miss tyler you may very well have responded to these last injections theres no way of telling till we get the bandages off and if i havent responded then what well there are alternatives like dont you know yes i know you realize of course miss tyler why these rules are in effect each of us is afforded as much opportunity as possible to fit in with society in your case think of the time and the money and the effort expended to make you look look like what doctor normal the way youd like to look doctor doctor may i walk outside please may i may i just go and and sit in the garden just just for a little while just just to feel the air just just to smell the flowers just just to make believe i am normal if if i sit out there in the darkness then the whole world is dark and im more a part of it like that not just one grotesque ugly woman with a bandage on her face with a special darkness all around i want to belong i want to be like everybody please doctor please help me there are many others who share your misfortune people who look much as you do now one of the alternatives just in the event that this last treatment is not successful is simply to allow you to move into a special area in which people of your kind have been congregated people of my kind congregated oh you mean segregated you mean imprisoned dont you doctor youre talking about a ghetto arent you a ghetto designed for freaks miss tyler now the state is not unsympathetic your presence here in this hospital is proof of that its doing all it can for you but youre not being rational miss tyler now you know you cant expect to live any kind of a life among normal people i could try i i could wear a mask or this bandage or i wouldnt bother anybody id just go my own way id get a job any job i who are you people anyway what is this state who makes all these rules and conditions and statutes the people who are different have to stay away from the people who are normal the state isnt god doctor miss tyler please please the state is not god it hasnt the right to penalize somebody for an accident of birth it hasnt the right to make ugliness a crime miss tyler miss tyler stop this immediately i feel the night out there i feel the air i can smell the flowers oh oh please please take this off me please please take this off me oh please take this off me take it off me help somebody help me help no no no let me go please let me go let me go please oh please please let me go please please let me all right then i will take the bandages off get the anesthetist yes doctor you look tired doctor do i well i hadnt thought about it i suppose i am youve been under a great deal of tension i know how much it means to you this case in 307 well you try to be impersonal about these things you do everything medically possible everything humanly possible and then in the end you cross your fingers and you hope for a miracle you know once in a while a miracle does happen just often enough to let you know that youre not wrong or foolish to hope for one but youre destroying yourself this way forgive me but you mustnt let yourself get personally involved here i know you think i havent told myself that but you see nurse ive ive looked underneath those bandages so have i its horrible no i mean deeper than that deeper than that pitiful twisted lump of flesh deeper even than that misshapen skeletal mask ive seen that womans real face nurse the face of her real self its a good face its a human face i understand but i must confess its easier for me to think of her as human when her face is covered up but why why must we feel that way nurse what is the dimensional difference between beauty and something repellant is it skin deep oh less than that why nurse why shouldnt people be allowed to be different why doctor careful what youre talking is treason oh this case has upset your balance your sense of values well i suppose dont be concerned nurse ill be all right once the bandages are off once iknowone way or the other leaders speaking tonight he goes on in just a few minutes and now ladies and gentlemen our leader good evening ladies and gentlemen tonight i shall talk to you about glorious conformity about the delight and the ultimate pleasure of our unified society now i have to ask you once again miss tyler and i must insist that you promise youll remain rational no tantrums no temperament and no violence you understand now ill tell you precisely what im going to do im going to cut the bandages a section at a time then im going to unwrap the bandages very gradually the process has to be slow so that your eyes can become accustomed to the light as you know these injections may have had some effect on your vision i understand so now as i unwrap i want you to keep your eyes open and i want you to describe to me the various shadings of light as you perceive it all right now if you make any movement or if you start getting emotional on us miss tyler im going to have to have the nurses hold you down and have the anesthetist put you under sedation you understand i promise i wont all right then do you see any light now miss tyler oh just a little it looks gray all right now just be very quiet now miss tyler oh it its much brighter good good look look up toward the light how about now miss tyler oh yes it its very bright good good now im at the last layer of bandages miss tyler oh i i can just see you i can just distinguish your outline vaguely but i can just see you good all right miss tyler im going to remove the last of the bandages now would you like a mirror no no thank you no mirror all right then i want you to remember this please miss tyler are you listening yes im listening now we have done all we could do if weve been successful well and good there are no problems but if on the other hand this final treatment has not achieved the desired result please remember miss tyler that you can still live a long and fruitful life among people of your own kind now as soon as we discover the results well either release you or doctor yes if im still terribly ugly well is there any other alternative could i please be put away well under certain circumstances miss tyler the state does provide for the extermination of undesirables however there are many factors to be considered in the decision under the present circumstances i i doubt very much whether we would be permitted to do anything but transfer you to a communal group of people with your disability theyll make me go then that would probably be the case now remain very quiet keep your eyes open all right miss tyler here comes the last of it i wish you every good luck no change no change at all i was afraid of this turn on the light needle please life at the stop that patient stop her we know now that there must be a single purpose a single norm a single approach a single entity of people a single virtue a single morality a single frame of reference a single philosophy of government we must cut out all that is different like a cancerous filth it is essential in this society that we not only have a norm but that we conform to that norm differences weaken us variations destroy us this norm is what has ended nations and brought them to their knees conformity we must worship in all interests conformity is the key to survival miss tyler miss tyler dont be afraid hes hes only a representative from the group youre going to live with oddly enough youve come right to him now come on now dont be afraid hes not going to hurt you he wont hurt you dont be afraid its all right its all right miss tyler now this is mr smith mr walter smith mr smith is in charge of the village group in the north hell take you there tonight its the only way now miss tyler we have a lovely village and wonderful people i think youre going to like it where im going to take you youll uh youll be with your own kind and in a little while oh youll be amazed how little a while youll feel a sense of great belonging youll feel a sense of being loved and you will be loved miss tyler miss tyler would you get your things now we can leave anytime mr smith yes why do we have to look like this i dont know miss tyler i really dont know but you know something it doesnt matter theres an old saying a very very old saying beauty is in the eye of the beholder when we leave here when we go to the village try to think of that miss tyler say it over and over to yourself beauty is in the eye of the beholder come on now well get your things and well leave goodbye miss tyler now the questions that come to mind where is this place and when is it what kind of world where ugliness is the norm and beauty the deviation from that norm you want an answer it doesnt make any difference because the old saying happens to be true beautyis in the eye of the beholder in this year or a hundred years hence on this planet or wherever there is human life perhaps out amongst the stars beauty is in the eye of the beholder lesson to be learned in the twilight zone rod
