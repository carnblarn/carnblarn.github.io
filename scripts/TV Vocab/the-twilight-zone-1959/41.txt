storm excuse me i saw light here what do you want from us shelter and maybe some food we cannot help you you will have to leave now mr ellington now the prostrate form of mr david ellington scholar seeker of truth and regrettably finder of truth a man who will shortly arise from his exhaustion to confront a problem that has tormented mankind since the beginning of time a man who knocked on a door seeking sanctuary and found instead the outer edges of the twilight zone help me no please in the name of mercy help me youre not one of them no my name is ellington im an american shh we have only moments come closer come theyre mad mr ellington all of them raving mad listen i was in the village in schwartzwald i was walking in the street with my woman we paused to rest by a tree and we kissed is it wrong to kiss tell me i i dont think so of course you dont you dont think so i dont think so but jerome the lecherous old fool we looked up and i saw him standing close by i tried to open my mouth to speak but before i could utter a sound he raised that heavy staff he carries youve seen it and he hit me again and again why for revenge because she refused his advances he took his fury out on me i im sorry i i find this difficult to believe of course you do mr ellington thats the strength of the man he makes his madness seem a harmless thing the the madness of a religious zealot this is not a religious order mr ellington these socalled brothers of truth theyre outcasts misfits cut off from the world because the world wont have them mr ellington please you must believe me i dont say theyre evil i say theyre mad where are you going ill speak to jerome no hes the greatest maniac of them all but then how can i help you mr ellington i did not know that you were well enough to walk come with me please i must talk with you this way i must ask you to leave the hermitage mr ellington we have no facilities for the care of the ill arrangements can made at schwartzwald just a minute no not a minute not another second mr ellington  now why i have already explained that no youve explained nothing no one asked me to come here i realize that but thats no excuse for your behavior my son im not your son you dont understand thats right i dont so why dont you tell me why are you in such a hurry for me to leave what are you afraid ill find out its the man you have locked up in the cell isnt it brother well that isnt a secret anymore i know about him what man is this mr ellington the one we just left the one whos been screaming his head off im not sure you know what youre saying look brother i dont know much about this cult of yours whats permitted what isnt permitted but i seriously doubt if you have the authority to imprison a man against his will that is quite true we have no such authority then why have you done it no man has ever been imprisoned in the hermitage mr ellington i was just talking with him you talked to no man you have been very ill mr ellington youve suffered delirium oh now dont tell me you didnt hear that honest men make unconvincing liars ill find out eventually you know what do you mean just what i say the police will be very interested to learn that you people are keeping a man in prison here i tell you there is no man all right just forget it mr ellington yes would you really go to the police would you very well i have told you the truth but only a part of it now i see i shall have to tell you the whole truth shut the door mr ellington then you do hear it as i have heard it every hour of every day for five long years why did you lie i didnt when i told you that no man howled at the hermitage i was being perfectly honest what you saw is not a man it is the devil himself yes the devil himself what you saw in the cell is satan otherwise known as the dark angel ahriman asmodeus belial diabolus the devil you asked for the truth now you have it you do believe me dont you uh sure of course no now it is you who are lying mr ellington you dont believe me at all quite to the contrary youre now quite certain of what you suspected that i am mad sit down mr ellington and well see let me tell you a story and well see how certain you are that i am mad how certain you are of anything i suppose you fancy yourself a sophisticated man you consider us to be primitive because we live here in solitude away from the socalled real world we are misfits no no oh please i know all the theories i assure you brother that no mr ellington it is i who am assuring you i am not the ignorant fanatic i would appear oh i coped with your world for 40 years and rather successfully at that the best schools a degree in philosophy a job that took me to the ends of the earth this beard this staff and this faith are merely the results of a different point of view if you could understand that you could listen to what i have to say with an open mind five years ago there were no howls in the hermitage there was simply the bombedout ruin of an old castle belonging to the family wolfen baron wolfen gave it to the brotherhood of truth as a gesture of charity our job was to tend the vineyards and save what souls we could by constant prayer but this isnt a religious order is it brother we feel that we are recognized by god truth is our dogma we believe it to be mans greatest weapon against the devil who is the father of all lies all right go on with your story you were tending the vineyards at that time shortly after the great war the world was in chaos everywhere was unhappiness except in this little village below for some reason the people of schwartzwald refused to yield to despair they lost none of their faith they continued as they had been for centuries honest godfearing and happy this village was a plum to satan one he could not resist so he came here and embarked upon a program of corruption but you stopped him yes you see mr ellington he made the same mistake thatyouhave made he underestimatedme he thought he would have no difficulty in tempting the old fool but i had him in a cell before he knew what happened but if hes the devil how do you keep him locked up with the staff of truth the one barrier he cannot pass tell me how did yourecognize him he doesnt look evil the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape i had seen him before in all parts of the world in all forms and guises wherever there was sin wherever there was strife wherever there was corruption persecution there he was also sometimes he was only a spectator a face in the crowd but always he was there now you see i hope why you must say nothing of what youve seen and heard here brother its not that i doubt you you understand only isnt it possible you might have made a mistake no think mr ellington think of the peace of the world these last five years think of this country now is there another like it you havent put an end to suffering theres still murders robberies even now while were talking people are starving the suffering man wasmeantto endure we cause most of our own griefs we need no help from him it is the unnatural catastrophes the great wars the overwhelming pestilences the wholesale sinning that we have stopped i believe you brother do youtruly yes i admit i was doubtful at first but youve convinced me absolutely i promise to keep your secret good my son tomorrow if you feel well enough you may leave in the meantime brother christophorus will look after you please go directly to his room good night brother he lied to you didnt he i can see that what did he say he said you were the devil the devil thats good thats wonderful what a dream for an old devil to catch the devil and lock him up you dont believe him do you no of course not then help me look here why dont i just go get the authorities it would be my death warrant the authorities would return and find nothing jerome is mad but hes shrewd too brother jerome was fearful you might lose your way come why are you locking the door to protect you rest now mr ellington remember youre still a very sick man youve come good what do you want me to do lift off the wooden bolt is this all that holds you in yes lift it off well why havent you done it yourself please theres no time for talk mr ellington in the name of mercy if you fail now theyll kill both of us dont you understand that hurry hurry stop stop put this on the storm im sorry for you my son all your life you will remember this night and youll know mr ellington whom you have turned loose upon the world i i didnt believe you i i saw him and didnt recognize him that is mans weakness and satans strength in that moment i decided to spend the rest of my life tracking him down to recapture the evil id released the evil that soon took the shape of the second world war the korean war the hideous new weapons of war i swore id find him again as brother jerome had done it took many years but i did it see i have him in there now so you understand now you understand why you must not under any circumstances go near that door you see how important it is that he stay locked up good i am sending him back to brother jerome hell do a bit of howling but pay no attention to that its a trick i know yes i must go now i must go i i have preparations to make ill be back in just a few minutes remember remember keep that door locked you can catch the devil but you cant hold him long ask brother jerome ask david ellington they know and theyll go on knowing till the end of their days and beyond in the twilight zone rod serling creator of
