                youre traveling through another dimension a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination thats the signpost up ahead your next stop the twilight zone how are you today mr finchley ill answer that burning question after you tell me whats wrong with that miracle of modern science and also exactly how much this current larceny is going to cost me well theres two hours labor broken set of tubes new oscillator and a new filter how very technical and how very convincing i presume im to be dunned once again for three times the worth of the blasted thing last time i was over here youd kicked your foot through the screen remember i have a vivid recollection thank you the set was not working properly i tried to get it to do so in a perfectly normal fashion by kicking your foot through the screen why didnt you just horsewhip it mr finchley thatd show it whos boss supposing we stop this moronic small talk shall we and get down to some serious larceny you may read me off the damages although i sometimes wonder what exactly is the purpose of the better business bureau when it allows itinerant extortionists like you to come back week after week move wires around busily probe with hamlike hands and achieve nothing but the financial ruin of every customer were not a gyp outfit mr finchley were legitimate repairmen but ill tell you something about yourself that tv set doesnt work because obviously you got in back of it and you yanked out a lot of wires and i dont know what else now a month ago you called me over here to fix your portable radio because you threw it downstairs that did not work properly either well thats the point mr finchley why dont they work properly offhand id say its because you dont treat them properly i assume therell be an extra charge for that analysis what does go wrong with these things mr finchley have you got any idea aside from being a rather incompetent clod youre a very unreceptive man i have already explained to you the television set simply did not work properly and as for that marconi original operating under the guise of a modern radio that gave nothing but static are you sure thats all that was wrong with them all right mr finchley ill send you a bill of that i have no doubt finchley what is it with you and machines i shall file that idiotic question in my memorabilia to be referred to at some future date when i write my memoirs you my good friend will fill one entire chapter entitled the most forgettable person i ever met it just so happens that every machine in this house is all right that will be enough of that do you hear me i said that will be enough of that stop stop this is mr bartlett finchley age 48 a practicing sophisticate who writes very special and very precious things for gourmet magazines and the like hes a bachelor and a recluse with few friends only devotees and adherents to the cause of tart sophistry he has no interests save whatever current annoyances he can put his mind to he has no purpose to his life except the formulation of daytoday opportunities to vent his wrath on mechanical contrivances of an age he abhors in short mr bartlett finchley is a malcontent born either too late or too early in the century and who in just a moment will enter a realm where muscles and the will to fight back are not limited to human beings next stop for mr bartlett finchley the twilight zone miss rogers is this all youve done thats all ive done thats 30 pages in three hours and a half thats the best i can do mr finchley its that idiotic machine that typewriter of yours thomas jefferson wrote the entire declaration of independence with a feather quill and it took him only half a day why dont you hire mr jefferson miss rogers did i ever tell you with what degree of distaste i view insubordination often and endlessly ill tell you what mr finchley you get yourself another girl one with three arms and with roughly the same sensitivity as an alligator then you can work together till death do you part as for me ive had it and you are going where anyplace where i can be away from the highly articulate oh so sophisticated bon vivant of americas winers and diners a mr bartlett finchley you even got me talking like you miss rogers please dont leave i beg your pardon i do wish youd i wish youd stay for a bit oh i dont mean for work or anything all that can wait i was just thinking that we could have dinner or something the theater perhaps how very sweet mr finchley thank you but no thank you goodbye mr finchley before you go miss rogers before you go yes id like very much id like very much not to be alone for a while are you ill bad news or something no whats your trouble does there have to be trouble just because i im desperately tired i havent slept for four nights quite frankly the thought of being alone just now is intolerable miss rogers things have been happening very odd things go on that television machine in there it goes on late at night and wakes me up just goes on all by itself that radio i kept in the bedroom that went on and off too just when i was going to sleep theres a conspiracy in this house miss rogers conspiracy thats exactly what it is a conspiracy the television set the radio the clock even that miserable car i drive last night i drove it into the driveway just drove it into the driveway mind you very carefully very slowly the steering wheel turned in my hand it twisted itself in my hand the car deliberately hit the side of the garage it smashed a headlight it cost 140 that clock over the mantelpiece oh uh i threw it away what im getting at miss rogers is that for as long as i have lived i have never been able to operate machines mr finchley i think you ought to see a doctor a doctor the universal panacea of the dreamless 20thcentury idiot if youre depressed see a doctor if youre happy see a doctor if the salary is too low and the mortgage is too high see a doctor you miss rogers yousee a doctor i am a logical rational intelligent man i know what i see i know what i hear and for the past three months ive been seeing and hearing a collection of mechanical frankensteinian monsters whose whole purpose is to destroy me now what do you think of that miss rogers i think youre terribly ill and you need medical attention i also think that youre suffering from a bad case of nerves due to lack of sleep and that way down deep you yourself realize that these are nothing more than delusions i will not be intimidated by machines so it follows that no emptyheaded little female with a mechanical face can do anything to me either mr finchley in this conspiracy you speak of this mortal combat between you

what it was that could have scared him whatever it was its a little item he took along with him yeah maybe he was drunk imagining things maybe could be he had a heart attack or something could be it could just be yes it could just be it could just be that mr bartlett finchley succumbed from a heart attack and a set of delusions it could just be that he was tormented by an imagination as sharp as his wit and as pointed as his dislikes but as perceived by those attending this is one explanation that has left the premises with the deceased look for it filed under m for machines in the twilight
