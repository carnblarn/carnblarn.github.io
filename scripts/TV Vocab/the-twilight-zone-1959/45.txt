gets exactly what he deserves im old marty oh mr templeton you could never be old old and getting older every minute that we stand here speaking they say or at least theyve said it in most of my plays that when a man achieves years he achieves reason and contentment i havent mr templeton may i suggest that possibly this isnt the day for you to go down there perhaps i should telephone the theater and explain that you cant start rehearsals well thank you marty but ill go down there i shall rehearse this play and it will open i shall cover up the years with makeup and i shall stand in the right places and hope to say the right lines and when its over theyll all say to me you were wonderful mr templeton then the stage manager will see to it that im properly delivered to you so that you can properly deliver me back here so that i can go back there and do it all over again next night i wont see nor particularly care about whats going on outside there or anywhere in this house all i want will be to go to bed marty thats the best place for me bed sleep oblivion now sir you shouldnt talk like that oh it doesnt matter i dont love her anymore i dont remember when i did you know i cant

sperry yes mr sperry i i apologize that was impolite of me i wont forget again call his home call his home valencia never mind some of us are young some of us are old but neither state precludes any of us young or old from ignoring the basic cooperation that will be necessary here when i direct there are no significant personalities in the cast of any play but there are three significant dates in the life of a play the first day of rehearsal opening night closing night the last two are related and dependent upon the first therefore the first day of rehearsal is an extremely important day when
