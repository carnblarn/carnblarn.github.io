then my father it killed him too look at it look at it the meanness of it the shabbiness of it the handtomouth of it it isnt just an antique shop where you pick up the pitiful remnants of other peoples failures its a shrine to failure itself thats what it is its a mausoleum a burial ground for for peoples hopes edna what happens to us anyway what happens to us were not old people and yet this place is making us old there must be years ahead of us that come without scrimping and counting and picking over checkbooks and budgets and final notices and old bills hey hey mr and mrs arthur castle gentle and infinitely patient people whose lives have been a hope chest with a rusty lock and a lost set of keys but in just a moment that hope chest will be opened and an improbable phantom will try to bedeck the drabness of these two peoples failureladen lives with the gold and precious stones of fulfillment mr and mrs arthur castle standing on the outskirts and about to enter the twilight zone how do you do rather than go into any lengthy generic explanation of my existence suffice it to say that i am a genie thats quite correct a genie i can offer you four wishes with a guaranteed performance well mr castle mrs castle what have you in mind arthur whats happening to us hes a hypnotist or something nothing of the sort i grant four wishes to the owner then go back inside the bottle for a century and a year until a summons comes from the next owner now i think the business at hand is for you and mrs castle to decide upon the nature of your four wishes keeping in mind of course edna that each wish is irrevocable once made it is fulfilled and once fulfilled it is a matter of record it can only be altered by yet another wish clear mr castle i think wed better call the police wish for them i can bring you scotland yard the federal bureau of investigation or every bobby in the city of london is it the police you want no that is not what we would wish for arthur you out of your mind you believe him please go on mr castle you were saying well if i had a wish just for the sake of argument id say i wanted that broken glass in that case to be fixed would you like to make it official mr castle well mr castle is that your wish yes that is my wish i want that glass in that display case to be repaired well mr castle you have three wishes left three wishes three wishes three wishes anything we want well think think what do you want nothing arthur i want nothing a new shop an expensive shop on fifth avenue we could have that just for the asking or money

for europe very shortly dependents the whole neighborhood oh no they dont count what does that figure there mean a million dollars mr castle taxed on the basis of a husband and wife using the standard deductions you owe the government approximately 907000 what yes thats correct then in addition theres a state income tax involved which using thumb rule the whole thing comes to a total of roughly mind you 942640 arthur weve already given away a lot of money well now if youll just fill out this form and send it to us with your check oh uh if you want to use the installment plan well send you a statement after the form has been analyzed uh mr castle yeah yeah yeah just send us a bill well well be seeing you mr castle good evening mrs castle well 910530 910535 910540 we gave away almost 60000 and this goes to taxes and this and this five dollars yeah quite a wish arthur quite a wish and we havent even paid those bills yet mr castle it was my suggestion that you reflect very carefully mr castle very very carefully now had you made a wish that took into account the taxes involved oh look you plenty of sweet talk and promises and the whole thing and all the time youre nothing but a con artist this time i want the million dollars but i want itafter arthur no more money you got to wish for something else something else how about ten more wishes or 20 dont be in such a hurry arthur then you think of something im afraid wishing for more wishes isnt permitted mr castle frankly id be afraid to have you try for fear of the consequences what consequences why do you keep losing your temper well youre no help for me thats for sure here we stand in this crummy little shop with the whole world out in front of us with anything to wish for that we want and you just stay on my back arthur edna what whats happening with us whats going on oddly enough mr castle this is the normal pattern that seems to be generally followed great excitement great emotionalism strangely enough hard to believe though it may be only a modicum of happiness well you got a couple of cheap customers here mister people that havent known much happiness what what what do we wish for i wish i knew arthur i dont know what about it genie what can we wish for now what can come to us without tricks without tricks i question the semantics here mr castle there are no tricks involved there are simply normal and understandable outgrowths and conditions that go with any windfall no matter what you wish for you must be prepared for the consequences something without consequences something dead sure something anchored something airtight edna i think i got it i think i know what it is what arthur power power edna to be in charge of something the boss to be a leader we could wish for that possible very possible president of a corporation that sort of thing he could go bankrupt mayor of a city you get voted out of office then what wait a minute wait a minute i know what head of a country ruler of a whole country thats it what about it genie i want to be the head of a country who cant be voted out of office do you want to be more specific than that wait a minute let me give it to you this way i want to be the head of a foreign country who cant be voted out of office but it must be a contemporary country contemporary within this century no problems what about consequences consequences mr castle ive already told you you run the risk of consequences no matter what you wish for all right then go ahead arthur you wish for that i want to be the ruler of a foreign country just as ive described it go ahead genie take over as you wish mr castle from now on its just a mass suicide well what about it fuhrer head of a country cant be voted out of office im hitler im in a bunker its the end of the war mein fuhrer what you asked for very quick and very painless mein fuhrer and we have the gasoline outside for you and miss braun when you finish i wish i wish i were back where it all started i wish i were arthur castle again whats the matter arthur you look so funny what happened i had a wish fulfilled number four all the wishes ended the same way in fragments little pieces funny thing though this place this this place doesnt look half bad you all right oh im fine well maybe well stop wishing for a while and since we obviously cant afford a brandnew life suppose we give the old one a paint job or something i think thats a very good idea what are you laughing at we came out of it ahead anyway shouldnt be a total loss a word to the wise now to the garbage collectors of the world to the curio seekers to the antique buffs to everyone who would try to coax out a miracle from unlikely places check that bottle youre taking back for a twocent deposit the genie you save might
