here id be very glad to and get that crummy red suit back to wherever you rented it from before you really tie one on and destroy it you drunk thank you very much mr dundee as to my drinking this is indefensible and you have my abject apologies i find of late that i have very little choice in the matter of expressing emotions i can either drink or i can weep and drinking is so much more subtle will you please leave as for my insubordination i was not rude to that woman someone should remind her that christmas is more than barging up and down department store aisles and pushing people out of the way now corwin someone has to tell her that christmas is another thing finer than that richer finer truer and it should come with patience and love charity compassion thats what i would have told her if youd given me the chance well how philosophical mr corwin now perhaps as your parting word you can tell us how we can go about living up to these wondrous yule standards which you have so graciously laid down for us i dont know how to tell you mr dundee i dont know at all all i know is that im an aging purposeless relic of another time and i live in a dirty rooming house on a street filled with hungry kids and shabby people where the only thing that comes down the chimney on christmas eve is more poverty will you keep your voice down do you know another reason why i drink mr dundee so that when i walk down the tenements i can really think its the north pole and the children are elves and that im really santa claus bringing them a bag of wondrous gifts for all of them i just wish mr dundee on one christmas only one that i could see some of the hopeless ones and the dreamless ones just on one christmas id like to see the meek inherit the earth and thats why i drink mr dundee and thats why i weep george you want another drink hey look its santa claus look theres santa claus come on in nah nah go on get lost get out of here merry christmas santas a lush hey everybody

bottle of wine merry christmas officer merry christmas whats your name henry corwin or is it maybe its santa claus or kris kringle i dont know youre drunk corwin is that it of course im drunk im

settle this in a hurry have you got a receipt for this stuff receipt of course youve got a receipt no sister florence would you please collect all the stolen goods and put them in a pile over there ill send for them when i check on who owns them come on santa be right with you officer dont worry about a thing gentlemen theres more where this came from officer let me tell you how this whole thing started i was having a glass down at jacks place it was just about 430 in the afternoon when i got there like i said officer i arrived at jacks place about 430 between 430 and 500 the cocktail hour jack wasnt there but bruce was i know bruce yes right here after you i had a sandwich that i couldnt finish and i got to talking uhhuh here he is and here we are and there that is and here you are how nice to see you again mr dundee and how nice it will be to see my wistful saint nicholas going up the river do you suppose he can get as much ten years ten years well it dont look good corwin of course they could lop off a few months if you was to tell them where the rest of the loot was hes been giving out the stuff for two and half hours he must have a warehouse full of it im glad you brought that up there seems to be a slight discrepancy here listen you motheaten robin hood the wholesale theft of thousands of dollars worth of goods is not a slight discrepancy though i can tell you right now corwin this whole affair comes as no surprise to me id perceived that criminal glint in your eyes the first minute id laid eyes on you it seems to me that youve put your finger on the problem mr dundee this bag doesnt know whether to give out gifts or garbage it was giving out gifts when i seen it whatever they was wanting corwin was supplying all kinds of stuff toys gifts expensive stuff admit it corwin oh i admit it i admit it but it seems to me the essence of our problem is that were dealing with a most unusual bag my advice to you is to clean up this mess and get out here officer flaherty you call yourself a policeman well i suppose it is a demanding task to distinguish between a bag full of garbage and an inventory of expensive stolen gifts mr dundee believe me its like corwin says were dealing with the supernatural here in other words all we have to do is to ask mr corwin to make a little abracadabra for us and no sooner said done well go ahead corwin i fancy a bottle of cherry brandy vintage 1903 oh thats a good year and as for you officer flaherty how dare you drag me down here at the busiest time of the year to look at a bag full of garbage mr dundee pardon me gentlemen merry christmas to both of you to mr dundee from santa here mr dundee you need one heres beautiful yellow sweater for you i want a toy ive got a beautiful toy for you i want an electric train engine electric train engine diesel or steam i dont care there it is i want a dolly you want a dolly a blonde brunette blonde here she is i want a toy please oh ive got one here for

since the beginning of time nothing for you nothing for yourself not a thing you know i i cant think of anything i want i guess what ive really wanted is to be the biggest gift giver of all times and in a way i think i had that tonight although if i had my choice of any gift any gift at all i think id wish i could do this every year thatd be some gift wouldnt it burt oh it sure would god bless you burt and merry christmas to you merry christmas to you too santa and thanks for the smoking jacket and the pipe dont mention it weve been waiting quite a while for you santa claus oh no did you hear

flaherty going home mr dundee and you going home officer flaherty this is the most remarkable christmas eve ive ever had flaherty i could have sworn that i did you see it i thought i did what did you see i dont think i ought to tell you you might report me for drinking on duty go ahead what did you see it was corwin mr dundee big as life in a sleigh with reindeer sitting next to an elf and riding up toward the sky thats about the size of it aint it mr dundee flaherty you better come home with me and well pour out some hot coffee and well pour some brandy in it and well and well thank god for miracles flaherty a word to the wise to all the children of the 20th century whether their concern be pediatrics or geriatrics whether they crawl on hands and knees and wear diapers or walk with a cane and comb their beards theres a wondrous magic to christmas and theres a special power reserved for little people in short theres nothing mightier than the meek captioned by media access group at
