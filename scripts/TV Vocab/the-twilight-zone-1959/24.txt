ch i ldren aging my friends dying this was something that i hadnt considered you see but surely there theres some answer to that problem is there think about it i tell you that som ehow i can stop you from aging where do you want to stop at 30 then you watch everyon e around you grow old at 70 do you want to live forever the way you are now old s ick its better than dying no youre wrong sam i was
