when ever we fly when ever we flew over the german lin es the soldi ers f i red at us well one day mack got h it in a most em barrassing spot i always called him old leadbottom after that its a private joke of course macks a prou d fellow you know he wouldnt like it if i bru ited it about but why do you keep i ns isting that hes dead because the last i saw of him he was caug ht in a ci rcle of seven german plan es there was nothing i could do about it of course i was i nvolved with three oth ers obviously h e got away i dont see how he could have not only could have he did he was one of britai ns great h eroes du ring the blitz that was the secon d war we told you about won the dfc for knocking down three german bombers one night over london he undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives maybe even thousands decker you manag e s i r yes you can wait outside whats wrong decker ive got to leave thats imposs i ble mackaye will be here in a while well get to the bottom of this i cant see him why not hell know me for what i am what are you im a coward im a coward ive always been a coward all my life ive been ru n ning away preten ding to be something i never was never could be thats why im here because i was trying to ru n away because i wanted so desperately to escape that i did escape oh i got by with my pretending well enough my kind of strain ed i diocy is exactly the brand we all put on were playing a part you know boys on a larklaughing joking drinking oh its too much all of it and turning into deadly icecold ki llers in the sky although not me of course no not me u p there im just as afrai d as i am on the grou n d and mack and i are su pposed to go on patrols together but uh i can usually manag e to persuade him into splitting up you know i think he actually hopes hell ru n into some trou ble m e well i j ust ling er in the clou ds flying back and forth dreading the poss i b i lity that i might see an en emy plan e and just hoping for enough time to pass so that i can go back you know sometimes i think ill land beh in d the german lin es and ill let myself be captu red the pilots always get the best of treatm ent you know but im afrai d of doing that even im afrai d that id be discovered and discredited i couldnt bear that i have to carry on the selfdelusion you know you know ive actually f i red bu llets th roug h the cockp it walls so that the chaps will see them and be impressed god h elp me  it isnt a cri me to be afrai d decker everybodys afrai d at one time or anoth er im sure mackaye would u n derstand that no well what makes you think he knows anyway because it was me that let the g ermans trap him but i thought you said you were fighting three g erman plan es yourself i wasnt fighting anyone i was ru n ning i was ru n ning when the germans came at us i left him up there to die but he didnt die well i cant u n derstand that well maybe h e got h elped somehow whats the matter what you said what that he got h elp its certain ly in the realm of poss i b i liti es dont you see maybe it was me that h elped him i said wh en he got h elp i meant that somebody else there wasnt anyone with in 50 m i les who could have h elped him maybe it wasnt an accident that i lan ded here maybe i was brought here for a pu rpose to f in d out that mack had su rvived to f in d out that time was giving me a secon d chance youve got to let me go but i cant youve got to dont you see its the only chance i have its the only chance he has but hes alive hes coming here today how do you know that if i dont get back he wont be here how do you
