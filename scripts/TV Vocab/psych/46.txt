that thing was supposed to be  oh come on  you sound like the judges  look at it its painfully obvious even now  it looks more like ann margaret  what  i had it narrowed down to eric stoltz or boris becker   jason cunningham  killer b  sup man salmon run  shawn its good to see you  cunningham  who would make an eric stoltz pinata that doesnt make any sense  and what are you thinking man  children

the 13th is your new life plan  hey look i read the paper  all right you guys uncovered a dinosaur  and rescued a mummy in the same calendar year  i need your help  as detectives and as old friends  werewere sort of missing a counselor  what does that  what does that even mean sort of missing  i know what youre thinking  and there are million possible explanations  her name is annie shes kind of a loner  shes a hiker she never tells us where shes going  look i dont say this very often  but it sounds like one for the proper authorities  are you kidding  i call the cops and the press gets a hold of this theyll go crazy  the camp murder stories will start all over  and ill be dead in the water before i ever open  shawn please  look i poured 20 grand into this  all right its all ive got  look imim sorry cunningham  but my gut is saying no   in thx  shawn  if you cant do it for that poor girl or an old friend with a good heart  do it for the children  those kids its for the kids  all right  may i help you detective  just thought these might brighten the place up a bit  wow what a wonderful sentiment for you to buy these for me  actually i bought four just to have options  but these are by far and away the worst ones  must be poisonous  tried to give em to the lady down at fingerprinting but  turns out shes a man  from birth  i see well thank you i guess  youre welcome  here you get to choose between these two  they didnt make the cut either  be careful though one of ems expired  may i ask what brought on this generosity  yes you may  i have a very special dinner date this evening with my estranged wife  yourereconciling  things have been pretty good between us lately  weve been friendly  beyond friendly ive been asking her to go to gerards for months  and shes finally accepted  gerards thats a surprisingly chic choice detective  its where we had our first date  back then it was a greasy spoon i got diarrhea for a long while  they actually changed some health codes because of it  butnew beginnings and all you get the connection  wellheh  i really truly wish you the best carlton   thank you  but maybe  you should be a little cautioushere  how so  you know the whole eggs in the basket jumping with both feet  hey youre a woman is it too early to bring up kids  man this place brings back so many bad memories  shawn you need to let the pinata thing go  we were 11 i wanted to win  it wasnt about winning or losing gus  it was about you and me  being an unflappable twoheaded preteen phenomenon  like the mowry twins sticking together no matter what  youre all doomed  all right were out of here  shawn stop it  hes kidding look at him  yeah clearly  he has a folksy sense of humor the garrison keillor of tikihama  turn around before we get stabbed  where is he going  i dont know  this doesnt feel right man  we should not be here  looklets just get it done  well find the girl and get home for some berner wurstel in a couple hours  my treat  scuse me   is jason around  were old friends of his  i think hes inside trying to figure out whats eating gilbert grape  turns out it was a flesheating virus  oh i get it youre the funny guy  you guys must be counselors  im clive  in charge of all water activities or anything wet  billy fitnessnutrition body sculpting  im a bit of a fitness buff myself im training for the santa barbara 1k  thats only about 3000 feet  theres not a lot of training involved  hello   oh please dont do this  do what  every time you see a marginally cute girl   you lose all semblance of reason  i dont do that  just like you dont flick your nose with your thumb  when youre trying to act cool  jason we made it   what the hell happened to him  hes fine   those are nurses shoes  theyre probably very comfortable  theyre both left feet  hello burton  shane  im so glad you could drop by  i had some biscuits in the oven  but i forgot to light the pilot  jason are you feeling okay  im super  did i tell you about the biscuits  uh my name is shawn spencer im a psychic   this is my partner lumpkin  my name is gus   but you can call me slicks  slicks  whats your name  sissy arts and crafts   how are you  good thank you  anyway we are here to help track down your missing counselor  i thought you said annie called  i thought she i thought she i thought she would call  she hasnt she hasnt called but were sure shes fine  jasonwhat havent you told em   you guys are aware that this is a  billy  lets keep our business our business  okay  this is just about annie  now  show them the camp house   whats with the doll  its for the kids shawn  and i know what youre doing  youre trying to interpret everything as creepy  just because youre jealous of jason  lets just get this over with  this place is musty  its vintage shawn   hello sissy  hi slicks  this is the last place we know annie was for sure  i talked to her on the phone last night  she wasnt feeling well at all  well then  my guess is that she didnt get up at the crack of dawn and go for a hike  so you guys really came here when you were kids huh  well you know how it is  do the bunk bed thing  make some lanyards catch a fish  go home early because some repairman got electrocuted in the swimming pool  and the camp closed  oh my god that really happened  yes it was a tragic accident and it happened 20 years ago    what is that  laundry shack  whos doing laundry  not mewere not supposed to use the dryer  it drains too much energy and our generators messed up    it doesnt mean anything she could be fine  billys right  maybe she was painting a fire engine and decided to go for a swim  this is not paint shawn  who could do something like this  anybody for the toothless old guy on the rusty schwinn  you mean the janitor  janitor  take a look around i really dont think youre getting your moneys worth  crazy old erwen  erwen wouldnt hurt a fly  would anybody like some tea  maybe something black  you dont have to decide now ill just put some on  okay what is that about  tea isnt the worst idea ever  its a great stress reducer  this cycle just started  which means whoever did this is close  i say we go looking for her  clive  define looking for her  because i dont really feel like losing any of my extremities  we stay within shouting distance  we meet back at the office at 600  nobodys one minute late you got me  lets twist this  you guys arent gonna let me go alone are you   of course not  yes we are  we were actually thinking of staying here in the laundry shack  really scoping this place out with a finetooth comb  please gus  annie could be out there somewhere  i hear you  shes right shawn annie needs us  excuse him  weve never met annie she could be a terrible person  weve suddenly fallen into some kind of slasher movie scenario  and were making all the classic mistakes  we stay here shut the door wait for help  at least take something pointy   annie  annie  itll be okay sissy  im sure theres a perfectly logical explanation for all of this  oh no there isnt  but i appreciate your attempt to put me at ease  i am literally shaking over here  dont worry  they call me fearless guster  i  and theres plenty more where that came from  annie  annie  somebody there  cause im right here  hello  may i help you sir  i certainly hope so  i have a reservation under carlton lassiter and spouse  your reservation is for 700 pm   thats right  its 520  yeah well  parking wasnt quite the rattlesnake i had anticipated  well sir none of our wait staff has arrived as of yet  but i can assure you the table will be ready at 700 sharp  ill wait  youregoing to stand here  im a peace officer im practiced in surveillance  i can remain motionless for up to eight hours if need be  the bar is also open if youd prefer to sit  oh thats good too  victoria  i was kind of nervous so i got here early  me too  hello  shawn  jules  you made really good time  shawn are you hiding in that closet  no  no im not thats a negative  how have you been  okay this is weird  heres the thing jules  and i wouldnt possibly have expected you to know this  but sometimes the psychic headlights can get a little bright  and i have to balance that effervescence with dark space  closets are very good  coffins are great  shawn you sounded really spooked on the phone  whats going on  yeah uh solid question and im gonna bring you up to speed  but  first would you mind coming back in  and catching me doing some inverted situps  or perhaps lifting a large anvil over my head  wheres billy  i dont know we split up  well did you find anything  i stumbled upon erwens living quarters and i mean that loosely  gus there you are   look who i found  what the  im clive im hilarious and i have no girlfriend  hi im juliette and im a cop  nice rejection very clean  have you seen billy  no  he said 600 sharp not a minute late  and then he said lets twist this  its ten past  listen if half of what shawn has told me is true  none of you are being very smart  everyone needs to get inside together now  lets go  come on  so you dont really know this jason guy at all  any of you  i cant believe i let him talk me into this  careful sissy   you of all people should  forget that enough is enough  jason wasnt completely honest with you guys he  cant imagine what you were about to say sissy  cant even imagine   who is she  detective ohara  one of santa barbaras finest both literally and figuratively  judas  pardon me  no cops  you gave me your word spencer  you ruined everything  look jason we have bloodsoaked pajamas in the dryer  and now billys missing too  i think its safe to say that there is a clear and present  danger here  im finished  i cant open the camp now  not now  listen jason i am not the enemy here  i think we all just need to stay together  nobody had to know  i could have fixed this  you destroyed me  iago  what does the parrot from aladdin have to do with this  hes not well we cant just let him go out there all by himself  all right  no you stay here with us  shes right you stay here with sissy and clive  gus and i will bring jason back  this is our case hes our responsibility  you must be out of your mind if you think for one second im going out there  ive seen enough slasher movies to know that when the brother goes off to the woods  he doesnt even sorta come back  sorry  ll cool j made it all the way through deep blue sea  that was in the water shawn with sharks  and sam jacksons ass still got swallowed whole  fine ill go alone  i dont like this shawn  well your hands are a little bit tied arent they  plus when you showed up i was hiding in a closet  so i figure im due to man up  if im not back in exactly four minutes please go looking for me  but really start giving it some serious thought after two  and if you think that theres anything even slightly amiss after 45 seconds  youre the leader here  i told you we never should have come back to this place  jason  dude we took a vote  staying in the house and not wandering around the woods won  its pretty much unanimous  aw man we can totally do laundry in the morning  annie  are you okay  are you okay  are you okay  annie  uhh  drop it or i will shoot you where you stand  no dont shoot  i have the shot  dont shoot  shawn what are you doing  this isnt friday the 13th  its april fools day  same formula  but with a killer twist ending  you  almost had me  your humble servant my lord  bravo  wow mr cunningham  bravo  you did it shawn  you really are something special  what the  detective please forgive me you  you so were not supposed to be here  somebody tell me whats going on right now  in a nutshell  jasons reopening camp tikihama all right  but its not for the kiddies  i mean take a look around he didnt even refill the swimming pool  no hes got something much darker in mind  a murder camp  its like those mystery train things  but way way cooler  every other week eight people pay to have  the bejesus scared out of them  and solve a onceinalifetime whodunit murder mystery  i needed a rehearsal heh  and you two were in on this  only the setup  the dry run jason started caught me by surprise  scared me senseless  but whoa what a rush  we all knew about the camp but we had no idea that we were gonna be  his little guinea pigs this week  it was so weird  i could sense that there had been a struggle in the kitchen  its me its me  its okay its okay  im sorry im sorry  quite a mess but somebody  somebody covered it up  thats amazing  how did you know it wasnt real  well im a psychic jason theres no reliable defense for that  i could feel that nothing was what it seemed  but i couldnt have done it without gus  you were right partner  that wasnt paint on annies clothes  paint dries so does blood  but corn syrup mixed with red dye number three  not so much  thats how we do it  yin and yang  im the spark that starts the fire  of course that probably wouldnt have occurred to me  if you hadnt wiped it all over your pants  buddy  you see my best friend cant stand the sight of blood  hes even fainted on occasion  thats not true  whai dont believe you you were in on all this  well jason called me a week ago  and i figured this was the perfect chance  to get shawn back for an entire lifetime of scaring the daylights out of me   killer b  what  so history repeats itself  you two are my least favorite tag team of all time  really with iron sheik and nikolai volkoff on the table  wow  you just made that reference  well ill tell you what let me start the apology train  there is champagne on ice inside  maybe strawberries  we should go inside  one two three  thank you very much  come on jules try to have some fun  were not being chased around by an axewielding maniac anymore  its kind of a sick little charade and been a colossal waste of my time  butsince its not a crime to be distasteful  maybe i can hang out till the storm passes  i think i saw some chocodiles in the fridge  tempting   i shall return  hmm  crazy old man what have you done to yourself  if youre trying to make it up to the mountains this weekend  good luck  highway 17 has been completely blocked by an overturned logging truck  ugh perfect  the wind probably brought down the only tower we had in the area  ill radio for an ambulance  dont bother  they wont be coming and we wont be going  not tonight the road is completely blocked  of course it is  a uh confidante told me not too brazen  and then i realized that i should proceed with caution   thats exactly my problem  i never took any chances  i didnt seize the moment i never  let my emotions carry me i analyzed it all to death  prprotecting myself  or protecting something i dont even know what it is  but thats why were here   mmhmm  in this place  causei wanna restart  i want a second chance at a first impression  sohere is something  from the guy with nothing to protect  heart on sleeve hat in hand  oh god  dont say anything  justjust put it on it is long overdue  no this is  its just too much  well ive been working some overtime lately  and sold some confiscated knives on craigslist  and of course that stimulus check that certainly helped  theres been a a big mistake  what  is it  did i do something  no its me  i think um  i think that i was not very clear about my intentions  when i said that i needed to meet with you  what is this  its our divorce papers  nobody is to touch that body  i can justify moving it because of the storm  but until further notice that porch is off limits  do we know what happened to him  its impossible to tell before an autopsy  but there are no clear signs of foul play that i can see  well he certainly didnt strike me as much of a swimmer  his trailer doesnt have any running water  he bathes in the lake  ugh still nothing  i want to know the second any of you can use your phones  i guess this kills the game of strip cribbage  that i was trying to start  no lets do it anything to get my mind off this day  come on gus  jason youre playing too  whatever you say my dear  come on clive you know you want some of this action  no thanks i got weird nipples  though it does seem appropriate to play a game  with a dead guy on the porch  i got a date in the den with the moon patrol  what about you annie you in  umno  i want the rest of this muck off my neck i want a hot shower  uh annie where do you think youre going  away from the animals  dont worry you dont need to babysit me okay  ill just be in my cabin  regretting the decision to take this job in the first place  jules may i have a word please  something still feels off  im getting some pretty strong vibes that erwen didnt have the big one  while he was exfoliating his armpits  cant you do better than vibes  jeff goldblum and cyndi lauper couldnt  how bout you let me have an honest look at that body  all right  hes a little nicked up but the current carried him pretty far  so it could be anything  no touching shawn  didnt need to be said  anything  its not clear  not yet  strip cribbage my ass  jason you jerk  that is not funny at all  get out of here  jason  aah  what is that now four in a row  this is nuts  you still have on your shoes and socks  do you even know how this game works  oh  wow  boybilly  i will give you everything in guss wallet  if you put your pants back on  dude please cover your junk  probably just a breaker  back in a flash  you guys arent afraid of the dark are you  thank you  carlton  lets not  you know this has been coming for a long time  honestly lets just skip this part  i signed em while you were in the bathroom  really  two years ago you would have thrown them in the fire  no two years ago i would have lit them on fire  and put them back in your purse  i dont think this place likes me very much  i dont think ill ever stop loving you  not completely  say something  whenyou first left me  i may have had you followed  and called your cell phone  butthat doesnt matter  its not about the past anymore  its about tomorrow  so im not gonna say a word  but know that i want to  i wanna scream to the sky that i would do anything to get you back  but im going to let you go  because thats what you want  once you walk out that door  im gonna let go of everything ive been holding onto  so we can both have tomorrow  goodbye victoria  goodbye carlton  stupid breaker  jason you scared the crap out of me  dude  finally  shawn  i stumbled upon erwens living quarters  and i mean that loosely  clive  shawn whats going on  i think we have a very serious problem  what the hell is this  what the  clive killed erwen  i dont know why but he did  and now hes out there and so are billy and annie  listen to me very carefully  i want you all to stay together in the living room  dont open the door for anybody but me   im coming too  no   we can cover more ground this way  shawn  were not discussing this theres no time   shawn  buddy  itll be okay  im gonna

fiance  what  i just wanted to say thank you  for shooting that whack job psycho killer in the hand  my pleasure  and i know this probably sounds weird  but even though i was really scared and discombobulated and whatnot  that level of pinpoint marksmanship from you  is easily one of the sexiest things that ive ever  shawn  shh  okay  how could something so ugly happen here  just doesnt make any sense  last looks gus  itll be a cold day in hell before we  im sorry i ditched you and made a pinata with jason cunningham  apology accepted
