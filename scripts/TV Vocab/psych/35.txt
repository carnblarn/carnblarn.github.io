quick  i just need to respond omg lol  heres a question  how do you make the face thats winking  with the tongue coming out one side  mr spencer now by my estimation  you may be in some serious trouble here  so i am only going to ask you this once  wheres the gold  its not quite as simple as that  right if we were to really answer that question  wed have to go back quite a while  how long  about 20 years  as the rain thundered down from the dark night sky  and 30foot waves crashed over his ship  the great pirate bouchard stood on his bow  pointed  at the california coast and yelled  we shall take this land as ours men  your dads awesome  i know  im so glad my dad didnt come  i mean i dont even know  what a manager of debt consolidation does anyways  except drink  rumor has it that bouchard was obsessed  with searching for spanish gold  they also say he may have had syphilis  and went crazy searching for something  that never existed  but i say  the gold did exist  okay my dad has to go now  thanks dad see you later bye  wh wh what the hecks going on here  officer were just in the middle of a class  is there a problem with something  yes there is a problem  thats not shawns dad cause im shawn spencers father  youre not shawns dad  uh well uh you know technically  uh technically that is my brother jack  who technically didnt tell me he was coming to town  and obviously cooked up this ruse with shawn  to fool his new teacher  what were you thinking  i dont know i just thought itd be cooler if uncle jack spoke  look class im sorry to break this to you but  hes not a real treasure hunter and this  is not real gold  kids my big brother henry is absolutely right  this is not real gold  but it is real chocolate  what does this have to do with the gold  relax lassidophilus were getting there  last night  what can i say the movie didnt make any sense  of course it didnt make any sense to you  you came in 20 minutes late fell asleep for an hour  then woke up

the only 8yearold kid who knew what a trifecta meant   yeah  uncle jack i havent heard from you  since you sent that email from prince alberts boat  in the maldives  yeah well i had to sign a confidentiality agreement there guys  cant really talk about it  ooh by the way i got presents for everybody  i got these when i was excavating near machu picchu  dug them up myself  its been three years jack  what are you doing here besides breaking into my house  breaking in you gave me a key henry  i didnt give you a key  i dont give anyone keys not even shawn  oh thats not true i actually made a copy a while back  it was when i was hooked on wow wow wubbzy on noggin  i didnt have cable  oh i also stole your toilet paper  for about a year and a huge box of sporks  oh  i guess you are wondering why i came back  i want you to help me find bouchards treasure  come on not that again jack  i hate to break it to you little brother  but bouchards treasure does not has not  and will not ever exist  its a pipe dream  dont listen to him uncle jack  hes a dream killer  ah i understand his frustration  all those years spent listening to me drone on  about the whole treasure thing  without even a semblance of proof  i get it  one thing confuses me though  if it is just a figment of my imagination  whered i get this  asiateamtv  presents  psych s03e04 the greatest adventure in the history of basic cable   why do i feel like he can see us  no its impossible he cant see or hear a thing  thats just weird  so what were just gonna let this guy listens in on everything  its out of our hands detective  now just get in there and get to the bottom of this  you got it  when are we gonna find out the deal with suit guy in there  lets just get back to the story  i cant believe your uncle jack actually had a treasure map  i cant believe you actually pretended your uncle was your dad  i wanted gus dad to do it  but there was a genealogy issue i just couldnt resolve  what else can you tell us about the bouchard guy  we could only remember bits and pieces  of the bouchard myth but jack  filled us in on the rest  november 1818  bouchard sailed up and down the california coast  searching desperately for the mythical spanish gold  he ravaged and looted the mission in monterrey  was repelled at san juan capistrano  and finally made land here at santa barbara  where he did battle with a small spanish garrison  and the chumash indians  yeah i remember reading about that  they say he made off with millions in spanish gold coins  but his boat sunk off the coast north of here  he disappeared and years later he showed up in argentina  superior retention of historic detail gus  bouchard was also fond of hiding clues  to the treasures whereabouts in the map  and i stumbled upon this one while researching him in argentina  first you say youre in machu picchu in peru  and all of a sudden now youre in argentina  so which one is it  dad hes not a suspect  hes suspect all right  forget him forget him okay  my big brothers always been just a little cynical  and thats what i love about him  you still havent answered my question  what about it boys   want to be treasure hunters  are you kidding me  thats like asking me if i want my own jet pack  or if ive ever wanted to be a koala bear  okay i think he means yes you can count him in  and me too  superb mm  you know ive been uh reading a lot about that detective stuff you do  and it seems to me that having a psychic  might be a real asset  who knew i had one in my own family  well uncle jack i  i dont know im not really  i wouldnt necessarily say psychic  stop that right now  dont you do that to yourself young man  do not sell yourself short  do not feel embarrassed just cause youre a little different  didnt i always tell you youd be great didnt i  yeah you did  okay now heres the plan  everything we find we split 5050  thats after we donate most of it to a museum right   we are so gonna do that gus  right  you and i were really up here in synch  okay so the first thing we need to do is  get matching fedoras  get matching fedoras  youre the one who wanted the fedoras not me  stop changing the story  my mistake he wanted the yellow gauchos  i said no to that  would you please put me in a separate room from these idiots  i will tell you everything  just continue  jack had told us to meet him at the front steps of the mission  because that was the first step on the map  gus and i could barely contain our excitement  i contained mine a little better  okay just follow my lead  say yes to everything  oh welcome welcome im karen raven  head of the santa barbara historical society  we are delighted to have such a distinguished professor  as yourself visiting us  ah gracias

uncle jack whats really going on here  my research has told me there are clues  about the treasures whereabouts hidden somewhere in this room  and it all has to do with the number 152  why dont we just use the map  well technically theres uh  something i havent told you about the whole map  uncle jack this is a pretty big thing to leave out  yeah i know i know i know its a long story  a onelegged woman bottle of cutty sark  the point is that the missing part of the map  is the first step of the hunt  now come on kid use that psychic gift you got  come on  oh boy  i im seeing letters

stock at home depot  uh what else  there was something else oh i know  if youre not too busy gus jack and i  are tied up in a cabin about  100 yards off tunnel road right by where we had the pulled pork sandwiches that one time  shawn  spencer are you gonna answer my question or not  how did your dad know where to find you  with some people i can communicate through psychic wavelengths  my father is one of them  val kilmer is another  heres something i dont understand  jacks partner wanted the map right  so why would they trash your dads house  they know jack wouldnt let the map out of his sight  mark and his men they werent looking for a map  so what were they looking for  you know youre my boy shawn  whyd you have to go and give mark the map  because i dont need it  uncle jack trust me  i can recreate the map psychically in my head  spare me kid okay  you cant snow the snowman  we were so close  stop  i feel jittery  it starts with beans  gus likes it in the morning  now he has gas  something having to do with coffee  yes coffee  coffee coffee coffee coffee table  coffee table  mark and his goons werent looking for the map were they  no no they were looking for something else  a different piece of the puzzle  something you didnt want connected to the map at all  that is downright scary  maybe you really do have a gift kid  my bad for doubting it  now this key is also from bouchards stuff  i found in argentina  it was useless without that map  but if shawn can actually recreate that map  that plus this key means we are back on track  guys i got to hit the head  but when i come back we are finding us a treasure  hope he bought that  with jack you never know  yeah yeah yeah yeah  but if that key is real  shawn come on take a look around  havent you had enough these guys  they destroyed my living room  mark and his goons arent gonna stop  we got to get back out there dad  no  no shawn no  just come with us come with us  why do you need me  its not that we need you  we want you  plus we need you  we need your truck because  my car is still at the lighthouse  and mark has the key  there you go thank you very much  sorry count me out  shocker   okay guys ready  good  all we got to do now is borrow a car  now technically the term is hotwiring  however  im in but i drive  im the one who decides if and when we go to the police  i dont want any more surprises  do you understand  yes dad  big bro i knew youd come around  okay psychic  whats the next step  shawn  the key will guide us now  i love this  between me and you guys  no more surprises right jack  of course  ya los tenemos  tell me this shawn  how are we supposed to find clues from a bell tower  that hasnt been around for over 100 years  the presidio was huge  it wouldve taken up several blocks  so what should we do now  theres only one thing we can do  go back in time  the bell tower is calling me   shawn  come on  shawn wait up  shawn  this is it  this is where the bell tower stood  what do we do now  lets buy some mufflers  he doesnt even own a car  i bet you i end up paying for this  you all right  yeah yeah ill survive  what are we doing up here shawn  im not sure yet  thats part of the fun isnt it  we are good to go  the manager said we can take as much time as we need  alvin good guy  filipino  they love me  and jack offered him  i also gave him an 82 penny  it was the first year they used zinc instead of copper  okay what is the deal with you and all these pennies  yeah i dont get that either  so jack collects them and then leaves them places   whats that about  jack was always interested in history  collecting pennies was his way of being a part of it  but leaving the pennies was his own personal philosophy  see uncle jack always said  i leave the penny because its good luck  and lord knows the world could use more good luck  are you for real  all right shawn what are we doing up here  you think that when bouchard captured the fort  he stood up here on the bell tower gazing out into the big blue ocean  looking for a place to hide the treasure  if i were a french pirate  with a bad temper and at least one venereal disease  where would i be looking  thats it  thats it right there  were so close lets go  hey  how did he find us  hes got the map he mustve figured it out  come on lets go  shawn shawn  i cant leave my puma shawn  i got it  this is it  this is the bluff on the map  uncle jack  i know this probably isnt the right time to say this  but dude i think were gonna get to ride in a helicopter  youre obligated to let me speak with them  im not obligated to make  chief perhaps you should see this one more time  no i dont need to see the letter one more time  jules lassie whats going on out there  whats the deal with that guy  he didnt say a word to us when he brought us in  his name is andres candelaria  he works for the spanish government  apparently hes part of some intergovernmental task force  on stolen antiquities  hello mr spencer  i believe you know why youre here  and i believe you know i know why im here  now why am i here  to help us find the treasure that rightly belongs to my government  but we didnt find anything  si and my men have been searching the bluffs all night as well with no luck  thats because you stopped us one step short  your treasures not in the bluffs che  the spirits are guiding my man paw  its like its like that movie idle hands  except with no nudity  which means i must be completely unwatchable right now  do either of these words mean anything to anyone  it could be the clue were looking for  cueva is spanish for cave   couleur could be french  i think it means paint   i spent a semester in paris  got salmonella poisoning and lost 20 pounds  best night ever  painted caves thats it  bouchard was french but he was fascinated with the chumash indians  chumash indians  well they used to paint caves all over the area  we used to roust punks in there from drinking all the time  roust punks  thank you jack lord  we will now lead you to the treasure  i know the cave  very well lets go  stop you are not doing this  the only reason i brought these men here in the first place  was because spencer would not talk with us unless he was in the station  okay look i said we would cooperate with you  but they are employees of the sbpd  and theyre not going anywhere without my detectives  chief we have been through this no  this is from your treasury department  giving me full power to call the shots  now i thank you for your help  but it will no longer be needed  vamos  sorry  i cant believe were actually digging for buried treasure  i know dude and youre getting your pants totally dirty and you dont even care  im so proud of you  keep digging  h b  that could be for hippolyte de bouchard   no  no that does that doesnt make any sense  just get it out  oh my god  its real  si  well done  buen trabajo  you should know the spanish government owes you a great debt of gratitude  now  could i please have the coins  before we do that  i should tell you  i know three things that you probably dont know  uno  the secret of nimh and the secret of my success  same secret  dos  i know that you  dont work for the spanish government  and tres  these caves are actually quite slippery   what are you doing  grab that grab that  right there  what is going on  why are we running  why did we leave the caves  shawn shawn  what happened to your other puma  you got to be kidding me  i lost another shoe  come on  this way  vamos   jack  jack  yes  hey

no you you always have a choice  you could ransom guss ass you could swirl it up  you could ransom half my ass and half his ass  drop it  hands in the air  shawn you know i dont curse very often  so when i do you know i mean it  what the hell just happened  i thought you werent a big fan of the wrapup  all right ill give it to you  so back at the station i realize andres accent isnt spanish  its argentinean  and thats where uncle jack just got back from  so i figure hes one of jacks partners  how did you know that  you worked at that winery in argentina for a year  i kept the postcards  you did  i use em as beer coasters  okay shawn wh  so thats why i called andres che  to see if hed react which he did  because in argentina che is slang for buddy or pal  sort of like i call you black star  or home skillet or big baby burton    dont ever call me home skillet   right  but why didnt you tell anybody  i did  she knew just what to do with it  ooh sorry jules  andres is not real follow

someone who wasnt gonna show  all right look shawn heres the thing about your uncle jackie  hell always come back  youre not the first to get duped you certainly wont be the last  welcome to the club kid  i guess i probably owe you an apology  i can see now where uncle jack might not has been the best role model  yeah maybe not  why didnt you say anything when i was a kid  because i always wanted you  to have the the fun uncle in your life  i was only hard on you because i didnt want your life to turn out  like the fun uncle  well it didnt  not totally   here you go  thanks  you know the penny thing  your grandpa taught me that and then i taught it to jack when we were kids  he just took it to another whole level  yeah he uh he seems to do that a lot  i still cant believe that he got away with the gold  i you got to think that someday  all this stuff is gonna catch up with him huh  yeah  and that day might just be today  does gus know about this  oh yeah hes got the rest of it  dont worry were donating it to the museum  all of it  ish   i saw jack following us  i knew he was gonna show up in the car  i made the switch when we were running through the forest  so what does jack have  well done shawnie  oh well done
