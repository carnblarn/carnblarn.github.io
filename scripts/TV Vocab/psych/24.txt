considered armed and dangerous   excuse me sir  yes  how did he manage to escape  what are you writing a movie script about this  why dont you focus on the facts im giving you instead of compiling your own  you know what detective i got this  it was my fault  tancana was in my custody at the time  i was escorting him from holding to the courthouse  he was cuffed but not leg shackled  one of the uniformed officers that was following us stopped to tie his shoe  i should have lagged back but i didnt  we rounded a blind corner he took the opportunity to head butt me  making a run for it while i

knowing that myself detective lassiter  and the entire department are doing everything they can to bring tancana back into custody  oh i think youve already done your part  and that was allowing my wifes killer to escape  now maybe you can just step aside and let mr tatums do what he does  all do respect sir what we did was apprehend the man  arrest him and charge him with murder  yeah hows that

can turn in tancana  how  its not like we have 50000 in a briefcase somewhere   nice buddy  what  what  so are you planning on letting me in any time soon on what your plan is from here  gus you dont want this to be a repeat of the time  i told you what happened at the end of war games  you didnt talk to me for a week  just wait its better whats in there anyway  a bunch of expire deczema swabs  its all i could find in the back of your car  yo byrd  ah spencer what a surprise  yeah im chock full of em   hey what are you doing right now  oh right now  im about 30 seconds away from collecting 50000 bucks  thats what im doing  ooh 50000  nice thats very exciting  thats a lot of shot glasses that say byrd on them  get to the point spencer and make it fast  well maybe you didnt know this  but theres a whole lot of money stashed away from the robbery  yeah tancana told us where it was  and now all that money is in my briefcase  is this a briefcase or an attache  i think its a briefcase attaches have a softer shell  really thats all that differentiates them a softer shell  well attache does have a better ring to it  lets go with attache  get to it spencer  look you said this was your last hurrah right  why not make it a really really fat one  well trade you whats in the attache for tancana straight up  winwin  now would i wanna do that  because whats in the attache attache sounds pretentious dude  well it could be the way youre saying it   you say it  attache  whats in the briefcase is four times more than what coles gonna pay you  and for those of you playing along at home thats 200000  so why wouldnt you take the money you allergic  no we love money particularly gus  but this time were not doing it for the money  were doing it for the girl  you know what shawn lets get out of here  this guy wouldnt know a good deal if it bit him in the seat of his han solo action figure pants  no wait wait wait wait wait  wait  fine toss me the money  you think this is my first moneyforhostage exchange  no  first you give us tancana and then gus tosses you the briefcase  no i wanna see the money first  sure and why dont we just invite the whole police force out to count it for you while were at it   yoohoo  same time byrd  same time  ill count to three  one two three  what the hell is this  that was your big plan really really shawn  no this was the plan  why is he winking at me  its involuntary  you got him thank god  what kind of an idiot pulls a gun in front of a police station  drop it byrd  i have a license to carry  im licensed to arrest  now as much as ive thought about shooting these two from time to time  you cannot pull a gun on innocent civilians  so drop it  down on your knees hands behind your head  lets take you inside to cool off bounty hunter  pass me the satchel  ooh satchel i didnt think of that one  i think things are gonna go a little differently this time  lets go  thank you im sorry i doubted you guys  its okay we all make mistakes  what do you think buddy how about that nap  shawn are you forgetting something i know you need a nightlight  shawn  oh right  whoa guys hold up hold up  sorry with the whole guns drawn thing  and all the screaming and byrds ridiculous feathery hair  i forgot to tell you you got the wrong guy  and its not just a murder its a double murder   what the hell are you talking about  its cole its loman cole  he must have been planning on murdering his wife  because he used the breakin as the perfect opportunity to strangle her  and pin it on tancana a career criminal who would go down easy right  i have no idea what youre talking about  he even knocked himself out with a vase to sell the breakin  because you cant be blamed for murder when youre unconscious  what you didnt know was that tancana wasnt alone in the house that night  his partner delbecchio was on the second floor and hes the one who actually saw you  he stole the necklace off your dead wifes body may she rest in peace  so he contacted you told you that he saw you kill your wife  and blackmailed you in exchange for his silence  delbecchio kept talking about working something bigger  blowing about all the cash he was gonna make  you paid him once  but then he wanted more  so you set up a dropoff at the meadow parking garage  and thats where you applied the old cole specialty move  the strangle  and you might have gotten away with it if it wasnt for your own greediness  what greediness i have all the money i need  not greediness for money greediness for fabulous hair  unlike your poor defenseless wife delbecchio fought back  oh i can see it i can see it very clearly now  but mostly mostly i can smell it  all over delbecchios hands  smell what  who smells ginger blossoms   i do  its unmistakable  its hair gel  kangaroo paste  trust me if you swab delbecchios hands and coles hair  youll see that he was there  psychic bullcrap huh   do you have an alibi  i dont need an alibi im not guilty  oh well thats okay  cause we can just look at the security cameras from the parking garage   there were no cameras in that parking gara  oh  cuff him detective ohara  got some questions for you in the interrogation room  i uh guess that takes care of everybody  okay tancana you may have beaten the murder rap  but youre gonna do some time for that robbery and that escape  well robbery over murder thats better right  what are you guys pals now  im sorry to break up this tender moment  but dont think im not gonna be really looking closely into the crap  you two must have pulled in the last 14 hours  you know when you reprimand us you might try using your feeling voice  yeah   otherwise all we hear is  the vest looks good  shut up  shawn  look i really screwed up today  and i just wanna say thank you for being there for me  it really meant a lot  it was a mistake  thats what friends are for  yeah  well its been a long day  well i guess you have to get home and feed your parrot  shawn i dont have a parrot  well in that case  shawn what are you doing   nothing  really  because if youre doing what it looks like youre doing  its gonna be one of those things we were just talking about   whats that  a mistake  i agree but thats clearly not what were doing  okay really  what do you say that were doing  i call it very close talking  ah i see  do you have anything else to say  mm no  i think im good for now  well good night  night detective
