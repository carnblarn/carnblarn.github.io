                dad why do this people get better seats than us   shawn those people arent just watching the trial  those people are the trial theyre the jurors  and they are the most important people in this room  they are   the thing about the jury is shawn  you got to learn how to look at them how to read them  for instance  take a look at juror number five  hes the guy in the front row second one from the left  tell me what you see  go  brown shirt little hole in his collar  his coat is too tight on him  hes got rough hands hes looking down mostly and nodding a lot  well good lets take that hole in his collar  now would mom ever let you leave the house looking like that  never  you believe it  so that tells us that hes probably not married  thats called deductive reasoning  your honor the people call detective henry l spencer to the stand  all right watch closely kid  one day youre going to walk up the steps of this courthouse  youre going to make your old man proud  gus they impounded my motorcycle without warning  im pretty sure the warning was the 900 worth of parking tickets you racked up  still you cant take a mans meansof transportation away   its unconstitutional or something  im pretty sure its not in the constitution  oh dont be so sure  i think it says  thou shalt not something or covet something  dont mess with texas or the right of transportation  youre thinking of a commandment  thats even better  can we just pay this ticket so we can get out of here please  youve got to be kidding me  we came all the way over here and now youre not going to wait in the line   gus did you see it in there  its a ticket payment line not space mountain  hardly worth it  plus i dont wait in lines  what do you mean you dont wait in lines   everyone waits in lines thats all we do as people  we wait in lines  i dont its not in my nature  that makes no sense shawn  you remember the story of the scorpion and the frog  theyre both on the river bank   the scorpions and  burton guster  the point is i shouldnt have gotten any tickets gus  i was using my ambassador plates  ambassador plates  youre not an ambassador shawn  impersonating a government official will land you in jail  i am an ambassadorof sorts  i am a goodwill ambassador to paraguay  to where paraguay  it is an honorary title that i received after overseeing all sand castle construction at a south american club med  you never worked at club med  ooh turn that up  someone we know someone we love  someone we invited into our living rooms i just saw that woman at the courthouse  thats sandra panitch the fourth grade teacher who murdered jackson hale  dont you watch the news  i cant watch channel 8 anymore  lloyd lansing wears a toupee  its like every newscast starts with a lie  i cant stand this guy  something about him just irks me listen to him  sandra panitch went with weatherman jackson hale to his channel 8 news studio  engaged in sexual relations with him  and then stabbed him in the heart with a letter opener  she fled the scene  but not without leaving behind  a mountain of physical evidence including a trail of the victims blood  and her fingerprints all over the murder weapon  this is why the state is going after murder one   but she didnt do it  what  gus im getting a very strong feeling here  i think that woman is innocent  i do watch the news and following this case  they have a mountain of evidence against this lady  look they call her the school marm murderer  first of all theres a question mark at the end of that  they call her the school marm murderer   even the newspeople arent convinced  and today at the courthouse in the middle of a conversation  i saw her bend over and pick up a piece of trash  i see so because she picks up somebodys kit kat wrapper means she didnt kill anybody    that makes sense  gus  she didnt have to do that  the woman is about to be on trial for her life  she takes time out for common courtesy   that is not the mindset of a coldblooded murder  no  this is what i know  she looked at me right in the eyes  now  there are a lot of tells that people have when they are trying to appear not guilty  the way that they sit  crossing their legs uncrossing them crossing them back  eye lines to inanimate objects twitching itching rubbing  all of these affectations i am an expert on all of them  but theres one thing that you cannot change  no matter how hard you try  and that is the tint on the windows to the soul  adam hornstock attorney for the defense  sandra panitch is a victim of circumstance  of being in the wrong place at the wrong time  oh no  look at this poor guy  look hes hunched over hes not making eye contact  and look at the handkerchief in the left pocket there its not decorative  gus

innocent  now can we please go before jarecki gets back  carter jarecki just left for a nooner with his mistress we have at least two hours  maybe an hour and a half  hornstock i think you have the potential to be a fantastic lawyer  you just need confidence after all thats your name on the door  now come on  oh no  no none of those hornstocks are me  the first one is my grandfather  he founded

several of hales coworkers from channel 8  mostly to refute time lines and for character testimony   can we see those   sure yeah heres  oh yes  and maybe later on we can read the phone book just for fun  hornstock  i have got to do what i do  thats not the way i do it  i need to see feel and smell people in order to figure out what happened  smell them  so this is where the uh  the crime took place  so just feel free to have a look around so do  whatever it is you do   yeah  thank you   lets walk the crime shall we   yeah  probably came in from that same entrance we did  found their way

i got it  okay so we just have to go to the control room its just this way  okay  you know when were watching the weather guy and it looks like hes got  like rainfall behind him  or snow or hail    how does that work      well the green background works as a blank slate  then i just run it through the board  and presto  a composite of the two images is made  oh oh oh can we get sound in here   yeah yeah sure  in local news  a pharmaceutical representative again provided the key piece of information in a baffling police case  but ran screaming from the scene like a little girl before he could make a statement  that was one time shawn  one time   i dont like dead bodies i told you that  now stop bringing that up  hello this is your local news  this next office was jackson hales  i got to tell you guys everybodys been acting a little weird since it happened  its just not the same  ruben  this is shawn spencer and burton guster theyre working on jackson hales case  this is ruben leonard hes a lab meteorologist on jacksons team  was  i was just  sorting and packing some of his  more important things to send to his family  its the least i can do  thats very thoughtful  thank you   excuse me  sure sure sure  did you work with jackson hale long  six years  he was a great man  i had a lot of respect for him  he was just so good at what he did  a broadcasting treasure  yeah  dude rubens in there destroying hales awards  what yeah  unless hes really offended by the shoddy engraving on the plaque  that guy hates jackson hale im not saying he did it but  reasonable doubt anyone  okay ms panitch  please walk us through the night of the crime  well  i never met mr hale before that night  i just moved here from wisconsin  it wasnt like i was a fan of his i only vaguely knew he was a weatherman  so we talked and he was charming  so the scratches on jackson hales back and his skin under your fingernails  this all happened during the sex  as well as the bruises on your arm  it got passionate  i dont remember anything until i woke up the next morning  with his blood on you   and then you fled to the parking lot   look i was scared  i i know how bad all of this looks i do  but i swear i did not murder anyone  do you guys believe me   do you   of course we do sandra dont be ridiculous  counselor yes  would you please retire with me to the hallway where we can exchange words in hushed tones   okay what are you doing   you are supposed to be demonstrating confidence and swagger for hornstock  what   instead youre poking holes in our case and youre scaring our defendant  here are the facts shawn  all we know about sandra is what she has told us  i think we need to do some investigating  i believe her hornstock believes her what else do we need   we need proof shawn  look right here in this book  corey vs bolevicker in 1955  the key piece of evidence was halfmelted candlesticks  we need evidence where are our candlesticks shawn    maybe you just jumped over them  what   be nimble  be quick   youre not going to give me anything for that   now can we please  check out the judge  hes grabbing his back no wonder hes so grumpy  hes not grabbing his back hes grabbing his kidneys  he probably has a kidney stone   dude nice  thank you  please state to the court what your relationship with mr hale was  it was professional he was my boss i was his receptionist  and as the channel 8 receptionist ms osterman  if people were to call jackson hale  you took those calls   i did  and did you receive any calls from the defendant  sandra panitch at any time   oh not to my knowledge no  but other women would call   sure  was jackson hale sleeping with these women   objection your honor hearsay  ill allow the question  uh well i can only say that i fielded many calls  and sometimes i helped to juggle these calls  he was a handsome man  he certainly was  thank you ms osterman  you may step down ms osterman  thanks  your honor the state requests a moment to prepare for our next witness  he certainly was   what happened  you were rolling  i dont know i dont know  it sounded good in my head  you have a great support system you know it gives you that easy confidence  but my father hasnt been to court once not one of my trials  youve been here one day your fathers already here  what are you talking about   no i met him outside hes a really nice guy  your honor  the defense would like to call for a recess  excuse me  who are you  im sorry your honor my name is shawn spencer im a psychic legal consultant   on this case  objection your honor  we were not made aware that a psychic was hired on this case  approach the bench  all of you  its okay  your honor the people question his validity  okay first of all thats hurtful  look i know youre the big bad prosecutor with the sweet head  but is this tone really necessary  no  i am a legitimate consultant  i have been hired often by the santa barbara police department  and there is a highranking detective  in this very courtroom right now who will vouch for my validity  who is this   hes right there  the wispy yet commanding irish fellow  who looks like hes been sucking on sour patch kids  would you stand and state your name for the court   carlton lassiter santa barbara police department your honor  head detective  perhaps youd like to inform the court of your favorite color as well  the point is do you know this man   i do  and has he worked on cases for the department   he has  there you have it  and he was helpful  absolutely  did he just say absolutely with a little halfsmile  id like that printed out  please im thinking of shellacking it on a nice piece of maple  maybe doing a little decoupage  your honor as you can see im responsible for breaking  many cases here in the state of california  well guess what i dont care who you are  or what youve done for the state  i dont believe in that psychic mumbojumbo  and its not welcome in my court  mumbojumbo   oh you poor poor man  no wonder youre  passing a kidney stone can be very stressful  who told you that  i never told anyone  you tell me if im overstepping my bounds but  id like to suggest an old home remedy that did wonders for my aunt delores  you simply gargle with some mineral water  followed up with some raw greens me personally id go with asparagus tips  that way later on  when youre making water  youll know that its working  lets proceed with the trial  okay you got me im startled   what are you doing here  maybe were both psychics  i am serious  occasionally i come down here i sit in on a trial  today i get a phone call  guess whos practicing law now  wait a minute you come down here regularly  thursdays usually   today was just a bonus  my god  you just cant let go can you  you retired too early  not my fault  i didnt ask you to turn in your badge dad  im in here trying to do something  you seem to forget  whose name you got at the end of your letterhead kid  when you use my name  it is my business as well  give me my phone  took you long enough to figure out the kidney stone  let it be noted   that the witness identified the defendant  sandra panitch  as the woman he saw  running through the parking lot  on the night of the murder  has it been authenticated  hey what would phelps need to get authenticated  i dont know  his little collection of green army men  hstock did you just make a joke  i think you did  your witness  does the defense wish to crossexamine  your honor the defense rests  no it doesnt  your honor  the defense may rest  why am i not resting  i have a vibe thats very strong  hatred jealousy  that guy wanted to be a serious weatherman  he has no sympathy for jackson hale whatsoever  wait what you think he did it  no im pretty sure he didnt  but we can plant a seed  johnny applestock  your honor the defense does not rest  mr leonard  you are a meteorologist are you not  yes i am indeed  but not on the air  no not on the air  maybe because you dont have  a meteorologists name  i dont follow  well  correct me if im wrong  but leonard  isnt a term for  any kind of weather  no it is not  so if i was to look up leonard  in say a weather glossary  there would be no definition  no there would not  um excuse me where is this going  yes mr hornstock  where are you going with this  im sorry your honor  its just that every successful weatherman  that i know of  has a real weathermans name  johnny mountain  dallas raines  oh jackson hale for example  okay first of all that wasnt even his real name  precisely  have you ever considered  going by the name of bolt lightning  no   cloudy mcmillan  no  wendy morningdew  thats a womans name  okay look i have a degree  in meteorology  from the university of virginia  i wrote my thesis on bernoullis theorem  of incompressible level flow  and  i was a junior tornado safety captain  for seven years  jackson hale has a degree in what  physical education  from a junior college  he was an embarrassment  he was worthless all right  he was worthless to anyone  who is a real meteorologist  like myself  he shouldve been stabbed in the heart  long ago  objection your honor  its a little late for that  dont you think counselor  thats the kind of confidence im talking about  thats what im talking about  we are on our way to winning this thing  told you  shes kind and shes innocent  just because we had a small victory in court yesterday  doesnt mean were out of the woods  son of a bitch  alligator pumps  i swear i should arrest that weatherman  he clearly stated  it was not going to rain today  you see thats the problem  with what i like to call group thinking  we dont listen to group thinkers   nope  in fact we dont listen to weathermen at all  if youll excuse me  ive really got better things to do  dinner with your cat  ohara you coming  you go ill catch up with you a sec  you know shawn for a psychic  you are missing something right in front of your face  its too bad  you might actually learn something about lassiter  maybe you dont want to  he waxes his back  im going to go now  and shawn i dont care what anyone else says  the pink shirt is working  okay that was cryptic  not really ill be damned  whos detective assi  lassie  its lassiter  he mustve sent some sort of memo to phelps  the question is  why would lassiter send a letter to the das office  dont you ever watch law and order  they tend to work together sometimes  right  so  so go ahead and check the files  and find me that letter  phelps received it on the 7th  ive been through all of them  there are no memos submitting an evidence filed on the 7th  so it didnt get filed  but there is a memo  so whatevers on that memo is clearly worth hiding  and she told you this directly  yes  when i questioned the defendant  she admitted to having sexual relations with the victim  but not to stabbing him  with a letter opener  well she appeared at the time  to be confused and had memory gaps  but she claimed  never to have seen or touched the weapon  even though her fingerprints were all over it  i see  thank you detective lassiter  nothing further  your witness  you sure about this  yes i have a very strong feeling about this letter  first rule of trial law  never ask a question  you dont know the answer to  have i steered you wrong yet  come on  um detective lassiter  did you send a letter to the das office  on the 7th of august  yes i did  and what did it say  uh objection  lack of foundation  ill allow it  go ahead tell the jury what it said  it questioned the defendants motive  that it was very strong you mean  no it questioned  whether i believed the defendant had one at all  the prosecution never submitted  this letter into evidence  so at this point your honor  the defense calls for a mistrial  man this is fun  approach the bench  we may have received the letter  i i cant be sure  we didnt knowingly withhold it  my office is walltowall papers  then go to staples  and buy yourself some new file folders  but until then  you are warned  any new evidence must be submitted  to all parties immediately  do i make myself clear  yes your honor  and in the spirit of that ruling  i would like to submit a new piece of evidence  if this is that willynilly piece of evidence  that you tried to get in in pretrial  ill tell you one more time  i will not admit  any audiovisual evidence  unless its been authenticated  has it been authenticated  its a videotape  we just got our authentication papers  from the lab in sacramento  it is a videotape  of the defendant sandra panitch  murdering the victim jackson hale  judge i argue that this tape should not be admissible  on what grounds  well were citing  unfair surprisery  i still dont understand  why he is in this room  he is nothing but a disruption  maybe someday phelps when youre a judge  which i highly doubt will happen  then you can decide  whos welcome in your chambers  your honor these guys are a part of my team   and i want them here  why  you used to be a good lawyer hornstock  but lets face it  if youve got to resort to hiring this  idiot psychic and his little sidekick  im nobodys sidekick   you pompous ass  gus gus come on  look at you  gus  we are all grown men here  lets just take a beat  lets  lets take a step back  lets take a step back  mr hornstock  having now seen the video in question  i dont think i need to tell you how damaging it is  i strongly suggest at this point  that you consider accepting a plea bargain  for murder two  your honor i will have to review the tape  and confer with my client  ill tell you what hornstock  i will leave murder two on the table  until tomorrow morning  consider that my gift to you  she doesnt realize shes being taped  nope  i dont think this is his first barbecue either  if you know what i mean  this highdef plasma really makes a difference  i can see the beads of sweat on his neck   look at his hair  thats horrible  do any of you make noises like that  his or hers  when she sees this  she will certainly take the deal  im not going to take the deal  if you dont take the deal  you could go away possibly for life  you do realize this  i dont care  im not going to admit  yo something that i didnt do  okay i believe you i believe you  but i watched that tape  and as your attorney i am begging you  take the deal  dont take the deal  what are you doing  youre supposed to be on my side  hornstock i am on your side  i mean not technically  because of the shape of this table  imagine a round table  i wouldve sat somewhere in the middle  okay tomorrow morning  when the jury watches this tape  we will lose this case  this tape is not telling us the whole truth  theres more  i need to take this tape  you just work on your closing arguments  you leave the rest to me  quit pacing shawn  youre making me nervous  i cant afford it dad  i cant afford a guilty verdict  on my record right now i cant  you do realize that youre not a real lawyer right  you dont have a record  its so weird  the prosecution keeps treating this case  like a crime of passion right  but she only knew him for a couple of hours  i ask you how much passion can you muster up for someone  in a couple of hours  yeah well crimes of passion  are rarely about love or sex shawn  theyre closer to revenge sometimes hatred  i would say that your angry meteorologist  is the best suspect youve got going  he didnt do it  yeah i know that shawn but  the point is  you need to find somebody who felt like that  oh dad believe me there are plenty  the guy slept with half of santa barbara  we can put them all on the stand  the problem is that sandra  is the only one that was there  you have a whisk  i do  and youre not looking close enough  well you know what  its tough  when virtually everything imaginable  is stacked against me  ive got your ass staring me down in the courtroom  ive got a defense attorney  who breaks every time the wind blows  ive got to hitch rides every time i need to go somewhere  because get this  theres some rogue meter maid  whos decided to have a ticketing vendetta  against me and my motorcycle  well shawn maybe that might not happen  if you didnt park your bike   outside your apartment  dad youve seen my street  the parking is a joke  how did you know that  oh oh oh how do you know that  wait a second how  how did you know that  look whos paying attention now  you tipped them off  you tipped them off about my bike  who taught you how to drive shawn  who do you represent  every time youre out on that road  i dont represent anybody when i go out on the road  dad they took my bike  tell it to the embassy  i might not be able to get it out of the impound  yeah well then maybe its time for you to consider  a real mode of transportation huh  you will do anything you can  to impose your will on me  you hated that bike  you have always hated that bike  and youve been especially hardass about it since i  since you what shawn  since you what since you had your accident  is that it is that where your old man crossed the line  fine ill tell you what i will back off  im going to lay off man  ill tell you what you do  you take me off your call list  the next time the ambulance picks you up  and brings you in that door  all right fair  get over yourself kid  or at least learn how to park  shawn what are you doing  do you know what time it is  what  what time what time is it  its 900  were late for court  i called you a million times   gus  what  would you say anger is a good motivator   did you see your dad again  yes i did  and i think it actually worked  mr hornstock  your honor the defense has nothing more  uh not so fast  excuse me  call priscilla osterman to the stand  what are you talking about she already testified  can we recall her  yes if we have new information  but i have nothing else to ask her  oh trust me i am feeling all kinds of good stuff here  your honor  the defense calls ms osterman back to the stand   objection  overruled  im giving you the teeniest latitude  providing you have some new evidence to mine here  ms osterman i remind you  that you are still under oath  proceed counselor  ask her if she is absolutely certain  that she did not sleep with jackson hale  ms osterman  are you absolutely certain  you did not sleep with jackson hale  objection your honor  asked and answered in prior testimony  sustained  im not kidding counselor  im giving you one more question  and then im shutting you down  did you want to  objection  this man is not a lawyer  he has no right  to address the witness  actually your honor he can  under rule 775a  of the california state rules of evidence  the rule gives the court wide discretion  over the mode and order  of presenting evidence  effective for the ascertainment of the truth  precedence killmer vs duchscher  i mean we are trying to ascertain the truth here  arent we  that is absolutely correct young man  where did you attend law school  just sixth grade law your honor  but it was an accelerated program  it is up to my discretion to allow any testimony  that may speak to the truth of this case  proceed mr spencer with caution  thank you your honor  all right   just warming her up for you buddy  yeah go   hi priscilla  hi  everybody here is absolutely certain  you didnt sleep with jackson hale  but jackson hale  slept with  everybody  except for you  isnt that right  you couldnt take it could you  him walking by every single day and never noticing you  not once  repeatedly choosing  to sleep with women  like the defendant sandra panitch  well thats thats not thats not true  that video will show  jackson hale being murdered  but not by sandra panitch  by you  objection your honor i mean  this is its ridiculous  i feel the tape is the proof  the tape is the pudding  your honor i said objection  i demand you get him to stop that  sit down  do you need a tutorial in rule 775  mr riggs  can you please play the tape again  thank you  uh uh just take it back a little bit  and forward im sorry it was forward  and back  just forward  right there  right there  right here  that  that right there  its a cloud  not a cloud  a shadow  a shadow  of a human person  you were wearing those glasses that night  making it unmistakable  that you were there  that  is your shadow priscilla  you watched  you waited  waited for them to drop out of frame  then bam on the head to sandra and  into the heart of jackson  you didnt think there was any way  you could be blamed  because clouds dont kill people  people kill people  but this was a crime of passion  but not because he loved you  but because he didnt  he walked by me in the hallway  every day like i didnt exist  like i was invisible  and so you proved him right   by being invisible on that tape  we would have been the most amazing couple  he just refused to see it  he just broke my heart  over and over
