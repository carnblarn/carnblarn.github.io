just dont count the people who arent gonna get their lobster  and sand dabs as victims  im surprised the miami pd didnt fail you for lack of compassion  gus whats wrong with me  what is it that makes all the guys go crazy on me  jann was an idiot for giving you up  youre so sweet  sweet  sweet gus  yeah hes pretty sweet all right  his head is like a chocolatecovered honeydew  now would anyone like to talk about jan  its jann with a j  shawn is right we should do that so this is all that i have  i have some pictures of us together and a note that he wrote me  and a lipstick from him  do you have any more pictures  no  shawn  shouldnt you maybe go talk with miras parents   ill find you when were finished  i havent finished my   its fine ill finish it  you dont even know how to work with cork  mrs gaffney  hello   my name is shawn spencer  oh i know who you are  youre the psychic detective helping mira  you know ive always been fascinated by people with the gift  uh youre talking about this well that takes work  id like to ask you a question about jan  jann  i wouldnt know the first thing about him  i see  because you havent met him  very good  this is our private wine and alcohol collection  oh i see  i have a private room for all of my hello kitty shot glasses and wild animal scat  i have many interests  well only a privileged few are allowed down here  the wine in this room is worth over 1 million  weve been collecting it for years from all over the world  would you like a glass  actually i prefer my wine in a box  ive often heard thats the best way to savor wine  just skip over the taste buds and go right to the gullet  i swear if i have to deal with another tourist today my head is going to explode  and david doesnt like me drinking in front of the guests  so uh how did you manage to never meet jan  we tried to several times  take a sip before i finish the bottle  thats thats disgusting  thats a 30000 bottle of spanish sherry  its good  you know shawn i have very fine taste and i like my wine like i like my men  white and hairy  that doesnt make any sense  none what so ever  but i can see where mira gets her spunkiness  phyllis some of our guests are gonna whats going on here  i was just explaing our frustration over never meeting jann  yeah that guy  yeah every time we made plans he would change them at the last second  with that same lame excuse about having to work overseas  i cannot believe that i shut down my winery for this wedding  i should have known better  miras choices in men have always been suspect  including that guster  and his supposedly psychic friend  now if youll excuse us  yes of course  you have to finish packing your wine  youre moving into your winery in napa on friday  and your amazing collection will finally be on display for all to see   hey howd you know that  dont be intimidated sir  im just a man  oh god   brace yourself jan doesnt actually exist  what  fact there is no record of a jan anglund  buyer of fine wines and food on the internet anywhere  i did find a jeff anglund  hes an albino with a website dedicated toshort circuit   you put us on the email list  thats a given  nice  oh so she was lying  or she really is checking into the nutcracker suite  hear me mira made jan up  she made him up  what is  clozapine  its an antianxiety drug its also used to treat psychosis  bingo  mira had a prescription to clozapine but the refill date was from way back when   and she had a bunch of pills left  so she was off her meds  and off her rocker even more so than her mother  what  lets just say i know where mira gets her freaky side  i cant believe this  i was feeling bad for mira  i even started to  oh my gosh shawn she did all this to get me back i fell for it again  but wait theres more  the pictures  i sense something is very very very wrong about these photos very wrong indeed  jan anglund doesnt exist   thank you and good night  wait wait wait a minute  jan jann is real why would i make any of this up  to trick me into falling for you again  i cant believe youd go through all of this just to get me back  how sure are you about this theory  crystal  that doesnt really work very very sure  then how do you explain him   jann  mira honey im so sorry  im gonna grab a clark bar from the vending machine  uh anyone else want anything chief jules  gus youre good  okay honey i looked for you at the winery but they said you were here  where were you   you didnt get my message  what message  at the hotel desk  uh look i got a call to close this deal with these venture capitalists in portugal  it was for a very important client and i thought i could get back in time   venture capitalists really  im so sorry  i never should have gone i missed our big day  im just glad youre okay  why dont we talk about this back at the winery and spend some time getting to know you  yeah   just give me one second  all right  you both  i dont even know what to say to you  how could you be so cruel  doesnt exist huh thats great  hey should i put out an imaginary a pb for him on my invisible radio   i have a case to work  so do i  damn it shawn  you made me look like a fool in front of mira  dude you know deep deep down that there is something weird going on here  with mira  with jan suddenly appearing out of nowhere  im gonna prove it to you im gonna show you that somethings going on  no no more shawn stop it im serious about this  fine  for you ill stop  thank you  what are you doing here  well i was hoping to speak with jan for a minute   jann  i wont call him that  yeah hes off playing golf with my father  ah sweet   is that it cause im busy  actually there is one more thing  just between you and me whyd you fake those pictures of you and jan  i may have been wrong about a couple of things but i know for a fact that those pictures are fakes  jan had a shaving cut in the same place on his neck in each one of these pictures  even though they were taken at different times of the year  its gus fault really  ever since what happened between he and i my parents have been skeptical of every guy ive been with  andy amir guru anupam gay andy anthony  does gay andy know you call him that  he gave himself that name look jann and i had only been together for a few weeks  when we decided to get married and i know thats crazy but i just believe in all or nothing  you know doing what feels right are you following me shawn  what are you kidding me i spent an entire season with an interpretive dance group in buffalo  but see my parents were against this thing from the whole beginning  so jann photoshopped some pictures to make it look like we had been together   for longer than we had and it worked  wait a second  youre saying the pictures were jans idea  no jann  and yeah hes the one with the superfast printer  i gotta get that  uh thats coming from the room next door  mira mira mira  i said i was sorry about what happened with mira  i am trying to make it up to you here  come on man we havent played golf in forever this is gonna be fun  plus i promise to keep my caddy shack references to a minimum  now ive heard this club is restricted so uh dont tell em youre jewish   shawn  i didnt say i wouldnt make any  what are you doing the ladys tees up there  dude  you know what would be more fun  starting on the back nine  why cant we just start from here  i can par this hole with this putt  yes yes yes   great shot lets go  shawn  shawn get back here before i add two strokes to your score  whats the matter with you  is this the real reason you brought me golfing to follow jann  i told you to drop it hes back theres no more case  dude youre wrong jan is the case   hes the key  youre losing it  gus gus  thats the p i from the batting cages  even you have to admit this is getting weird  act natural  hey what are you guys doing here  whats up  just playing a little golf  keeping an eye out for suspicious meetings between shady people  what were you and mace rhoden arguing about  that was nothing  you know i was the guy who hired him i was late paying so he was kind of upset  maybe mira didnt tell you but im a psychic yeah  and right now the spirits are screaming something in my head over and over and over again  theyre saying so se prometer usar as penas   i dont understand  its portuguese for  only if you promise to keep your feathered headdress on  how can you possibly do business in portugal and not speak a word of the language   why did you really miss the wedding  okay   i wasnt in europe  yes  look the truth is i was in another relationship  i was in a bad situation i had to end it before i could get married to mira   you were cheating on mira  no all right  no not exactly okay it started before we even met  and i promise you its over now  i know that i havent always been a good guy  but being with mira you know its changed me  i realize now that shes the only thing in my life that matters  and you may not believe me but that is the truest thing i have ever said  look id better get back before miras dad despises me even more  shawn  ive been there before when it comes to mira   hes telling the truth  yeah but hes definitely lying   how can he be doing both  trust me  as someone who has occasionally dealt with halftruths jan brady is not telling us everything  hes my informant ill get the information we need  carlton this is my case  and besides your toughguy interrogation technique its not gonna work  oh and you think sweet and gentles gonna get info from a guy like this  please all i need is 30 seconds you could time me  fine ill play that game and i will beat you at it   fine  mcnab  were commandeering your watch  youre commandeering my watch  okay  now watch how i break this guy  its all in the eyes   all right you little son of a  time   what i just got started  theyre your rules  crap   hey  hi  you look hungry   kinda  thanks  so  what can you tell me about a refrigeration truck that was stolen a few days ago  refrigeration truck  oh come on  all i needs a name rusty  i know about pretty much every car boosted in santa barbara  but nothing as pointless as stealing a refrigerator truck  honest  time  all right cut the crap rusty we both know that you are holding out on me   i was eating that candy bar  well the candy police arent here today  its just me and i got at least 12 different charges i could pin on you  so you better start giving me some good information  i dont know  look theres only two reasons why anybody steals a car  to sell it or to use it  since nobodys come down to my shop to sell me your precious little truck  they need it for something  time   dont you dare tell her a thing  oh thats great detective work  probably why you scored a whole point lower than me on the exam  sorry to interrupt but the chief needs you for an important case   they took my clark bar  they took my watch   whats going on  its about miras fiance  i knew it the guys a crook  all right  playtimes over jan  ive had a bad psychic vibe about you from the beginning  why dont you go ahead and tell us what youve really been up to  whenever youre ready jan  jan  lets do a loop  i knew jann was bad news  wow gus you were so right why didnt i listen to you  we need to find out who killed him  thats a good idea  dude i have a theory  i dont think jan and mace were just arguing about money   what else were they arguing about  i dont know yet  but i want to talk to lassie and jules lets go  oh yeah um im not gonna be able to make it iam go by the winery  mira called she was wondering if i would come by   gus  ill be fine shawn  i just wanna be there for her as a friend   all right  cool  oh good youre all here  im having a psychic vision about jan and i have a theory about who may have killed him  lets just take a step back mr spencer  i just got the fingerprint results from the refrigerator truck case  do you wanna take turns with this  take turns whats going on here  ohara and i have a little competion excuse me  competition  it is not a competition  lassiter is just being a child about his detective exam score  wait the det i took that when i was 15  i got 100   im sorry you said you got a perfect score  yeah   and you were 15  yeah  why what did you guys get  you know its probably changed a lot since then you really cant compare it  apples and oranges  he cheated on me and then he lied to me about missing the wedding and now hes dead   i know exactly how you feel  really   well no  i always knew that  there was something wrong with jann from the very beginning there was a little voice inside me  that said it was all wrong but i didnt listen cause he had andys laugh  and gay andys sense of style and your heart  at least thats what i thought   what was that  i dont know but my parents are gone  and the vineyards closed  somebodys been in here  yeah i think maybe we should call the police  good idea  officer mcnab you were saying  uh yeah the lab matched one of the prints from the gold lighter that was dropped when  the truck was stolen to a known convict named marcus ridley a ka mike ray aka  my eyes its burning its stinging  stuff that old women carry in their purses   velamints  no its more of an aerosol   binaca  its not a breath freshener   mace  yes  mace rhoden thats right   was the truck yellow  well more like a mustard but yeah  oh im getting another vision two two two visions in one  its gus and the truck in the same place  gus is in danger  we have to save gus  come on  all right i left mr and mrs gaffney a message but gus isnt picking up at all   someone give me a gun  no   what exactly is going on  okay okay  remember when i said that jan anglund didnt existwell technically i was right  you know what forget that i was totally right  hes not jan anglund hes a con man working with mace rhoden  the guy who stole your mustard refrigerator truck  keep talking  well a few months ago they started a long con on mira gaffney  the plan was for jan to romance mira and marry her on the beach in santa barbara  but miras parents asked too many questions  so jan doctored the photos to convince them to have the wedding  see my parents were against this thing from the beginning so jann photoshopped some  pictures to make it look like weve been together for longer than we had and it worked  the wedding was merely a cover so that miras father would shut down the winery for a day  jan intended to leave mira at the altar while mace broke into david  gaffneys cellar to steal his priceless wine collection and skip town  but there was no robbery at the winery and jan didnt skip town he came back   he had a change of heart  oh dont  theres something about mira jan was telling the truth and lying at the same time  the truth is i was in another relationship i was in a bad situation  i had to end it before i could marry mira  his other relationship was with his partner mace  he ended it because he actually fell in love with mira and couldnt go through with the plan  thats why they argued at the golf course and thats why mace killed him   but why is guster in trouble  because its thursday night lassie  the gaffneys are moving their most expensive bottles of wine to napa tomorrow  meaning that mace is stealing them right now somebody give me a gun   no  then drive faster  then drive faster thats my best friend in there   good  you got my message  yeah we looked we cant find em anywhere  the wine cellar gus  gus  dont shoot everythings okay   mira  mom  what is going on here what have you gotten her into  gus dont speak  i can tell you precisely what happened here sir  gus and mira discovered uh mace rhoden robbing the cellar  he pulled a gun  he tied them up  and gus assessed the situation and devised the following brilliant plan  he finessed them loose he told mira to perform her dragonheaded bar trick  that made him fall for her in the first place triggering the sprinklers  they wrestled over the gun  mira fainted  and we walked in just as gus d tdd the bad guy  well done guster well done   thank you sir  very impressive  yeah very quick thinking  i was just doing what anyone would have done  honey lets get you out of here   but i dont remem  darling come here  come on sweetie  lets go  yeah its time to go  god hes all wet   dude thats not how it happened  i know  maces cigarette triggered the sprinklers and he slipped and fell  and then i may have knocked mira over as i ran away  lets keep that last part to ourselves you bet  you guys its been such a crazy week  but thanks to you both im gonna get through it  so thank you  oh oh shawn gus and me are gonna go rock climbing in rattlesnake canyon  and then im gonna teach him how to hang glide off cathedral peak  and its gonna be so amazing do you wanna come  you know what mira  we just got a call from a prospective client something about a ghost in a ballroom  we should probably go work on that is that okay mira  oh of course i totally understand you guys do amazing work  but i just wanna see you both before i leave  miras moving to greenland to save polar bears  of course you are   do you wanna
