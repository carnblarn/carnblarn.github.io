now the weddings tomorrow   is he coming  not yet  but were getting closer  thanks stabber  mandatory briefing magnolia room 15 minutes  excuse us please attorney general maxwell  detective i trust were making progress  i am right on schedule sir  ive booked myself a suite to use as a command center  why  ill stay the night if i have to keep an eye on things  the citys not paying for that is it  uh no  that ring has been in my family for 200 years  my mother agonized over the decision to give it to my son  im not letting it get away now  sir we are checking every person who came  through that door every employee every guest  nobody checks out of this hotel until were just short  of going through every piece of their luggage   way ahead of you sir  no youre not  what  can i help you sir  im just  listening   for what  for what   lyme disease  lyme disease  lyme disease rickets avitaminosis legionnaires bubonic you name it  i want you to listen to something  do you hear that   we have spores in the wall  spores  know where else they are in the planter  you know where else everywhere in the entire hotel  who called you mike  mike is this a big joke to you  i dont answer to mike  have you seen mike lately mike can kiss my ass  i was called in by the state inspector himself  are you at all aware how dangerous this is   hell yes i am  good im glad  i need access to this whole place elevator shafts air vents   the safe room obviously  the safe room is a crime scene  this eucalyptus will be dead by lunch  the safe room will be a triage unit  if i dont get those spores out of there  understood  can we let the cops finish up in there first  you tell them to hurry  oh man   the wedding party entered the safe room  placing the ring into a safety deposit box  which was slid into the safe and closed for the night  no sensors indicate that either the safe door  or the lock box was opened again until the following morning  please note  he has activated the timelock which prevents the safe from opening  no one walks into that room again until the following morning  when the ring is discovered missing  so it definitely didnt disappear during the night  or so they would like you to think  however if you look closely there are nine glitches on this tape   im sorry glitches  seams  static bursts in the image  someone could have tapped in an alternate  video feed of this room while it was empty  or more likely as i believe  someone built a scale replica of this room  who laughed  nobody  if someone disagrees with my theory id like to know  it does seem very elaborate  and just a bit farfetched  are you a detective why are you here  you asked for all of us to come  well officer  since youre such an expert on fetching  why dont you fetch me a cup of coffee  moving on  all the employee alibis check out except this one  dietrich mannheim currently the facilities manager  you may remember him from the security video  he was in the room when the ring  was placed into the safety deposit box  during questioning he was nervous evasive  and contradicted himself more than once  his work computer history reveals that he recently  visited websites for boats and expensive cars  and he failed to show up for work  questions  is this your only lead  his responses to my interrogation were hostile at best  clarify hostile   use my tone now as a guide  detective ohara all alone  well not anymore apparently  work troubles  yeah im sensing work troubles  here let me read your palm   how about just one finger  come now   let me see if i can be helpful  why are you here  the maxwell wedding  honestly i was invited  by whom  beth bethany the bride  little baby b  the b sting love her god dylan is so lucky to have her  she grounds him in ways that he needed grounding  dont you think  shes a good sport  air supply really kidding  just kidding relax  this is work related  you thought this place would be different  but  nobody respects your opinions  they all think youre too young   always  always  you know  i think you and i could help each other   and how would that be  well i know things  things about rings  oh i thought you were here for a wedding  i am  ish  you first  i just got a message for you mr guster  and um  well im afraid its about your cat  my cat   the poor thing is in the animal hospital  they think her leg is broken  ill ill get down there later   youre not going  im very busy  but your cat needs you for moral support  the vet said it could be the difference  later  you have to go   mr guster i know that youre in shock  dont do anything youre going to regret forever   i dont even  hes not going  so now i have a cat  an orange tabby last christmas  you made her a tiny santa hat it was adorable  fantastic  i cant even have a makebelieve boy cat  gus a boy cat wouldnt serve my purposes  nearly as well  the next time i need you pickles is having kittens   pickles  mrs pickles is her full name  though im not actually sure cats can marry  outside of boston  yeah well in a related issue im blocking your  number on all the phones in the office  if you think thatll work i think its endearing  in the meantime arent you the least bit curious  about who was there when they put the ring in the hotel safe  wait a minute   this is a safecracking case  did i forget to mention that  what kind of safe  the uh hydra 700  the 700 is out  thats impossible nobody could have cracked that  i havent even told you about the wall sensors  can we be done by 300  yes  the safe room  right behind that door  what is all this i thought this was a safe job  oh uh lassiter has this insane idea that this is an elaborate heist  like on par with oceans eleven or thomas crown or uh  the one where they kill donald sutherland  in the first 10 minutes remake uh  mr spencer mr guster what a surprise  chief lookin good  youre probably wondering  i sent an officer down to the high school  to take a look at your secretary suspect  she cracked  he didnt even get the first question out  really but  because i envisioned that being harder  yet i dont recall asking you to come down here to the de la cruz  well we have reason to believe this case goes  in a completely different direction  let me be perfectly clear  i didnt see you and we didnt talk  call me if you have something   i love her  yeah  he knows you  i had to lay some groundwork  he doesnt believe in psychics this is plan b  chief inspector shawn how are you  im undercover  not even the american police know im in on this  im sorry i i blew it again  a and after you brought me into your confidence  bobby its fine believe me  these other interpol guys are very  appreciative of what youre doing here  how long will you need  just as we discussed five minutes tops  youre my man  interpol  thats right missing ring division  i was recruited out of north africa when i was 15   you could have at least used a british accent  oh please gus  i started with a british accent and then  seamlessly slipped into my fake american one  bobby gave me some pointers  apparently you americans say howdy a lot  howdy  what are you doing  uh a list i made a list of suspects after attending lassiters briefing  he let you in his briefing   he does when youre in the air shaft  all your suspects are in the wedding party  the only ones who knew they put that  ring in the safe were at the rehearsal dinner   so it was an inside job  looking like it  youre making keys   gus how else do you expect me to get in the rooms   shawn you cant do that  of course i can  i worked at the hampton inn for that  threeday weekend in austin when we were 19  i know you remember that gus this is so easy  try making a key  dude i rule  nope innocent lets move  what are you talking about  we havent even stepped foot in there  gus do you need the remedial course really  uncle leo left his wallet on the table  criminals are sneaky jaded suspicious people  theyre smart and defensive this guy has a reason to be trusting  can we go now  shawn  guys hey   uh your door was open  oh it was  yes and i was worried that something horrible had happened  youre youre okay  yeah yeah  i told you we didnt have to come in here  theyre fine everybodys fine  this is my associate gus  you can just call him peter panic   how you doing  so youre a psychic too  well gus here is a safe expert  yes he subscribes to the safecracker  uh safecracking comic book  its an online magazine  and its a trade publication  excuse me for saying so  but how exactly do you figure into this legal family  i started my criminal law degree  then i came to my senses went to europe painted slept ate  sank a boat   disappointed  besotted  wed like to speak to the best man if possible  so would we any ideas where he is  we havent seen him since the night of the 6th  thats the night the ring disappeared  the florist quit so after we dropped the ring off at the safe  we had to wrap bouquets all night in our suite  everybody except jack   do you think hes a suspect  no no  we just think hes lazy  hey dad this is shawn spencer  hes the psychic i told you about  i know lets talk  son im very comfortable with the current  direction of the investigation  so lets let the real police department do their job  sir believe me i am only here to help  in fact i was actually hoping to discuss  im glad you understand  guy shook my hand like i stole something  see thats why i cant do this job alone  that is about as orange as you can get   which suspects room is this  lassiters  the head detective he has his own room   perhaps paid for by the city  no no  this has gone too far were not staying  gus we need these witness statements  its not exactly like were being overwhelmed with cooperation here  oh lacey  lacey you can sink my boat  toss me the remote  its the bottom of the eighth inning and so far  what do you got you got anything good  i hate to say it but yeah  the attorney general has an insurance policy on the ring  hell collect a cool three million  dollars as long as it still belongs to him  which it does only until these two are married  well well well  i im supposed to knock forgive me detective  detective  head detective sorry  i was told you wouldnt be here until 600 tonight  thats right 600 tonight  head detective i changed my plan please dont tell anyone  absolutely sir  thanks   is there anything i can do for you while im here  as a matter of fact yes there is  wed like a room service menu delivered immediately  in lassiters photo  there didnt appear to be a mark on that safe  i dont care how good you are  you dont crack a hydra without leaving some sort of visible residue  we need to see that safe  thats going to be a little difficult  how close do you need to be  is there a secret back door through the kitchen  no were going to take the air vents  unfortunately both my access points  are blocked by santa barbaras finest  you think im going in there   you know you want to  not in this suit  do you want to see the safe or not thisll be easy  we take this dumbwaiter up to the grate  pop the screen crawl right through the shafts  three rights and a left  we check our progress through the vents  isnt it kind of weird how the bodys just shoved in here  no whats weird is theres a dead guy in a dumbwaiter  and were standing here staring at it waiting for somebody to find us   lets go  this is lassiters suspect  shawn close the hatch and keep your voice down  i dont want to explain how we got in here  i just need to see one thing  just  you answered it   uh hello  three days shawn  dad hey going to have to call you back  no no you were supposed to call me yesterday  you were supposed to call me the day before  we need to

an answer  tonight uh no tomorrow  tomorrow wonderful  otherwise i am putting it outside and thats where its sitting   now how hard was that  so easy anything else  no unless of course you need something  no im good  actually wait i do have one question  go ahead  how long does it take before a dead body starts to smell bad  god  did you wipe our fingerprints off   of course i did we were never there  we need to call the chief soon  if dietrich was a part of this hes not anymore  why is it the attorney general has to call me  wondering why some civilian is wandering around  grilling his entire family  wait a second the attorney general has your number  what are you guys tight give it up whats the story  he also told me to keep you out of here  by any means necessary  which opens up an entire world of exciting  possibilities for me personally  gus  gus  oh its too much  its too much too much  youre not going to shoot him are you  i havent decided  oh my ear gus my ear  oh for the love of mike you are not going to escape  so will you just give it up  check the dumbwaiter open the dumbwaiter  detective ohara  oh my lester lester lester  les get over here  lets go get him in the van  come on you two out  dont we get to wait around for the autopsy  well call you if we need you   detective  sir  shut this down keep it quiet  nobody in the wedding party is to know about this  theyve been through enough  yes sir  well that ought to keep them busy for a while  can we at least watch the tape in another room besides lassiters   gus hes not coming back  are you sure about that  yes didnt you check his messages   are you going to have some cookies  no   you want to finish my banana  i want to leave  look at the best man hes smashed  and look at his hair its horrible  thats

dude says uhoh  i thought you said you wanted it inside the pinata   eat eat like men  youre really mad  we have less than 12 hours to solve the case  and youre throwing a kegger in a police officers room  why would i be mad  gus his best man was a total washout he wasnt going to plan anything  we have to dig information out of suspects  and youre wasting time  dylan  dude you wow  yes wow  gus here has some questions for you you flaxenhaired argonaut  anything for you two i love you guys  ive found that theyre particularly forthcoming  with information while in this state  for example ive eliminated every suspect here  although  there is a guy stealing cable and another  refilling his minibar bottles with shampoo  but i dont think these are gateway crimes to a jewelry heist  seriously gussy  come on give me a kiss  no no nothing weird on my cheek   get me out of here  i think its your turn to dig  do you know who stole the ring  no  and to be honest i dont care  i didnt even want the damn thing  okay the night that we announced our engagement  no my dad stops dinner right in the middle of my speech  so  he goes and gets my grandmothers ring  what am i supposed to say  no so now its not about us its about him again  i mean forget the fact that i just chose the person  that i want to spend the rest of my life with  i dont want to seem ungrateful but if it were up to me  id just as soon we stop looking  cross him off  dylan how is dad  i mean financially would you say everything is  okay  so much for that  dylan was the only shot we had in this room  but thats okay  we have other suspects in this hotel  at least take a traveler  sweet nectar  yeah all right  its crazy running into you guys here what are the odds   you got anything  these girls are not criminals  well it was worth a shot  you want to get out of here  yes i do   so how you holding up  im good  my dad brought in all this extra security for some reason   can he afford that  what do you mean  i dont know its just  it was a tough year financially for a lot of people  what are you getting at  im just making random conversation  theres my bouquet  thats fantastic  well its subpar i was rushed all that craziness  i wish i could fix it  well lets just lets just take it out  its locked  they lock up flowers  i bet you could open it you have good hands  shawn  excuse me  you left me in there  yes i did and youre very welcome  i just got a lap dance from patrick swayze  what do you mean like an impersonator  no i think it was actually patrick swayze  im going home were done  all weve done is eliminate suspects were back where we started  gus were fine  weve got the wedding ceremony tomorrow to solve the case  oh oh okay  so we can do what an entire police force cant in two hours  okay youre right  we should totally get there half an hour early  ah you are the most beautiful bride in this room  thank you  does anyone need help  the bouquets still arent here  we might as well not even have the ceremony  okay you relax breathe  think happy thoughts  puffy clouds mac and cheese lou diamond phillips  look it worked   what are you doing  helping  no those bouquets are very specific  they look identical maam  its my wedding shouldnt i be the one freaking out  plenty of time for that later  where is it  wheres my bouquet  shes really a very nice person under normal circumstances  lace everything okay up here you all right  yeah sorry  i think im having sympathy bridezilla   im good now  great  emma doesnt want to wear the flower in her hair  but these are magic flowers  do you want one now  i dont know what to tell you sir but these are the charges  1600 for a junior suite   with a queen bed  well the room was a small portion  however its all your room charges that drove up your bill  i was hardly even in the room  im sorry detective lassiter but thats what it says here  this isnt detective lassiter  i beg your pardon  well hes a shorter guy brown hair suede jacket  helped him fill the jacuzzi with champagne last night  really  if i brought this man here could you identify him  oh absolutely in fact i can tell you where he is  hes over at the maxwell wedding  the chapel is just outside the east lawn  ill be right back  i dylan take you bethany   i dylan take you bethany   to be my wife   to be my wife  confident on my heart   confident on my heart  that you will be a faithful friend   that you will be a faithful friend  and a true and loving companion   and a true and loving companion  excuse me  i think we should wait until the ceremonys over  fine  nice suit  whered you get that from  gus dont underestimate me or my wardrobe  then you might want to remove   dont pull that off dont dont dont  ill just slide it  theyre here for you  not if i solve this case first  good plan youve got about five minutes  i already know who did it  no you dont who is that possible  between all that  when you said your girlfriend just had an aneurysm  because she got the wrong bouquet  you had the time to put all that out of your mind and solve the case   gus  what  and now for a moment of silence  gus i seriously do have a guess   probability of being right  i dont know  high 60s  close your mouth  but the persons in the room  the thief could escape shouldnt i stop the wedding  no under no circumstances are you allowed to stop this wedding  if theres any reason why these two should not be wed  speak now or forever hold your peace  i have something  its not necessarily marriagerelated  i hope thats not a problem  sir please  i know who stole the ring  you cannot do this shawn  this wedding has taken over a year to plan   what are you doing  radioing the chief  i can see it i can feel it  i can now feel the ring  its in this room its in the room  its in this room  they wouldnt bring the stolen ring to the ceremony you moron  they would if they couldnt get to it till today  lacey im so sorry  and believe me when i say  i really really really wish it wasnt you  me  are you crazy  im the one whos done all the work  yes you are and were all very impressed  but it was also an excellent cover wasnt it  you are crazy shawn  and by the way were officially off for next friday  oh boy i can see it now  youre at the dinner table theyre announcing the engagement  youre thrilled of course  you and bethany have been best friends forever  dad  dad has a surprise for the happy couple  what could it be  wait a minute  you didnt know the ring was going to dylan  you were always your grandmothers favorite  and youre the oldest girl that ring should be yours right  right  you were counting on that ring  it was your future  sorry  i can see you plotting  i can see you plotting right there at the dinner table  but dad  dad throws a curveball  no it was a slider  hes overly cautious because sometimes engagements end  not you guys  its okay  theyre not letting go of the ring until the wedding  which means you have a very small window within which to grab it  does all of this have anything to do with  why these two shouldnt be married  no sir no it doesnt at all actually  oh boy oh boy oh boy  of course  you insisted it be used during the rehearsal  so then you had your chance  while everyone else was fawning over the ring  you made one final adjustment  it looked like you just straightened it out and put it right back  but you never did did you  no lacey because you  have magic hands  which i was really looking forward to on friday  everyone was fooled  everyone was fooled except  dietrich mannheim  who hadnt yet discovered how to use this information to his benefit  this is firstrate fiction shawn  unfortunately theres no evidence  there would have been no evidence  if you could have gotten away that night  but there was a problem  yes  you were called away  the florist  the florist bailed on you the bouquets  you got a lastminute batch of materials  and the bouquets would now have to be crafted by hand  there was no other time but now  you looked for a way out but there was none  you had a  fivemilliondollar ring that was about  to be discovered missing any minute hidden in your palm  and you were going to have to pull an  allnighter in a room with eight other people  you thought you could get back into the cooler later and grab it  but they kept their flowers locked up  so you had to have your specific bouquet or else  lacey youre not an unreasonable person  youre just a thief  or at least you were a thief  until dietrich mannheim called told you that he was on to you  he wanted a piece of that action too or he was going to the police  you tried to talk him down but he got rough  he got ugly  it was all spinning out of control  eventually they were going to find that body  so you started laying out clues  you sent the police off in all directions  because youd grown up hearing all about crime scenes  i would say thats fortuitous  because you knew just what to leave didnt you  i have worked 18 hours a day on this wedding  i have sacrificed my weekends  i will not be treated this way  then show us your bouquet lacey  shes running in those heels really  we have to chase her too  but we have no evidence except for that ring  dude youre next  come on youre still angry  even after i solved your crime  is this the man  no  this guy was not in my room  ive never seen him before  you got a room  why  we should have a party  get out of my sight  thank you bobby  interpol appreciates both of your efforts  i love weddings dont you  i didnt exactly think it was appropriate  for you to give the toast  well the best man was unprepared someone had to step in  besides it was like a practice run for your wedding  you are not going to be my best man  you bet your ass i am  ive already picked out which song im singing at the altar  really  you still like ted nugent  remind me to show you your vows  theyre going to make you cry  gus
