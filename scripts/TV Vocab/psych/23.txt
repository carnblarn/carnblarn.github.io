                so then this um guy  with pliers comes in probably with safety goggles  maybe some sort of fire retardant cover all  he starts doing his thing twisting and turning  theres all sorts of fluids just spraying all over the place  then this hydraulic lift comes into play  wheeling everything out of there there you have it   all right lets clean up  wait  thats how babies are born   yes  with a hydraulic lift   more or less  but how are they made  uh shawn more important question how many hats are in the room  none how are they made  hats nowadays i hear most of them are made in china   lets go  forget it   maybe ill go ask mom  d dont no no  wait wait come back here come back here come back here all right  tuck in your shirt before you talk to her  all right tell me exactly what she said   use her words  she said hello  this is chief vick its a good start gus  i love it when she says that  i have something big to talk to you about its top secret  come down to the station as soon as you can  do you realize what this means  it means were taking it to the next level  she said big and top secret thats two of our favorite 80s movies  i read about the international yacht bandit  i bet you were going undercover on a yacht  gus lets not get ahead of ourselves  she may want us to catch that guy whos been stalking lingerie models  i know what it is last night on the news i saw something about a blimp   blimp rides   shotgun  you cant call shotgun on a blimp  you can call shotgun anywhere except a crowded movie theater  all right close the blinds shut the door and remain completely silent  this is big  look im trusting you both to be professional  and to keep this matter completely confidential   you got it  if you knew how many secrets  i was keeping from you already youd totally trust me   it involves a nanny  nanny serial killer   nanny on the run  nanny arsonist  does she fly a blimp by chance  no i need you to hire me a nanny  psych 208 robabye baby  o i know you know o o that im not telling the truth o  o i know you know o o they just dont have any proof o  o embrace the deception o  o learn how to bend o o your worst inhibitions o  o tend to psych you out in the end o   our big case is finding you a nanny for your baby  well id be hiring you privately of course  but i cannot stress how important this is  of course our children are our most precious resources  yes  that also i havent slept in weeks  see my nephew was nannying her and then he went back to nursing school  and ever since he left she wont fall asleep  which means that i dont fall asleep are you up for this job  i  yeah yeah i guess  see i can run the background checks on the nannies  of course not to mention the drug testing the psychological briefings  but i want to hire you both to psychically read the best candidate  look chief with all due respect i think our services might be better utilized  your services are best utilized by doing exactly what i say  you are not my first choice mr spencer  and i cannot stress how important this is  i need sleep  all right so uh while were looking for this babysitter  nanny  how about we also hop on board the yacht bandit case   because i think  oh no  no no no no no way  if im hiring you privately then this is the only case  that youre going to be working on  i mean when youre working on police cases  its not like you take private cases as well  or do you   no  no   of course not  we dont do that   that would be unprofessional  it would break the psychicclient   we wouldnt even think of it  code  great you can go ahead and leave the door open  well harry you and deeshaw start a timeline  mcnab i want you to help schwartz go over the witness statements  dobson i want you on tactical   where the hell is dobson  look gus a real case  what do you have  something something lassiters case dude this blows with a capital z  shawn this is the only case were supposed to be working on  besides its really important  nannies are essential parts of todays working nuclear families  theyre babysitters who drive  might i remind you that this is a private case  for the chief of police to find a caretaker for her child  if we screw this up well be on her bad side for pretty much ever  gus youre not going to find a nanny on the internet  if theyre posting there theyre already too desperate  its like online dating  remember when you went on matchmakercom  you mean when you posted a profile of me without my knowledge  right and all the women who responded were complete freaks  thats because you said i was looking for a woman  who was strong enough to hold me  i didnt think they would take it literally  look dude all the good nannies are employed we gotta do some field work  we gotta find the right nanny and steal her for chief vick  we should go to a playground in a really good neighborhood  thats actually a good idea  plus this way we can race on the monkey bars  you know gus we may be working the lowest stakes case  of our short careers but theres something nice  about just sitting and enjoying a sunny day at the park  shawn concentrate  look over there the one in the over alls  she seems to be using reverse psychology  on that tenyearold which is actually a pretty good idea   you know whats nota good idea  what  pineapple and movie theater popcorn flavored jelly beans   thats disgusting  shawn stop spitting  youre scaring the children  hi would you like some candy  i cant say that i blame her these are disgusting  i mean these are really horrible   why cant i stop eating them  thats it were splitting up  youre freaking out the kids   and me  fine  thank you for that im serious  i mean i thought this was supposed to be a safe neighborhood  just because youre rich doesnt mean youre safe  marissa get off of her now  so you know annie she worked for the bermans  she had to go to the police station because they thought  she might be a material witness  cause of when the house by them got robbed  so dakota let someone else go on the slide  they spoil that little girl so hard  so then an  perry luke  ill be sitting right here  remember stranger danger  stranger danger the parents make me say that  hi im shawn im uh im a manny around here  oh im ada this is jaynie   are you with an agency  no i dont model  strictly a manny  um no most of the families in this neighborhood   get their nannies from our agency  oh which one is that  red balloon  you should talk to them about getting reassigned  adas freaking out because she doesnt feel safe   working in the heights anymore  why not oh gosh  is there a lot of crime around here what kind   just some burglaries  just  all these houses   only three  three that weve heard about  they all happen in like the middle of the day  and all of them had security systems and everything and it didnt matter  yeah but its not like its your stuff theyre stealing  so what do you care i dont like to be around it  cody wyoming get your foot out of that dog   hi  hi  which one is yours  oh uh im the nanny for those two  oh really  do they always fight like that  pretty much   which ones yours  oh no kids just me  so what are your thoughts on discipline  do you spank   here you go  thank you  youre welcome  is that your nanny right there  no she is  so she doesnt always pay attention to where you are huh  it would be pretty easy for you to get away and she wouldnt even know  kids i just want to eat em up  none of these nannies will talk to me even the kids are avoiding me  tell me the truth do i smell weird  nah its just the usual jerk chicken and new car smell  look i was talking to those two nannies right  oh yeah you think they may be right for chief vick  nah theyre terrible yelling at the kids gossiping  all they paid attention to is themselves  but heres the good news this neighborhood is rife with crime  see what i mean  shawn i think youre forgetting why were here  did you really just do that  what  hey guys  buzz  listen i got a call about two creepy dudes hanging out in the playground  really i havent seen anything  but ill keep my eyes open  yeah weve just been here hanging out in the bushes  oh boy  sorry about this  im so sorry   hey no hard feelings right  of course not  i mean if you have to have a jackie earle haley moment  youd you want it to be from bad news bears   maybe breaking away  not little children  listen id be happy to give you guys a ride to wherever you need to go  attention all officers  we have a call on a 459 breakin at 3192 roscoe  there we need to go there   you need to go to a crime scene  yeah its crazy  the chief asked us to look into any new burglaries  in the neighborhood while we were here   at the park  okay fine hop in  no why you always get to sit in the front  i called shotgun   no you didnt  shotgun  chief vick better not catch us here shawn  would you relax shes not gonna show up at some random burglary scene  we spent all afternoon on that nanny thing  this is like a coffee break  the coolest coffee break ever   this is so wrong shawn  that must be why it feels so good   we already have a case  gus we can do both  its called multitasking  okay looks like somebody came home  kicked off their shoes made some chamomile tea  what ever happened to throwing back a few beers after work  whatever happened to cleaning  this is disgusting  whoever broke in managed to disarm security find the safe and open it  and killed a guy  so this is where mr teatime got steeped  that doesnt even make sense  got brewed got tea bagged  that must be what killed him   good eye gus  thank you  so mr teatime wasnt feeling well  he comes home early surprises the intruder  the murder didnt have a weapon reaches for the first thing he can find  didnt mean to hurt anybody hes just a normal thief right  dude i bet this is connected to those robberies  the nannies were talking about  chief vick  man we gotta get out of here  i think walking like this makes everything more exciting  i do not think this is a good idea  she was clear about only wanting us to find her a nanny  are you kidding me  ill have a psychic vision about the whole string of robberies   she will love it  i havent finished the report yet   is your other arm in a sling  excuse me  i dont want excuses carlton i just want the report   im not giving excuses  then why are you still talking  head detective my ass   uh listen i can finish the report  i can do my own job ohara   i know you  i can do my own job ohara  who finished the coffee didnt make a fresh pot  i mean who does that  what kind of person acts like that  ooh shawn gus hi good to see you  come on in come on in   so you found me a nanny  actually we were working on that when  i had a vision  it was a robbery turned to murder theres a light  oh do you know who the murder is  unless you can name me the murder in ten seconds then im not interested  ten nine one  i hired you to find me a nanny and thats it  yes thats it  absolutely but chief i have this feeling  mr spencer i thought you understood that when i hired you this was to be  your top priority your only priority  it is this is it  in fact we even narrowed it down to the final three candidates  go find three candidates  this has to be connected to the other burglaries in the heights  dont even think about it  no you go ahead im just going to say a quick hello  hold on a second i might need to make that a large  can i help you  you guys want to go in with me on a meatlovers cheesy crust  no time for a pizza party spencer  nothing helps a big case more than a belly full of pepperoni   were busy  okay  keep it a medium but yes to the crazy bread  it makes sense that all these burglaries  were connected cause they all have the same mos  daytime burglaries  hidden valuables found and stolen disabled alarm systems  yes thats what i was in the middle of saying   well then say it  uh hold on a second   uh jalapeyo poppers cinnamon wings  walk away  thank you very much for your time  now if you all can just wait here for one sec  shawn im glad youre here  scuse me  im feeling really good about these nannies  jean has a background in montessori and sue has some interesting ideas  about establishing nap time routines that i kind of like  all right  no no good none of them  what why  slob psycho slut  i spent hours interviewing them calling references  and you just come in here and dismiss them in two seconds  well take a look gus the one on the far left is a slob  shes smelling her own armpit  psycho there has been scribbling in her diary   from the moment i walked in  so maybe shes just creative  its the same sentence over and over again  now i dont know what that sentence is  but there is no configuration of words that makes that behavior acceptable  fine that still leaves fiona  why is she a slut  that was more me predicting her future   aw man  what  all right everybody out  sorry ladies the position has been filled  dont drive angry   why did you do that  gus she was getting married  so she can still work for chief vick  no shes consumed with planning her wedding  she was studying that bridal magazine like it was a textbook  after shes done with that shell be on the fertility fast track  then shell have her own baby  and chief vick will be out another nanny  and i do not want to have to do all this work again  and what work exactly are you doing  how about progress on our actual case  looks like all these robberies are inside jobs  the key is finding the connection between the victims  but we dont know anything about the other houses that were robbed  all im saying is  im just trying to say dont make me slap you shawn  check it out i got some snapshots of the evidence  well at least two of the victims have something in common   what  startek security company  and you dont find it strange that all four of these homes had startek security  yet none of them were secure  actually people get overconfident with a security system and neglect  taking even the most basic precautions  like turning the system on for example  so youre saying all of these homeowners just forgot to turn on their alarms  thats one theory   thats a pretty flimsy theory  yeah i dont think thats what happened  what im going to need from you spock is a list  i just told you yes i am second in command  but my name is gary mills  im at a loss  youll have to talk to bones and get back to me  jules lassie  why are you here  well i was just in the neighborhood and my ears started tingling  and then they got pointier oh and my hand  my hand started doing this all on its own   like in that show  star trek  and this is startek  hilarious whats your point  excuse me for trying to take you on a wonderful psychic journey okay  i think theres a connection between this place  and the string of robberies in the heights  howd you know about the robberies  i uh felt a burning when i sat down  forget i asked  please excuse my pseudocolleagues presence now assuming  that all four of our homeowners  didnt just forget to turn on their systems  i think a startek employee couldve gotten those access codes to break in  you remind me of one of my professors  did you ever teach at devry school of technology   no  well i had one of these professors  who often had harebrain theories like yours  if we were really gonna rob any of the houses  that we monitor we would choose one in a totally higher income bracket  take a look at this mansion huh  i would rob this bad boy so fast your head would spin  really how   lassiter i dont  ohara please  what do you want shawn  gus theres no way it can be these security guys  i mean they want to be cops but theyre really just on domestic detail  really like youre a wannabe detective following a case were not even on  when you should be finding chief vick a new nanny  i trust you to head that up gus  meanwhile im going to borrow your car check out those other houses that were robbed  no way  i will not have my echo be a part of your flagrant disobeying of the chief  use your motorcycle  dude i cant do recon with that on suburban streets  help me find the nanny and then ill take you  gus im a grown man  i dont have to depend on others to drive me around   okay  fine  ooh slow down slow down  what are we looking for again  my kinkajou hes got to be around here somewhere  maybe hes more in the middle of the block   your kinkawhat  kinkajou  its a 12inch monkeylike mammal  its become quite vogue to keep as a pet  dermot mulroney had one named baby love  but i named mine red hot monkey love  all right shawn cut the crap  im only doing this cause you agreed to mow the lawn  its time to fess up what is really going on here  all right fine theres been a string of robberies in the heights  and i need to get a closer look at one of the houses that got robbed  why didnt you just say so  because its more fun to say kinkajou  all right which one  that one  yeah well thats a stupid house to rob  does anyone live up to your standards  maybe we can get a hold of the burglars number  you can call tell him how disappointed you are  shawn take a look at all the houses on this block  of all of em tell me why that one would be your last choice to break into   i dont know dad i  shawn now  because all the other houses are easier targets  than the one that actually got robbed  neighbor two houses down has been gone for several days  didnt bother to suspend their newspaper delivery   good what else  the house on the other side  is completely hidden by those trees and bushes  its the perfect vantage point for a burglar  especially during the day time  not to mention our house has a security system  and bars on the windows  this was not a crime of chance shawn  that house was chosen for a reason   there can only be one  what  i thought we were doing lines from highlander  my bad   lets get out of here  wait that sensational feeling  that is the quickening  everyone can do connery your lambert sucks   at least i have a lambert  hey ada its jaynie  they let me out early want to meet up tonight  a nanny wouldnt be able to afford coach sunglasses am i right  well she should be able to nannies are criminally underpaid  right because our children are our most precious resources  because children are maddening hellions  a great nanny can make all the difference in the world havent you seen nanny 911  no im still trying to catch up on my dog whisperers  nannies on there are brilliant  i wish i had one of em when you were a kid  uh dont beat yourself up pop  sure most of my good traits come from mom  but you uh  no thats really all i got  okay chief let me begin by saying no  we have not found you a nanny yet  but i have had a vision about nannies ironically  rings of nannies  uh rings of of around my collar  of thieves rings of thieves  supplementing their paltry incomes as nannies  rogue nannies robbing their bosses aykroyds and belushis  neighbors robbing their bosses neighbors  chief if i can just get a little closer to these robberies  and and and we would still find you a nanny eventually  oh mr spencer im sorry  i mustve fallen asleep  that is so creepy your eyes were wide open  yeah i learned to do that back when i was on stakeouts  i have never been so sleepdeprived in my life  but thank goodness you found me a nanny  n no  no we havent we havent done that yet   then why are you here  thats what i was saying  ive got some very strong psychic rumblings  about those robberies  i gave you explicit instructions and youre here to tell me  that youve completely disregarded everything i said  no no no not completely  well look if youre gonna put it like that then sort of  well  let me put it just like this  and listen very closely  because i want you to get it clearly  this time  you are  fired  yeah  ah from which case  all of them  trying to solve that case is what got us in trouble in the first place shawn  she said she wanted me to name the murder  as long as i could do it in ten seconds  and as long as it didnt distract from the nanny search  so you find the perfect nanny before she does  ill find the murder for the police and voila shes loving us again  and exactly how is this plan different from what we were doing before  because now were renegades dude  its so hardcore  working without the chiefs knowledge  racing against a ticking clock for her approval  its gonna be so much more exciting   cant you feel it  no shawn  i dont feel it i feel depression  i feel a series of missed payments on our rent  thats the only thing that motivates me to think we need to fix this  i need to get more information on those two nannies from the park  maybe get into that agency where they both work  and how do you plan on doing that  its not like you can pretend youre a nanny  the agency does do extensive security checks on who they hire  but not necessarily on the parents who hire them  come on buddy what do you say  do a little cameo onmy two dads  that show was canceled for a reason shawn  im sorry youre gonna have to find someone else to coparent with  i was gonna let you be greg evigan  i just think that startek security is a dead end  okay all right fine what if i go investigate a different  yes i know that you are lead detective lassiter  oh going through a tunnel  gotta go  please let me eat my frustration in peace shawn  theres this dark cloud surrounding you  its starving your chi yeah  and down at the station i can see a raccoon  with dark circles under his eyes  no her eyes oh god its the chief  chief vick is becoming chief coon  and shes shes lashing out at everyone   thats true  especially lassie  who in turn is taking his frustrations out on you  look jules you gotta take your chi back  take it back  and that means doing something big  something risky something thatll help you blow this case wide open  marry me juliet  what are your opinions on ferberizing the baby  oh my god never  thats disgusting  do you have any remedies for teething pains  two valiums  you would give the baby valium  oh no of course not  those are for me so i can deal with the crying  i just give the baby half a valium  look jules you dont actually have to marry me okay  just just pose as my wife when we go to the red balloon nanny agency  i need to get a better psychic vibe on a couple of their nannies  and you need a nanny why  two particular nannies  i think theyre behind the robberies in the heights  so youre saying that this string of hightech cat burglaries  one that ended in murder  were caused by a couple of 19yearold nannies  dont be ridiculous only one of them is 19  the other ones a slightly zaftig polish nanny in her thirties  shawn i cant help you do this  oh no no no you wouldnt be helping me  i would be helping you  to solve the case the way you think it needs to be solved  jules to get your chi back investigate these nannies with me  otherwise your chis going to shrivel up and starve to death  you need to feed your chi  besides i wasnt going to say anything  but i had a vision of us being married  i know its probably this undercover thing  were gonna do but it might have been a vision from our future  mr and mrs juliet spencer  ohara  fine  ill do it  she said yes everybody  she loves me so much  but only for detective work  i dont buy into this whole husband and kids thing  marriage is just a contractual obligation  that the state mandated centuries ago when wives were considered property  but if we are going to pretend  this is what our wedding was like its sunset on a beach in antigua  so then i walk down the aisle to an a cappella version of james taylors only one  and by this time the flower girls have tossed the peony petals into a soft   butterfly formation  hi  ill take you in to see the head of the agency now  hi im abby daniels  and it says here that you are mr and mrs levon tostig  thats correct  why dont you tell me a little bit about your child  well we had little millicent in a home birth with a doula  and afterwards levon here  buried my placenta in the backyard  some of our nannies are very environmentally conscious  theyre into homeopathic methods   great  what kind of background checks  do you run on these nannies  well im glad you asked that because the safety of your children  is something we pride ourselves on here at red balloon  i like that very much  well why dont i show you a little bit around our offices  and you can see some of the services that we offer here  great  so getting any psychic vibrations on your two suspects yet levon  i think i got thrown off picturing your placenta  now this is steve hitchcock  hes in charge of the baby bonding cameras we install  part of every nanny placement package  what are baby bonding cameras  well theyre a series of web cams we set up in your home  you can log on any time during the day  and see how your child and the nanny are doing   so youre spying on them  oh no not at all  the nannies are aware these cameras are installed  its more to keep in touch with your child  not to mention having the nanny know you may be watching her at any time  it encourages her to be extra responsible  youre the only ones with the access to the camera feed  you sign onto the web site using a unique password only you know  so you can see not only do we run  extensive background checks on our nannies you can check on them whenever you like  ooh uh sweetie why dont you tell them how we decorated little millies room  then theyll know how to set up the cameras  excuse me  well we decorated with a raspberry and sage theme  and then we did this pinstripe wallpaper that really accented the sea foam green  that we had done in the crown molding  perfect timing gus  a nanny wouldnt be able to afford coach sunglasses am i right  of course i love what nate berkus did on oprahs nursery theme week  so i took his idea and i did the long flowing curtains  but only on two of the windows even though theres four  hon we should probably get going  great  well if you have any other questions you just let us know   thank you i will  or email  e mail is good too  ohara  uhhuh where  okay ill be right there  that was lassiter  wants me to meet him at some exotic reptile shop on central  said they found some of the stolen merchandise from the robberies  ooh can i come id love to see what my wife does at work all day  and then before every nap time  we read good night moon and the giving tree  those are my favorite books  and then she lies down for a 45minute nap  which i keep track of in my client sleep chart  i love charts  when can you start  all right whend the items come in  jeez louise does it look like i keep records in quicken in here  maybe tuesday  can you at least describe the person who sold them to you  you get used to lookin at lizards all day  people all start to look alike   was it a man or a woman  boy you ask some toughies   i think it was a guy  pasty white guy  beatnik haircut stupid grin  i dont think so  was he rolypoly like a puffer fish  spencer what the hell   yeah yeah he was  now im seeing red  was he redfaced like a kol fish  exactly  and did he spit a lot like a komodo dragon  just like a komodo  great ill take this description down to our sketch artist at the aquarium  all right tell me exactly which items this fish man sold  your vision kinda sounds like that redfaced guy  from the red balloon nanny agency steve  i was thinking the koolaid guy   but yours probably makes more sense  yeah  im going to head back down to the station  investigate them a little more see if i can get a warrant  so its not the nannies that are responsible for the burglaries   its the agency  yeah  gus im so glad you called youre about to be a lot gladder  chief vick has officially forgiven us i just found her a nanny  oh thats perfect  i think i just figured out who the bad guys are  the best part is she can start right away  her security check is already done because she works for the best agency in town  oh no  please dont say the  red balloon nanny agency  this is the part i hate waiting for warrants  oh were not waiting for warrants  can you please tell me what were doing here  look gus we know the ws of the crime  we know the who we know the where were pretty solid on the where of  were pretty sure of the where to for   were scratch on the what chamacallit  shawn   cause thats selfexplanatory  shawn  we dont have the how  why do we need to know the how if the guys gonna be arrested  dude im the one that has to do the wrapup remember  you want me to get up there with eggs benedict all over my face  the canadian bacon in my hair hollandaise dripping down  i needzing im a psychic i gotta see everything  come on  oh hi levon what are you doing here  this is samuel coen  hes my best friend and godfather to my little millicent  now hes uh very overprotective and he insisted on coming by and getting a feel  for the folks that are going to be caring for his little goddaughter  oh well guys im so sorry  but steve and abby theyre out doing home interviews with clients  you know what were okay with waiting  dude she has a headache  start whistling something by philip glass  okay you know what guys you dont have to wait out here  you know i bet youd be more comfy in mrs daniels office   you sure its no trouble  no no not at all  you know where it is right  thank you   what kind of clues are we looking for  any kind   somebody chews tobacco  how about some new clues   what are you doing  dude i think this thing opens up  scratches on both sides of the wall its like a secret door or something  nicely done gus  these are feeds from the baby bonding cameras that the agency installs  its kind of creepy  yeah especially since the only ones that are supposed to be able  to access these feeds are the parents themselves  this is our proof shawn  they watch the footage from the cameras get the security codes see where people  are hiding their valuables and case out their houses  we got it shawn lets go   whoa  what  no that doesnt make any sense  none of the houses that got robbed had nannies working in them  dude it wasnt the houses with the nannies it was the houses next door  juliets gonna have a hard time serving the warrant  here at the red balloon when the person shes trying  to arrest is sitting in chief vicks living room  sweet black licorice ive got the how  ive got to get jules on the phone right away  time is of the essence here  jules its shawn  first of all how are you  oh that sounds nice  secondly meet me at chief vicks house pronto  ive had a big vision top seven of all time  lets go  thanks for getting here so quickly guys   wheres your baby gift  a what  the baby gift  lassie were about to enter the chiefs home  you cant just barge in guns a blazing this is delicate  the suspect could be holding chief vicks baby  or we could make chief vick very very angry   you dont want that  nobody wants that  probably shouldve given you this sooner but uh happy baby gift  uh thank you  its a mini rattle and also a low calorie breath freshener  oh great is there anything i can do for you guys  we just wanted to say hi  oh uh shawn im glad that youre here  i just wanted to apologize for snapping at you the other day  chief theres no need really  oh well you know i was just so mad i just wanted to strangle you  but i admit i was wrong  i realized i was overreacting after i tried to run  my husband over after he left the garage door open   but this agency that you and gus found  yeah about   mrs vick  yeah  i just finished up installing the cameras  guess who just fell asleep   iris is sleeping  like a lamb  please tell me that your other nannies are as good with children as you are  even better   you guys did a great job  yeah about that  mr and mrs tostig  i didnt realize you knew mrs vick  mr softy would like to say a few words  oh shawn i really dont think that this is the time  i thought his name was levon  whats that  the bear snores really loud hes pretty sure the turtles really an alien  and all the monkey wants to do is play pull my finger  oh and somebody just put in some video cameras  yeah i just set up a bunch of them so  well theyre not normal video cameras  theyre all hightechy with armygrade resolution  what whats that fella  look up  thats just a fan silly  lassie whats that  this is the extella 5400  theyre the baby bonding cameras so you can check in  the extella 5400 retails for over 10000  im fine  im seeing angles and pivots and divots  well no divots  but it sure is fun to say those backtoback  pivots and divots and pivots and divots and pivots and divots and  who wants to give that a shot   give what a shot  shots thats it exactly  but i dont see any shots of nannies playing with babies  in fact theres no babies at all im seeing jewelry boxes and safes  and entrances and exits and security keypads  but but from where   from the houses next door  what are you talking about  theres a baby sleeping  im talking about  shawn will you stop  well its like a mine field  im talking about casing out houses  next door to the ones your nannies work at  im talking about a string of robberies one of which went terribly wrong  when all of a sudden your witnessless crime got witnessed  and then it became murder  that ridiculous  is it as ridiculous as having a secret panel in your office  where you can plan all your robberies  you had access to each and every one  of those baby bonding cameras and you manipulated them  not to check on any nannies but to case the houses  next door to capture security alarm codes  so you could break into those houses undetected  id say thats pretty ridiculous  though not as ridiculous as denise richards  playing a nuclear physicist named christmas jones in a bond movie  but still  look i dont know what this guys deal is but we gotta go  this guys deal is that hes a psychic who happens to work for the police  oh really  yeah really  the santa barbara police department which im the chief of  anybody ever tell you you look like a puffer fish  sorry   i cant believe it all worked out  i know  all i had to do was get the fruit bowl assortment  from garrett bells jelly bean factory and every flavors delicious  im talking about with chief vick  her nephews transferring to a nursing school in santa barbara  in two weeks shell have her old nanny back  mm pomegranate  i wonder what shes going to do in the meantime  oh i took care of that  you mean after i scoured the city and couldnt find anyone you just stumbled  upon a nanny responsible enough for chief vick  that i did  give me a little whoop whoop  and you gotta admit the man knows how to work a baby  shawn  dont look back just keep walking  shawn shawn  where are you going  come
