                okay come on move it out  listen franks  you have the right not to get shot  make the wrong move  you lose that right  put down the bomb  good move  we recently obtained intelligence of a bomb plot  by an antigovernment radical  his intended target was this very building  we owe the success of this investigation  and indeed our very lives to sergeant henry spencer  well done  sergeant spencer would you like to say a few words  no thanks chief  a police officer doesnt deserve any special attention  for just doin his job  you may be able to sense the electricity in the room  thats because our arrival usually signals that a huge case is going down   step in here please gentlemen  thats the chief  she likes the two of us very much   im sorry you are  oh sorry chief  i got roped into doing a silly interview with the independent  theyve been calling and begging for weeks and i finally relented   but you called me  and you called me back  which means were both right  the important thing is that you got your cover story  actually its page 64  depends on how you fold it doesnt it  she cant be in here so get her the hell out  come to think of it i think  youll probably get a better shot here through this window  now try to catch me with a good expression  preferably with this eyebrow raised  like so  or my serious face  bestcase scenario snap a shot when my signature look comes up  i call it senor gotcha  how will i know what that is  youll know good luck were all counting on you  lassie youre here i need you here  thank you  chief whats up  mr spencer as you may be aware a cal  california prisoners advocacy   are you okay  right as rain  long story short a handful of convictions  some of them decades old have been recently called into question  unfortunately the biggest one was a santa barbara pd conviction  so were reopening the case and launching a new investigation  now were hiring y  you to provide us with any psychic leads that you may have  now normally we dont devote department resources to this  but these are special circumstances  could you do the handoff again chief  thanks  oh no  what is it  its my dads biggest case  psych 3x05 the disco didnt die it was murdered    it goes without saying mr spencer that  your father is in no way to participate in this investigation  hes no longer on the force  and his meddling could compromise the case in court   do i make myself clear  yes you do chief  what isnt clear is why people always say it goes without saying  yet still feel compelled to say the thing supposed to go without saying   doesnt that bother you  no and frankly i could care less  now thats the one that bothers me  why do people say i could care less when they mean i couldnt care less  why dont you tell me how to properly say this  if you share any official information about this case  with your father or let him anywhere  near any new evidence  then the two of you will have to find another police department to work for  and i will personally see to it that each f you is charged  with obstruction of justice   you split an infinitive  good catch gus  you two realize i carry a gun right  that was perfectly elocuted  my dads gonna freak when he sees this  we have to go into stealth mode  no taking his calls this wont hit the news till tomorrow  that should give us a 24hour head start  hand it over  dad how did you get in here  the unlatched window the unlocked back door  maybe this key that i made you choose one  what do you want  i dropped by to share my new chocolate chip raisin bread recipe with you  what do you think  i know chief vick just gave you the new franks case  why dont you let me take a look at what youre hiding in that folder  so i can get moving on this  okay youre right chief vick did just hire us  but there is no way that im showing you whats in this folder  youre lucky im asking you i could do this the simple way  i could grab it  clean up any evidence of struggle before you and your friend knew what hit you   in some states thats child abuse  i think all of them  look chief vick  made it clear that you specifically were to come nowhere near this case  this shouldnt even be a case  the son of a bitch was let out on some microcrap problem with  my search warrant   everybody makes mistakes  there was no mistake  it was the 70s we did what we had to do  but only when we knew we had the right guy and i got the right guy  period  okay you got the right guy  still doesnt mean im gonna put you on this case  nor would i even want to  dad you have no idea how gus and i roll gus tell him  you know what you go ahead and handle this halfassed  like you do everything else but you bear this in mind  this case is important to a lot of people who could have died  if he had blown up our headquarters  it should be important to their family members too  never seen my dad beg before  thats how he begs  hes clearly not gonna let this go  so look if were gonna investigate this thing undisturbed  were gonna have to jump a few steps fill in the blanks when were done  we should go straight to the das office  beat you by eight minutes not too embarrassing  dad i knew you would come and try to investigate this on your own  do you have any idea how dangerous this is  why im a tax paying voting citizen therefore  i have a right to speak to any elected official such as the da i please  you dont have to be a   tax paying voting citizen do you  may i help you  yes my name is shawn spencer  i am the head psychic for the santa barbara police department   and that is my partner  yeah yeah thats his partner  methuselah honeysuckle which makes me old scratch johnson  we need to see copies  of the original court transcripts for the eugene franks case  im not sure i can release those  im getting a very soft cuddly vibe here  it seems like you and your wife are  theyre gonna have another kid  its a boy congratulations do yourselves a favor  dont call it shawn problems  more importantly  according to the freedom of information act  those transcripts are available for viewing  so  very well good point  ill have our records department make copies  thank you very much  you know youre putting a damper on the proceedings  you call it a damper i call it working  all right thats it come here  all right i need you to hear me okay  if you insist on staying involved in this case  there are going to be rules  i was hired by the police department  therefore it is my ass on the line and those rules will be made by me  you are no longer a cop  and unless you plan on going back to the academy  climbing the wall doing the obstacle  course where you shoot the bad guys but not the lady with the sack  or the guy with the cane or the squirrel with the tail and the big fat nut  that started off well  it really fell apart at the end  you should have had a name for the wall or something  what im saying is that you need to listen to me is what im saying  all right shawn point taken  you got a deal  that means youre workin for me now  why dont you grab some coffee for us  black two sugars  i dont understand you guys had to handwrite everything  what if you need multiple copies  well we had one computer but it took up the entire second floor  generally we would use the mimeo machine  how long did that take a week  all the hightech fancy gadgets they use today  dont solve crimes any better than we did  a good detective is born with all the tools he needs right here  hello chief whats the good w  my dad down at the das office  no ii dont think so  i think i can clear this up for ya chief  that wasnt my dad  that was phil collins  we saw phil down at the courthouse  my dad gets mistaken for him all the time  i dont look shawn i dont look anything like phil collins  no im im fairly certain about this chief  he was humming invisible touch if that helps you  no  i i wasnt aware that phil collins lives in switzerland  how does she know so much about phil collins  i dont know  yes i do hear you  i will make sure he stays away  love you too  do you see do you see   we have to be more careful  okay hot shot  all right i get it  tell me what you can glean from this  youd like to know what i can glean  glean  the da arrested after only submitting the initial evidence  correctamundo the evidence i uncovered in that department  was so strong the da didnt need anything else to get a conviction  but all the evidence is poisonous fruit because of the search warrant  this evidence yes  good thing i got a different warrant for the second round  the da didnt submit any of that stuff which means we can use that now  all the hightech gadgets in the world wont tell you that will it  we gotta get the chief  to let us into the county archives so we can take a look at that evidence   gus gimme your keys  that would be a no   ogletrees checking my mileage  well take my truck  no we wont that raises the chances of you being seen again  well have to take my motorcycle ive always wanted to try threesies  who wants the handlebars   gus feels like you  no  that shouldnt draw any attention well cab it  fine its funny  its usually me who cant show my face in public  just think the contents inside these boxes  could determine whether someone spends the rest of their life in jail  catch  better hope they dont reopen the handyman killer case  your fingerprints are all over the murder weapon   thats not funny shawn  dude im kidding  its not really evidence it was just lying here  well stop it you know im afraid that being wrongfully convicted  is the tragic way my story ends  would you two girls stop bitching and see what we got here  what is this stuff  various possessions personal effects of eugenes we found after he was arrested  all right what do we got here  pawn ticket made out to eugene  a few days before he was arrested  goldsteins pawn anybody  wait that place is still around  desperate people pawn things  lets see what eugene pawned and never got back huh  two new cases just came in  one involves an international diamond smuggling ring   sweet  bingo  the other involves fraudulent permits at a plastics factory  well ill leave it up to the two of you to decide who gets which   i am the head detective  who owes me  i covered your butt on last months paperwork  damn it  follow my lead mcnab  get over here  i dont know ohara i dont think hes ready  yeah i i dont think he is either  no im ready  all right  mcnab how would you like to do some real police work  id love to  now technically youll be working under detective ohara and myself but  well let you take the lead on this  it will be such a good experience for you  it might even earn you a spot on the detective bureau someday  wow thanks guys  this means a lot the fact that you think so highly of me   to trust me  we love you get back to work  this ticket is from  ran the shop  ill have to go look through the box  box  what do you think the box is  a giant room like in raiders  i think its a box  secret catacombs underneath the building like in national treasure  shame on you for knowing that  this is where we keep all the old unclaimed stuff from over the years   as i said a box  what do you thinks inside the box   will you calm down  i cant man theres stuff in there  all kinds of stuff old stuff shiny stuff secret stuff   how come youre not as excited as me  because im not a raccoon   you look like a raccoon  hey youre in luck  this ticket here  matches this old receipt  not a lot of info on it im afraid  i know what that   right your case  oh im getting something here  oh this is intense i can see eugene  hes desperate and hes sweating nervously  hes stinky he wants to get rid of something cover his tracks  hide where hes been he brings in the title to his car  that must be  right in there  right whose benefit was that for  dont ever question my methods in front of a civilian ok  never do that  come here  i always thought that eugene was gonna use the car in a bomb plot  that was a common mo back then he probably pawned the title   to cover his tracks  if nobody reclaimed the title  we would have sold it  we could use the vin number to track where it ended up  over the city or the state for that matter  thus increasing the chances that youll be seen by someone  you work with and you being caught by the police  unless  nobody recognizes us  i feel ridiculous  speak for yourself ive got this shirt at home   his mother used to love it  yeah like 30 years ago  kid i wore it to lunch last week  there it is  its been sittin in some old ladys backyard   for dang near 30 years  you got the keys   lets take a look inside  make me an offer and its yours  you gotta be kiddin  just give us a second here

let me go talk to him  you stand down popeye doyle  ill handle this  got about 450 here now how much is this gonna cost me   450  done  hes good  nice goin that was all of our money  thats what happens when you send in the one guy  whos never bought a car before   we had exactly enough  all right look at it this way  it isnt a car  its a time machine  this little kittys gonna tell us about eugene 30 years ago  well looks like a car to me  and if i bought it im drivin it  that means my same car rules apply  wipe your shoes before entering no slamming doors  no food  looks good up here  doesnt look like factory soldering  smugglers hatch  gotta get this down to the crime lab  let me guess this is where we take one step back before involving the police  we need to see whats on that film first  thats how we roll  i think i need a tetanus shot  got it  miracle anything came out  this guy really loved his car  after seeing it all cleaned up i like it too  in fact i love it  bingo you think these two other ones could have had something to do   with the bombing  from the ak47s theyre holding  they had something to do with something its worth checkin out  theres no telling where they are if theyre even still around  you know back then i used to have this snitch working for me  his name was pookie real weasel  the guy would turn on his siamese twin for a buck  if these two had anything to do with this   pookies the guy who would have known  sorry what   what was his name  pookie   do you know where we can find this  pookie  yeah his name is  his name is pookie wiggington and i know where to find him   whats so funny  stop please  nothings funny you just but youre keepin it real right now   right on  lets see if we can find pookie  see if he still remembers the70s  if that had been on purpose that would have been totally cool  i need to get that power steering fixed not to mention the seat is jammed  all the way to the front and makes my entire left side fall asleep  and remember tomorrow night will be  ladies night at the top flight dance club  where its the70s every night  dont worry  i think pookie remembers the70s just fine  by the way im just puttin this out there  once we resolve this case  preserve your legacy as a detective you dont have to say thank you   no biggie  course it is  heck let me say it right now  thank you  youre welcome  thats pookie  lets go  officer spencer  long time no see  what brings you gentlemen to my establishment  as you may have heard  the da recently overturned the conviction on the eugene  franks bombing case  maybe i heard  maybe i didnt  right  were lookin for information on a few people that might have used to run  with old eugene  sorry i dont know what youre talkin about  all right i know how this works  hit the other sock give him some money  no offense guys but i dont need your pocket change  i can see two of eugenes partners in crime a man and a woman  dangerous highly skilled with military weapons  but not us military  smuggled  weapons  i used to trip like that  always looking for the escape  pookie hes cool hes  psychic  really  then i can dig it spiritual   third eye  thats where it is  you guys are deep like me  gimme five  so listen you were dead on it  check this out  the cats you were describing ran with eugene all right  there were two of em derek ford white guy stringy hair  and his old lady  melanie  really fine i got shot over a white girl like that once  anyway they were together in a militant  organization with eugene called sag  soldiers against government  they were into all kind of radical stuff  why would eugene go all those years and not rat them out  word on the street was  that sag was ruthless  nobody dared cross them not even one of their own  so eugene was just a patsy  you didnt hear it from me no them suckers are dangerous  he had partners  my biggest bust  and i was wrong  everything hurts  you had to be a tough guy and go in first  lets just fill out the incident report and be done with this fiasco  what happened to you guys  the diamond smuggling case that detective ohara  wanted to take didnt go quite   as planned  that i wanted to take  youre the one who insisted on it mr headdetective  basically we conducted a stake out to catch  the smugglers redhanded but when we opened  the cargo container to seize the evidence  we discovered we had the wrong one  this one belonged to exotic animal smugglers  and it was filled  with wild marmosets   i hate marmosets  apparently they dont like   being shot at  no apparently not  all i can remember after that are  hundreds of those tiny  razorsharp claws and teeth  lower primate my ass i recognize a military formation  when i see one  youll be happy to know that case you gave me took a fun turn  thats great  it turns out that plastics factory was a front for reallife sea pirates   youre kidding  theyve been using hightech boats  and gps to rob freighters in the shipping lanes  now im teaming up with the coast guard for a showdown   of the santa barbara coast  on the high seas  appears so  gosh  im sorry buzz but  you need a certain level of clearance to work with the coast guard  its its department rules   really  im afraid were gonna have to  take over from here  but good work on getting us to this point   it was fun while it lasted  yeah  good work buddy   were gonna capture pirates  i know   almost makes up for the rabies shots  almost  lets face it shawn i blew the case   youre quitting on me  im not quitting  i just realized that maybe chief vick is right  i should stay out of it  dad this was your big case  my big case my big bust  you see thats the problem right there thats how i started seeing it  but in reality  its a santa barbara pd case   and always has been  you dont believe that  a good detective knows when to let it go  thats a lesson both you and i could learn right now   wheres your dad  hes not coming he says  its to protect the case but i can tell  its really bumming him out that he got fooled 30 years ago  i cant believe im about to say this  but instead of lording over him that this is our case our rules  we have to convince him that we cant solve this thing without him  how do we do that  most likely through the use of trickery  what kind of wood are we gonna use for these bookshelves  cypress  cypress really  its a good wood its what noahs ark was made of  you wanna use something that breathes a little more  dont worry well hit a lumberyard on the way there  at least i get a chance to use my new laser level  why are we stopping here  no reason i just randomly selected this spot  dont be a smartass youre reading an address of a piece of paper  were sitting in somebodys driveway whose house is this  actually were dropping in on some people that we know  shawn i think thats them   what the hell is going on  dont lose em go go  come on   so what do we do now  i dont know  ive never cornered anyone before  they better hope theyre not uneven in there  im gonna blind em with the laser shawn  may we help you  derek and melanie ford  or should i say soldiers against government  you sure your father doesnt want to come inside  hes clinically insane and a biter  sorry again about running from you guys  but when we saw the mercury cougar in the driveway we just figured  it was eugene coming after us for revenge  revenge for what  he thinks that we set him up to take the rap   for the police headquarters bombing hes been asking around town about us  trying to figure out our whereabouts  we thought hed finally found us  well dont you worry about that you help us with this investigation  we will make sure the police protect you from your old pal  thank you  tell him everything honey  after eugene got arrested 30 years ago we freaked out  and we stopped our radical ways  we became soldiers for government  we built this great life  you have to believe us we had nothing to do with setting eugene up  i mean we were all brainwashed  we were all caught up in the movement  do you know of anyone else who would have wanted to set him up  honey are you okay  i cut myself pretty good  excuse me im gonna have to go put something on this  sorry  we should get going  thank you for your cooperation and rest assured  eugene will not learn of your whereabouts thanks again   hope your finger feels better  thank you  good news pop the trail is hot again  like i said count me out  damn it dad do you have to be so prideful all the time  so you made a mistake 30 years ago nobody cares just get over it  not everybodys as comfortable screwin up as you are kid  im comfortable coz my mistakes is the only thing that was pointed out to me  here we go here we go would you put away the violin  i pointed out the good stuff  but usually you were too busy bragging and showing off to take notice  enough im sick of you two fighting all the time  listen mr spencer  shawn needs you on the case because frankly youre old  and we were barely even alive during the70s  and shawn your dad needs you on the case  because even though you can be annoying  you actually have a brilliant idea every now and then  but youre too damn stubborn to admit you need each other  now can we go please thank you  is he always such a knowitall   you dont know the half of it  very preachy  so tell me what you have    how do you know that    whod want to set up eugene  she cut herself right there right there on the spot  no maybe they were telling you what they wanted you to know  not what you needed to know  i think theyre protecting somebody from eugene  but there were only three people in the picture  no there was four  the three of them and whoever took the picture  maybe theyre protecting an old mentor  im pretty sure that eugene met derek and melanie  when they were all students at santa barbara university  lets see if they shared any professors or advisors or ras   ra thats a thing right  it is  okay lets do this  back to undercover  got it thank you jules  all right according to juliet  university records show that our sag members only shared one professor  and that is dr richard colbert  i think eugene got here before we did  ive been waiting for you guys  yeah we got your call when we were out on the open ocean  chasing down our sea pirates at flank  thats a nautical term for maximum speed  we cordoned the private vessel before they could club haul  thats the nautical term for evasive maneuver   and make it to international waters  that sounds awesome   what do modern sea pirates look like  we have no idea  once you get three miles out its out of our jurisdiction  so the coast guard has us sequestered  to a tiny windowless cabin on the lubber deck  yeah apparently thats a nautical term for place they send you to puke   had to wash my hair three times  still sorry about that  lets do this  so what do we have here  the deceased is one dr richard colbert  male 60 years old professor of chemistry  apparently he died from a lab accident  involving poisonous hydrochloric acid fumes  when will people ever learn that alcohol and hydrochloric acid dont mix  technically they do  see the hydrogen atoms in the acid form a loose bond with the chlorine  what the hell are you wearing  im gettin some serious jive and it is fly  i can see the struggle theres a rag on colberts face  it was him who masterminded the bombing  he set eugene up  and eugene has murdered him  in revenge  but wait  theres more  the field is strong  i am gettin it and it is a bad mother   shut your mouth i can dig it  im havin a vision  its a big birthday cake   make a wish  what  bomb eugenes built another bomb  he built it here in the lab thats how hes gonna exact his revenge  on the remaining members of sag weve gotta stop him now  thats all i got the jives over we should go before people explode  found him lookin around out back must have hidden this under the house  we got a bomb  which hasnt been activated  call the bomb squad  eugene looks like youve been up to your old tricks  im only here because they called me saying  they were finally ready to come clean  invited guests dont go snoopin around the back  i was just checking to see if anybody was home   i swear  save it for the trial  youre under arrest for the murder of richard colbert  wait wait  colberts dead  and the attempted murder of derek and melanie ford  thank god you stopped him in time  i cut myself pretty good i need to go put something on this  maybe they were telling you what they wanted you to know  not what you needed to know  lies lies lies  lies  you two  you were two young kids in way over your head  with the militant sag  so you used eugene as a scapegoat didnt you  set him up to take the fall for the police headquarters bombing  so you could make a clean break  but then you heard he got out early and you were afraid hed  hed come track you down and expose your criminal past  about us  trying to figure out our whereabouts   found us  because of the four members of sag  only two of you are doin okay for yourselves  eugene has lost 30 years  and he will be marked as a criminal forever  and dr colbert his drinking destroyed his career  but you two  your life is pictureperfect  and you would kill to protect it  first it was dr colbert  his guiltridden conscience and drunk mouth  would cause him to confess everything to eugene  and then the plan was simple  frame eugene for that murder  and then blow eugene up  right along with all the traces to your past  so you could move on to a very bright white pickety future  thats a preposterous theory   preposterous  you have no proof  really  what if i did somethin like this  spencer what did you just do  in exactly one minute we will all be blown to smithereens  or the people responsible for making that bomb  will deactivate it  dont look at me hes crazy  i dont know how either  i demand that someone disarm this bomb right now  arrest them  come on  go  spencer id appreciate it in the future if you just played with your own life  come on lassie  if derek hadnt caved i would have just deactivated it myself  very easy  you just clip the red wire and the green wire at the same time   there is no green wire  really  in that case we all would have died  i am starving  whos up for fajitas my treat  come on you guys not everybody would have died  a couple of people would have lived  those are the the odds are that at least one  gus would have made it  itll only take a few minutes for me   i still dont see  drag me into this  i told you theyre gonna wanna hear about my last case  which was originally your case and without you   it wouldnt have been solved again  interviews press hair  those are your things  a little attention isnt gonna kill you   one more thing  what  thank you   down to zero we held our ground  and i looked those culprits in the eye and they knew that their time was up  we dont seek out the highprofile cases  they just have a way of finding us   well we should just show her  thats a great idea   you were there you were here  i was here  no we walked up and then they walked out   they did  yeah they came out with the   so they had the bomb  no they really did  they didnt know it was a bomb
