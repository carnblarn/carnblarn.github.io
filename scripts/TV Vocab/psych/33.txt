chillax  why would two people who just killed someone  be so casual smiling dancing  i agree it is both surreal and disturbing  to watch two murderers do the cabbage patch  but thats the point  theyre trying to look as casual as possible  but im not fooled  the question is why are they sticking around  looking for info on our beloved couple  anything that might say future killers  what does that word even mean anyway  greatness its like they purposely set you up for failure  i mean what have i done in my life that anyone would say was great  dude the perfect coa roundness of your head alone

choice  dad  what are you doing here how did   how did you even get in here  place was open  your mom and i were just looking around   shes in the bathroom  so what you just  you just thought it was a normal thing so sit here in the dark  i used to fix up cars in this very place  when i was in high school  i actually dropped the tranny out of a 57 chevy just like this one  practically rebuilt the thing from scratch  when that thing was done baby ill tell you it purred  now i feel awful   why  mom  shes still in the bathroom she missed that entire story  its not my fault that you never cared about anything in high school  yeah well as it turns out it seems i did care about something  i guess it doesnt matter much anymore  dad do you think you can miss out on a moment   what do you mean  like an opportunity  you think you could miss an opportunity in a moment  you know and then its too late  and the course of your life is changed forever  yeah absolutely  wait a minute is this about a girl  maybe  life is not made up of a single moment  its made up of a gazillion moments  what defines us is the choice we make  in the next moment and the one after that  these moments shawn theyre happening  theyre all around us all the time  youre having one right now  i just keep wondering like what if id made a different choice you know  like on a particular night in one of these moments   who would i be now  well i suspect that you  wouldnt be you  good talk dad i gotta run  actually there is one more thing  do you think i could borrow your underpants  just just for like ten minutes  oh come on  were already in the car  these are these are iconic film references im making tonight   his name is peter colter class of 95  can we hurry this up  im due back in the gym to make my presentation  if chief vick knew i was running names for you guys   id lose my ass  we definitely dont want that to happen   oh wait i have something  what is it  well its not criminal but its an accident report  there was an accident on june 6th 1995   that was three days before graduation  peter colter was the driver  alcohol was involved he hit another vehicle headon  a man was thrown from the car 20 feet  we was rushed to the hospital survived in a coma  for seven months and eventually died from internal injuries  peter colter was then charged with involuntary manslaughter  and received six years probation but  there were two other passengers in the car with him   let me guess  howie tolkin and eileen mazwell  yeah howd you know that  because ive seen pretty in pink like 75 times  wait wait and heres something else  well its small but some petty theft that was out of state  shoplifting in fallon nevada which leads me to a restraining order  it was placed one month ago by eileen mazwell and peter colter   for what  harassment  peter wasnt driving the car that night it was howie  what and he took the rap for the accident why  a moment and a choice look howie and eileen killed peter  i know it all now   but no body no crime  seriously jules  that has to be on a poster around here somewhere   its just something we say  wait so we know who the killers are  we know who they killed but we dont have a body   where is it  well if i was just some average guy  without any superpowers id say i dont know why you asking me  but as head psychic of the santa barbara police department id say  i dont know why are you asking me  its still hidden somewhere at that school  ohara what are you doing here this late  i thought you were off tonight  yeah you know i was out stopped back by  i you know forgot my chapstick  which i now have   where were you at your prom  why would you say that  because youre wearing a prom dress   and are you two on a case  chief  because i dont remember assigning you one   what are you looking at  she was helping me i just made a bust   and who is that  that is a real schizoid  elizabeth reba davis aka mindy howland  womans been filling false prescriptions under fake names since 96  i see well  good work people  oh and by the way whatever it is  youre really working on youre not being paid for this   thank you for that lassiter  yeah sweet  look if you dont mind im gonna get back to this  i dont want to miss the mug shots im having fun  its the best date ive been on in a long time  he landed here we know that  theres no other entrance they couldve gotten into  unless they dragged the body 200 yards all the way back to the gym  wait a minute   that is the girls locker room  oh now that he remembers  how would they even get a body down there anyway  thats like a 13foot drop  theres only one way to find out partner  im gonna ease you down and ill be right behind you  you must be out of your damn mind   im not going down there first  are you kidding me  youre gonna do this to me now after ive laid all the ground work  now will you just get down there  i dont want to do it help me back up  what do you mean youre in   help me up shawn  all right  now you shawn  dude i am so sorry  i didnt realize ive had the keys all along   lets just get to it  okay indeed   lets find us a body  but first  lets both of us take a private moment  to pay homage to all of the wonderful things  that have occurred here over the years  dude its howie and eileen  thats why they havent left the reunion  they stashed the body but now theyve got to move it  yeah but where is it  did you hear that  i think theres somebody in here with us  i think it came from the stalls  nobodys there  check the lockers  do you have a stick or a small leaf  why would i have a stick  we gotta get this body to lassiter if im gonna accuse them of the crime  why dont we bring lassiter down here  yeah we come back and the bodys gone again come on  if tolkin finds us hes gonna strangle us  he strangles people  head or feet  were you girls able to get some punch  what are you doing tomorrow  flying to san francisco for work   you know im just here for a little while  yeah of course i just i  actually i thought you might want to see my elementary school   you did  yeah sure this is  this is only half the picture  yeah that was fun right  so it is now time to announce the reunion prom queen and king  howie tolkin  and his real life bride eileen mazwell  where you going  howie eileen come up here  this is exciting  congratulations  looks like history has repeated itself  those crowns sure are heavy  yes they are  heavy with lies  you see my fellow alumni one of your classmates  was murdered here tonight  his name was peter colter he was a smart kid  he was a wiz at fixing cars  he was also the water boy for the football team  the reason you probably dont remember him very well  is because he lived in their shadow  he worshipped them do anything for them  including taking a rap for a tragic car accident  that was actually caused by howie  and you let him do it because you didnt want to lose  your precious scholarship  poor peters life was stuck in that moment and he never recovered  thats why he didnt show up to take his yearbook photo  and thats why he moved away and ended up committing petty crimes  meanwhile the two of you moved on to ucla  you married your prom queen  probably never gave your old friend peter another thought  that is  until about a month ago  isnt that right eileen  seeing its no coincidence that the restraining order  the you filed against peter just happened to coincide with howie here  announcing his candidacy in the state assembly  peter couldnt take it anymore  he needed the truth to come out so he contacted you  you two did everything you could  to prevent him from coming here tonight but he came anyway  he wore his lettermans jacket  with his special state championship pin  still stuck in that one moment  he visited all his old haunts  made a stop at the auto shop  got a little upset when he saw the trophy shrine  built to celebrate you  finally he confronted you both on the roof drunk and upset  you couldnt let him uncover the truth  it was way too much to lose  so you gave him one final push  silenced him once and for all  three arrests in one night not bad  please tell me you have a body   its the furry sabercat backstage  great  stand up please  up  homicide howie ladies and gentlemen  and now id just like to take this opportunity  to thank someone whos not only responsible  for planning all of this tonight  complete with a rastafarian theme that you all embraced so heartily  but who is also the mastermind behind the solving of tonights crime  i know its true im the psychic  but often times my revelations are nothing but a cryptic mess  tonight for instance all i could see were scenes frompretty in pink  a giant rhombus in a tshirt that read soccer moms are easy  now i dont know what these things mean  but gus is somehow able to shape them into cold hard evidential facts  but that is not what makes him great no sir  burton guster has been my best friend since we were five  and maybe just maybe  if any of you can look yourselves in the mirror  and know that youve been half as good a friend  to someone else as gus has been to me  well you too can be considered great  give it up for my best friend burton guster  we mustve done something right  that was all you  you know thats not true  i must say that was quite impressive if youre that good of a detective  i can only imagine what sort of midwife you made  okay this is 13 years overdue but here goes  i know that you think that i didnt show up  the night i was supposed to meet you at the carnival  but the truth is i did  you were standing at the end of the pier  you were wearing a blue thinstriped baby doll dress  doc marten sandals black  you had a row of red butterfly clips in your hair  short jean jacket and the right pocket was ripped  because you always used to shove your fist in there when you got nervous  you were pacing back and forth that night  you waited around almost an hour before you walked away  these are our tickets to the carnival  i saved them  i was so nervous i choked  and you know what that hardly ever happens to me  but the truth is abigail i think i liked you too much  and somewhere in the back of my head i knew what that night would mean  and even how my life could be different now  if i hadnt let you walk away  but this is a different moment  and its a chance to make a different choice  and youre really amazing and i know we cant go back  in time but i do wish that there was some way that i  so ill just keep thinking and if theres anything  that comes to mind ill let you know that was really nice   pretty much perfect  yeah  pretty much perfect  so where do we go from here  i dont know  maybe this is what  closure feels like  maybe  i guess ill see you at the 20year reunion  yeah though knowing gus itll probably be our 23rd  dear leland bosseigh high administrative board  we accept that you are withholding our deposit of 1500 for damages  we also accept that you just see us as you want to see us  in the simplest terms in the most convenient definitions  a snarky psychic an uptight pharmaceuticals salesman  a pretty female blonde detective  and a not so pretty unusually lanky detective  but each of us is all of those things  plus our normal fee for solving a murder  in one meaningful evening is twice that  so enclosed is a bill for 3000  please remit payment in the form of a check  made out simply to psych  for seriessubcom
