separated estranged   embattled  yes  and all alone for the holidays  all right  who keeps telling people i want snow globesfor christmas  dude i am really stoked  in over 20 years of friendship i can count  on one shop teachers hand the number of times  your folks have had us over  i assume its because they cant stand my father understandably  well i wouldnt necessarily say that  what would you say necessarily  lets just say its not because of your dad  your house is too small   didnt have enough extra chairs  no   hiding a jewish family in your attic  no  wait a minute  its not because of me  gus  i cant believe this  i feel like pe le pew when he looked up pew in the dictionary  le pew whuh  no  my parents always thought you were a bad influence on me   understandably  a bad influence   yes  dude thats absurd  because of you shawn i got my first b broke my first curfew accidentally killed  the state bird  how was i supposed to know he couldnt hold his own liquor  now i know what to get your parents for christmas  what  im gonna lead em on a walk down memory lane  and give them the gift of seeing what a positive influence  i have been on their son  dad why do you insist on getting a real tree  you probably chopped down some poor animals home  yeah thats the vicious little bastard right there   can we go please  whoa shawn shawn  look i dont wanna be late to the gusters its important that this dinner go well  arent you forgetting something  your gift  go on shake it rattle it feel it sniff it  do whatever the hell you want with it before it goes in that stocking

very happy still being a sales rep  i am  pharmaceutical sales is a very desirable field  of course and youre doing very well for yourself  thats 100 boy  no not gonna happen  turkeys ready   finally  it smells good winnie  why smell it when you can taste it  speaking of smoked turkey you know why gus isnt a smoker  cause when we were kids i made him smoke  an entire pack of cigarettes and he discovered he hated the taste  pretty good influence if i do say so myself  probably what gave him asthma  probably what stunted his growth too  im fivetenandahalf  we hear you son  we hear ya  gus youre tall enough shawn youre an idiot and to be fair  theres a lot of complicated causes for asthma  now lets eat  you know it was actually gus asthma medication  that first interested him in pharmaceuticals   so youre welcome for that  you made your point shawn   youre a good friend  yes youre very close  so close i wonder if he wouldnt be married by now  if he wasnt spending so much time  with you  trust me i get mine  i mean im just waiting for mrs right  we at least thought youd have a house by now  i have time the markets still cooling off  yeah sos the food  you wont have time if you keep using  all your extra energy with this gypsy  detective agency nonsense you two have cooked up  mrs g  its a psychic detective agency  psych  and how does this differ from that pet baptism business you had as kids  first of all that was an llc and im the one that let gus believe  that jesus was black the whole time we were grow  growing up which of course he is  he is that  that he is that  i say we skip old man fullers house  nobody wants to sing to his old mean behind  cant hear the song over his cussing anyway  oh come on you guys  were all adults now  cant we let bygones be bygones  even old man fuller can use some christmas spirit  come on  o we wish you a merry christmas o  o we wish you a merry christmas o  o we wish you a merry christmas o   o and a happy new year o  mr fuller  he would have been throwing rocks at us by now if he were here  o we wish you a merry christmas and a happy new o  psych 210 guss dad may have killed an old guy  o i know you know that im not telling the truth i know you know o  o they just dont have any proof o  o embrace the deception o o learn how to bend o  o your worst inhibitions o o tend to psych you out in the end o  the dream team synchronizators  flolo akazab  yeah its an apparent suicide but uh were still working the scene  dude what if this wasnt suicide  what if this was murder  shawn its christmas time   can you please leave work at the office  theyve already moved on  look there is no way that an 80yearold man  in fullers condition could have hoisted himself  over that bannister  and check it out  he was clearly looking forward to watching some tv tonight  while he ate his lobster   you may be on to something  plus i psych it up nice for your parents  they might be impressed you know  throw in a little razzle dazzle  maybe they realize im not such a bad influence after all  which may get them off my case for deciding to go into business with you  now youre feeling me you convertible lebaron  are you guys coming or what  sure thing pop  stop  im sensing something  what is it shawn  is it like the other 26 and a half crimes we solved for the police department  im sensing a struggle  oh please  fullers unconscious  no he was just an old man with a little soft skull  oh someones wrapping a rope around his neck  what im sensing here ladies and gentlemen  is murder  spencer old people are always offing themselves during the holidays  well according to csu shawn might be right  colorado state university  crime scene unit   them too  let me see that  blunt force trauma signs of struggle  my lord  he really is psychic  maybe we were wrong about the boys working together  this time  right get him outta here  its an open crime scene people  i need witness statements from each and every oneof you carolers  crap im running late  lassie come on man handle your business  gus and i will take em down to the station tomorrow   we have passes  which practically  makes us coworkers isnt that right big l  that hurt man  but when they cut us we bleed blue  carlton  hi  im so glad you could make it  i hope youre in a hogmanay moodi doubt it  whatever that is  the first footer  oh the first footer its scottish tradition  to celebrate the first visitor of the holidays  you  why are they all staring at me  well the first footer traditionally brings a gift of food  all ive got is a cliff bar in my car  id really prefer to save it for my morning run  so these are my nephews  drake finn and isaac  boys this is detective lassiter  he works with auntie julie  i like it better in here already  i was helping them with their christmas crafts  its always my favorite part  look at this auntie julie   look at mine  oh my goodness  this looks fantastic but you know  maybe detective lassiter would like to help out  sure  all right fellas what do we got going on here  well you know drake technically jesus was born  around april so we need to get rid of this winter foliage  oh and finn the word manger actually refers  to the wooden feeding trough that the animals used  so lets put baby jesus in this little shot glass  perfect well you know  based on how far they had to travel  all the experts agree that the wise men didnt really  get there until jesus was two so lets get rid of them  uh uh carlton  remember this is for the children  right  lets do one with santa in it  hand me kris kringle there guys  thats a great idea  you know interestingly enough the dutch version of santa  used slaves to deliver the toys  were here to give our official statements for the fuller case  yes about that  um our investigation has confirmed mr spencers hunches  ah really   it was murder  thats 27 and counting  do you folks mind coming on in for a moment just have a seat  make yourselves comfortable  chairs right over there  i thought we could uh have more privacy this way  why what is there a problem  well this report says that there were traces  of weed killer found in mr fullers system  poison  i sensed that as well  theres just one slight problem  we found a box of the same type of weed killer  on mr gusters property  can you explain that  whoa whoa now slow your roll i can explain that  me and fuller had a longtime feud about the property line  and every now and then id poison his shrubs  because he refused to cut them back  bill thats not like you  how about this blunt force trauma to the head of the deceased  was done caused by a bloody hammer found nearby  with prints belonging to a mr william guster  yeah but if youd looked a little closer  you would have found a hacksaw and a pickaxe with my prints on them too  fuller had been taking my tools for years  thats another reason wed been feuding  another perfectly reasonable explanation  just one more thing the rope  to hang mr fuller matches rope   used from a boat belonging to  lemme guess me  dad youre crazy  mr g  wait  you mean it really was mine  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa  look i just said that to be funny  i have no idea how it got there  i am sorry mr guster the evidence is strong enough   you have the right to remain silent  what  you give up that right anything you say  you cant arrest me   and will be used against you in a court of law  im a deacon in a church   you have a right to an attorney  what is the lord gonna say  its very nice of you to invite us over  oh winnie its the least i could do   now when is bill gonna be released from custody  soon i hope  a thing like this could be devastating to somebody  with delicate health a weak disposition  were gonna get dad out before anything can happen to him  i was talking about you  your fathers strong as an ox but you  lord knows you have enough stress to deal with as it is  mrs g you have my word everything will be fine   were gonna take this case  yeah  shawn maybe we oughta get some food together here   maybe you oughta pass on this one  i cant dad i owe it to them  look the gusters are nice people okay  they invite you over for dinner at 600 they dont serve till 630  so what  the point is as a rule  you never wanna get involved in a case  where personal relationships are involved   dad i think i can handle it  what if guss dad is guilty  are you out of your mind how could you even say that  thats what i mean right there shawn  youve already made your decision irrespective of the facts  you have already compromised this case  compromised why  because im not afraid of my own emotional attachment  ill have you know that i view that as a tool in my problemsolving not a liability  it is that exact kind of lameass thinking  i can see why you were never a detective  and i can see why you ended up a divorced detective  my god  we went almost three hours without having an argument  its our best holiday in years huh  uh i was just arresting someone in the neighborhood  i thought id drop by and say hi  oh you know we just sat down to lunch so  sorry  hey guys  look what ive got  a wii  awesome  wow thats actually very thoughtful thank you  it turned up in a sweep i mean theyre welcome to use it  but technically it belongs to the das office  come on lets play boxing  youre not busy  no no go right ahead  oh oh drake youre too slow my friend  you better change your name to lassiter because i own you  oh hes down on the ground   what a lameo  come on  whos next whos next come on  lets go somebody come get some whos next  get some come on  you guys sure you dont wanna take a sandwich or anything for the road  you hardly ate any of your food  ooh i remember once when we were little you made us   these chicken cordon bleus  shawn   but the ham was so thin  shawn  we dont have an appetite  all we can think about is clearing dads name  and getting him out of jail  ill give you a call as soon as we have any leads  dad  no it is not an engraved set of rubber bullets  why would i possibly give you another excuse to shoot a gun  well you better keep thinking  shawn i dont have to tell you how important this case is  so whatever you need just let me know  hold up hold up hold up what what is it  give me a second  is it a clue that clears my dad  can you shush for one second  i know you think this is easy for me  but i do go through a mental process like a equals b  b equals c  which means a equals would you stop it  thats too close now i gotta start all over  damn it shawn whats taking so long  okay all right  we need to figure out if there was a homeowners association  ah mr mitchell   yes  my name is shawn spencer  im not interested in any fake vacation packages  im not giving you my social security number  so i can claim the grand prize and im not paying  for any damn subscriptions for magazines that i know ill never see  im the head psychic for the santa barbara police department  well come on in then  were investigating the death of mr fuller  and i am sensing some unresolved conflict between the two of you  something something to do with rules and violations  yes its true  fuller became a constant thorn in my side  ever since i started the homeowners association  he refused to follow the ordinances  when id give him citations hed tear them up and throw them in the trash  so id give him another citation  it was a constant vicious cycle  its him  he did it bust him shawn  see it see it  see it stop it  sounds like you wanted him out of the way  no no not at all  he was a pain but he was our best supporter  our  the mitchell family  we founded this neighborhood  now were lobbying the city to have them declare it a historical district  fuller refused to sell his house after all these years  we were the only friends he had  hello  oh hi honey this is shawn spencer and burton guster  i remember the two of you from when you were no more than yea high  you had the cutest little lawnmowing business  oh wow thats right we did  in fact i think we paid you 500 for a job that never got done  oh this guy  you know the yard tools are out back ill go get them  shes uh shes not serious is she  she is  oh and make sure to water the gardenias  ive had them longer than youve been alive  this is ridiculous  she shouldve just accepted the 500 refund offer  we need to be solving my dads case  dude  theres somebody in old man fullers house  i cant believe were gonna bail on the mitchells yard again  come on  who are you and what are you doing here  i should ask you the same thing  my names shawn  this is my partner skooney uturn singleton  were from dirty boy landscaping  i got a call from your office said you needed some estimates  on some renovations  you guys are fast  i just left word at the office saying i needed a landscape architect  you know i coldcalled this geezer for years  pushing him to sell and he always refused  finally its available  really  whats so special about this place  its the only lot in the neighborhood  with 360degree unobstructed views  itll sell for a fortune  dont worry this yard will be immaculate when were done   byebye  be in touch  you hear her shawn  shes been coldcalling for years  and she stands to make a fortune on this place  thats motive right  yeah yeah  its gotta be her what more do we need  lets get the cops on it right away  i i guess it wouldnt uh hurt  to have them do a cursory background check  maybe maybe look look at the phone records   right  okay  ill do everything in my power to make this process  as painless as possible  jules jules over here  its about time  did you check the phone records  yep your tip paid off  thats great thank goodness  there were all these vibes but i wasnt sure  so it was rosa   who  the real estate agent  no no  she has a solid alibi  but we discovered quite a few calls from someone else  who also made numerous cash transfers into fullers account  possibly paying off a blackmail  wait a second if youre not about to arrest rosa  what are you doing standing here  distracting you  distracting  sorry gus  shawn  shawn   no no no mr guster  mr guster  burton burton please dont make a scene darling  the neighbors neighbors are watching us  what is this  get in the car maam please   watch your head  dont  dont you touch my hair  we got here as fast as we could  this is our worst nightmare  it seems like everything is conspiring against us  so we lawyered up  thats how they say it in the bucket son  where i did an eighthour bid  i dont know those words  im not gonna do well in prison  dont worry sweetheart  youll be fine  she not gonna make it  i told you nobodys going to prison  mrs g  why didnt you tell anybody  that old man fuller was blackmailing you for all these years  i wanted to believe me i did but i couldnt  you see this all started when bills sailboat caught fire  i tried to muster up the courage to tell everybody that it was my fault  but before i could the insurance company had paid everything off already  well somehow fuller knew the truth of what had happened  he threatened to turn me in for insurance fraud  if i didnt pay him every month  well he was so old i figured paying him off  for the rest of his life was the cheapest route  to the police it looks like motive  i know  but dont worry son  we have called nana  shes to look after you in case anything should happen  to the two of us  mom  i dont need my grandmother who lives in a nursing home to look after me  we hear you son  we hear you anyway its just  until we can raise the money to post your mothers  bail and pay our legal bills  whatever the cost is ill cover it   dont worry about it  we appreciate the gesture burton  but son were talking real money  you have a savings account in a penny jar  i have a 401 a diversified assetallocated  portfolio full of securities and equity to tap into  hes always been so good with the big words  how much do you think we can get for the cutlass  stop it i cant take anymore  all of my life its been gus cant handle this  protect gus from that  well guess what  im the most responsible wellprepared  noncriminalrecordhaving adult in this room  and its high time you two stopped babying me  im 29yearsold  and by the way i know youve only been married for 28 years  i did the math a long time ago  so stop protecting me from that  starting now  im gonna take care of you  im gonna give you money  and were gonna solve this case  shawn may not have always been the best influence on me  but hes always believed in me even when i didnt believe in myself  and right now  i believe in him  we hear ya son  all right dude  you had your moment man you nailed it  now go ahead and make a timely exit  come on man  before you gotta make another speech  your mom being arrested might be  christmas miracle we need for the case  how so  i suspect she wasnt the only one  in the neighborhood that old man fuller was blackmailing  we gotta get back in his house  lets hurry up  this place gives me the creeps  bingo  this must be how old man fuller saw your mom burn your dads boat  dude theres something in there  what do you think it is  will you stop it shawn  you know how that story gives me the creeps  norman norman  norman  okay stop it thats enough thats enough   game over  fine  dont play shawn  just as i thought  he was snooping on the entire neighborhood from up here  these are his blackmail pictures  suburban pot farm  bootleg dvd ring  none of these are really cause for murder  covering an illicit affair  now thats what i call motive  what  you see anything  hurry up  i know where our culprit lives  hey got some questions for you about some illicit pictures  but we already know where you live  we call that sammy floyds tree house ambush  okay okay  okay you got me  ill give you your pictures back  we have pictures of you dude  the ones old man fuller was blackmailing you for   what pictures are you talking about  i work at a onehour photo  i thought you were asking about the pictures of hot  naked chicks i sometimes keep  wait a minute  this isnt you  no  but it kinda looks like my dad  from about 30 years ago when we first moved here  man it was an old picture mixed in with the new ones  we couldnt tell the difference because theyre all black and white  so were looking for his dad   yes  he passed away a few years ago  no  whos this woman in the photo  its not my mom thats for sure   she died before we moved here  who the hell is she  you know dont really feel comfortable talking about my family secrets all right  whats the name of that onehour photo where you hide your filthy debauchery  i remember my dad had a female friend who would visit only at night   what was her name  i dont remember   do you know she lives  no  can you tell us anything i just swung from a tree  when she left the house would smell like white linenperfume  i remember it because it was the same perfume  my mom used to wear when she was alive   so our culprit is a woman  apparently  who looked like that 30 years ago  shes hot  what  you have problems  you know i was thinking  if you guys have an extra seat at that table  for christmas dinner i might be available  carlton i havent been completely honest with you   you see family  say no more  dont worry  i wont come around anymore  i am so sorry carlton  dont be i mean its its totally natural for you to be jealous  if your nephews like me more than you   come again  i get it  youre used to being the cool aunt that everyone wants to hang out with  but when im around you just cant compete with that  sometimes i just i forget to dial down  my coolness when im around kids  theyre just so impressionable  you  are so right  i cant compete with that  hey dont be so hard on yourself  all right im sure your nephews still think youre  really fly  merry christmas carlton  great news  were

that you miserable old geezer  the cops have the wrong suspects  well then whos the killer  gladys mitchell   you used to deliver flowers  to the nice little widower who moved in down the street  one thing led to another  the next thing you knew you were locked  in a torrid illicit affair  dirty sweaty an affair that if it got  to the public would not only ruin your marriage  but soil the good name of the neighborhoods founding family  old man fuller knew your secret  he could see everything from his snooping perch  in exchange for his silence you had to cater  to all of his needs for the better part of 30 years  but oh that bastard just wouldnt die would he  no it was as if his meanness was keeping him alive  and then your worst nightmare became a reality  he started going senile  you couldnt risk him telling somebody about the affair  so you took matters into your own hands  and you killed the son of a bitch  thats absurd  i couldnt possibly hang a grown man from up there  i can see it  you tried to poison him  but he spit it out  then you panicked you grabbed a hammer  you tried to bash in his skull  but no he just wouldnt die  his little feet twitching this way and that  and then a really desperate move  you grabbed the disoriented fuller  you pushed him over to the base of the stairs  you found yourself a nice piece of rope  you tied one end around his neck  you draped the otherend over the bannister  and you tied it to the chair lift  and then you used that chair lift  to pull old man fuller  all the way up and over the bannister  at this ridiculous agonizing pace  and that  is how you killed that  ancient pruney relic  im so sorry honey  i just couldnt let him ruin everything  that we worked so hard to build  guster you can tell your parents were gonna drop the charges  good work shawn  youve already had your moment  all right lets light this puppy up  well shawn it looks like another draw this year  yes  it appears so  look at that
