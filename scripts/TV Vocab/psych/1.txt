arresting officer was my father he was trying to teach me a lesson  did you learn it  i learned i hated my father so sure  pardon me if im just a little skeptical  believable as it is that you solved all these crimes  im sorry what was it  watching the local channel 8 news reports  i confess thats not true  sometimes i watch channel 5 i prefer channel 8  the weather girl adorable  so youre telling

kidnapping  oh come on i had nothing to do with that  would you like to  the feds are itching to jump in on this case  and i need to make some progress  what i need is a miracle or a facsimile of one  i see i see well i make 1 200 a day   its a tryout  thats what i meant to say  this is pro bono something for you  and if this psychic thing is a scam  we will prosecute  you know hindering a police investigation is a criminal offense  sounds good  were on the same team now kidnappers beware  i have a job for you  i already have a job   theyre paying you to play video games  how do you do that  come on left hand space bar right hand arrow keys  gus you should ask me a challenging  question every once in awhile just for kicks  i cant go anywhere im behind on my route  i got new samples of ceromoxicyllan  oh man im sorry  i didnt realize the new butt cream had come in  so youre not interested in hearing about doing  the thing weve been dreaming of doing since we were eight  ive got us the last job we will ever need  shawn youve had 57 jobs since we left high school  yes i have and they were all fun  but this one takes the cake  oh yeah better than your acupuncture clinic  i didnt realize experience was necessary  what about the summer you spent driving the wiener mobile  i did that for the hot dogs  look gus all those jobs i took because i wanted the experience  but then i mastered it and i moved on  but this job has a little bit of everything   come with me  uh no  im never doing anything blindly with you again  i learned that at the mexican border twice  okay this is hard to explain but im going to give it a shot  you and i  are opening our own private detective agency  oh see  no explanation necessary  let me get my coat   but youre not getting your coat  uh no no shawn im not  all right you want to sweat the details  fine  the cops think im a psychic  and now we are investigating a kidnapping   youre serious  yes i am serious  six days ago camden mccallum jr sole male heir to mccallum textiles  was seen being forced into his range rover at the municipal dog park  no ones seen him or the dog since   they took the dog  you see what i mean  i need you  i need you to to write stuff down  cause you know how i zone out when other people talk   just for today  just today  oh and you know what you should bring your sample case  because some of those forensics guys  whoa whoa whoa  theres going to be forensics guys there  all right pay attention  mccallum ran his fathers  cigarette boat into the morro bay aquarium  that was right after he got caught with  that hockey players wife  yeah i remember that  guy hadnt been out of the papers in five years  since that day nothing  not a single news story not so much as a dented motorcycle  okay  what do you think  i think camden mccallum is too good at what  he does to stop not cold turkey anyway  beautiful women fast cars doesnt add up  something happened  how should we introduce ourselves  dont say psychic  theyll shut you off  say something vague like alternative tactics division   how about the bureau of magic and spell casting  where are you going   youre rooting through the trash  just for a second  you are without doubt the worst detective ive ever seen  gus everything you need is right in front of you  you just have to pay attention  oh yeah  look at this  berensons brand  that is the highest quality dog food on the market  perfect they pamper their pets the case is almost solved  this stuff is really expensive  no additives no preservatives  why would you possibly open three bags  simultaneously when you only have one dog  theyre rich they waste money   oh my god  what  this cd case is totally nice  why would someone throw this out here put this in the car  inside now  is it entirely too early for me to have a theory  can you at least wait until we see some evidence  i suppose i could if it would make you happier  whoa  just act natural   they know  how could they know   they know  we havent said anything yet   they know i can feel it  oh youre a psychic now too  youre not a psychic  gus lets just be clear on one thing  the only way they can absolutely prove  that i am not a psychic is if i tell them  and i can guarantee you  that is the one thing i will never do  ooh ooh ooh check this out  you got a lead  no but look at this girl  she must be the sister god shes incredible  kind of have a few other things going on right now shawn  oh gus look  look how she went from this awkward stage  with this really unfortunate perm to this beautiful

that damn thing didnt do anything without it  yeah thatll do it thank you sir  does he like his dog thats how you investigate  i think were making progress  since youve been here  all youve done is dig through the trash  hit on the victims sister and falsely accuse her boyfriend  gus he is not her boyfriend  she made a point to say theyre free to see other people  whatever you say shawn have a blast i quit  you cant quit we just got started  watch me  gus youre gonna miss everything  its gonna be fun  gus get back here  fine  ill solve this case by myself  gus  i hate to imagine what the rest of your plan was  how did you get in  far less effective on a secondfloor landing  what do you want shawn   can i ask you something about the case please  no   i was right  im done shawn  i dont want to commit felonies and perjury and pretend to be  youre dying to know who kidnapped him  i know you are  no no im not  because i dont believe that you can solve a crime  the cops cant by simply walking through a house   fine  fine  all right whatever  who kidnapped him  nobody  nobody excellent  call the chief at home tell her the crime is solved  because apparently we just imagined the whole thing  gus nobody kidnapped him because he did it himself  come on see for yourself  okay heres the thing  camden didnt offer to clean up his act voluntarily  oh no daddy threatened to cut him off permanently   this was about 18 months ago  18 months  but wait theres more he had help  who  this guy on the end malcolm orso  only member of this crew that  didnt go on to fame or fortune or rehab   the cops mustve talked to him  nope  malcolm hasnt been seen with camden for quite some time  to be exact   18 months  almost to the day  gus he has been planning this thing for over a year   shawn this is good  yeah   where did you get this  katarina mccallums room  you didnt go in her room  gus i needed a ride she hadnt eaten yet  one thing led to another and we ended up sharing a milk

checked this out  malcolm is so far out on the periphery of camdens life  hes not on the witness list hes not on anybodys list  this is a great plan  camden mccallum deserves to be commended   maybe

could possibly be used for evil  oh watch out watch out  for what its tongue  that thing could be vicious  yeah diabolical with its calculated decoy tail wagging  theres blood on its whiskers  thats not blood thats snausages   are you sure  yes im sure  either that or he just mauled a mountain lion  come on gus  mr spencer follow me  now if theres any press make sure you mention our agency   we dont have an agency  yes we do  i applied for a dba online  which reminds me were going to need a name  mind masters already taken  make sure you tell them that we do private cases  cause i bet the departments only  going to be good for one or two months  you tell them  i cant  im secretive mysterious enigmatic   delusional  remember act surprised  wow it is just like i saw before  pardon me

mistake this case isnt closed  pardon me  murder suicidecome on  youre buying that  im not buying anything  those are the facts  ill buy it  i understand  i do  youd like to shut the book on  this as quickly as possible its fine  they had a falling out  before they got the ransom money  why what did they have to fight about before they got the cash  might i remind you mr spencer you are not a detective  i just need to speak to the witnesses again  the mccallum family has been through enough  and this conversation is over  thank you  uh we parked in a parking structure  do you validate  would it make any difference if i  told you camden mccallum jr spoke to me  from beyond the grave  shut the door on your way out  damn it  what are you doing  that was the chief of police  interim chief  and have you considered that camden mccallum  may have been alive the first time we went to that cabin  no well i have  i need to talk to that guy  whoa whoa no  come on gus just for a second  the man is practically almost my fatherinlaw  make no mistake shawn i will kill you  okay i appreciate the fact that you think you can beat me up  but i think our last scuffle proves otherwise  are you talking about the cinnamon festival  yes you do remember  okay first of all i was six  and i had a cast  which many would construe as a clear advantage  its like having a weapon attached to your arm  oh great now the chief is staring right at us  mr mccallum  chief wants them left alone  well we all want to be left alone  yeah some more than others  whats with his wrist  you dont give up do you  i do give up all the time  but not until the moment is right  now come on i know you dont think this adds up either  okay the rumor is he tried to off himself  off himself  the war hero  the man whos seen everything  no thats not it  thats definitely not it  you know everything dont you  yeah its scary isnt it  something is going on and im gonna find out what it is  no youre not going

accident  what are you gonna do when you get caught  move out of town  im not going to get caught  shawn this is just like everything else  three months from now youre going to be on a bus going to minneapolis  cause you found your calling as a weather man  its not like that this time  have you been listening to me  i finally figured out a way to use my special gift  you should be thrilled

moustache rides  come on  i heard her boots  all right close enough  close enough no  i nailed that  yeah but you changed the rules  but hey if it makes you happy  change the rules  i did not change the rules  what i did was nail it and you know it  shawn you want my advice  go out get yourself a real job grow up  in the meantime  you might want to ask yourself  who youre trusting in this case that maybe you shouldnt  cause  obviously youre overlooking somebody  thanks for lunch  why are we at the mccallum offices  what is the magnification on these things   okay we need to stop at walmart on the way home  why dont you just take your big loud motorcycle  ooh here we go here we go  oh hell no  you got me out of work so you could stalk a girl  damn it what is he doing here  i cant believe this  whats up with his hair  its horrible  i knew i shouldve had him picked up for questioning  that is not the way a grown man kisses a grown woman  werewere fine  why does she look so nervous  oh no  is it just me or does that bag look  like its filled with stacks of ransom money  give me that  oh my god  katarina  it was her  youre dating a murderer  not exclusively  you see i knew there was a reason she went for you so easily  she wasnt lying gus  i know when people are lying  oh yeah  apparently not  you just got played  should we call the cops  too late for that  you could pretend you had a vision of a girl totally manipulating you  would you stop  what should we do  theres only one thing to do  oh you have got to be kidding me  shawn hey  what are you doing helping  youre supposed to stay at the car you didnt tell me  well come on  gus you locked the car  its a bad neighborhood  what in the worlds going on shawn  i know whats in the bag  you do  youre good very good  i didnt consider whod be the sole heir to the mccallum fortune  if camden was out of the picture  okay okay wh  you think i want my familys money  you dont need it do you now that youve got this money  weve got to get better binoculars  katarina  go buy the bag  what you want a souvenir of your ineptitude  i need to get a better look inside the bag  im not going in there  that guy wants to kill us  gus this guy works in a thrift store  okay hes a big furry hearted good samaritan  come on  ill be right here  go ahead  what the hell do you want  can i have the bag  you serious  just the bag  not the clothes  ill pay you for it  youve got some nerve coming in here  i cant believe this neither can i  ive gone to jail for less than you  jails no fun ill tell you that much  oh youve been  once in monopoly  okay hold on hold on  whos that  move move move move  hey get back here  you hey  go go go  i cant believe you sold me out like that  you didnt tell me i was a decoy  of course youre the decoy  seems pretty clean  what they didnt happen to leave a ransom note inside  give me some money get your own money  gus ill give it back  seriously this is all you carry  okay  so weve got five stacks going across  you figure four going long ways  ten stacks in each pile based on the wear and the indentation  depending on the denomination  uh this could easily be 5 million  youre kidding give or take  you got that from a groove on the side  come on gus any small child couldve figured that out  so somebody at that house did pay a ransom  mmhmm or tried too  who i dont know  were going to need more than my psychic powers to figure this out  here to scope out the new meter maids  nope i am here to see you  not interested  i know you you have someone special  hes married andor separated  is there a point to this mr spencer  of course you and i have something in common  whats that  we both know this case is nowhere near closed  unfortunately gut feelings arent admissible in a california court  how about motive  what do you have nothing yet  but ive seen something  seen or seen  well what do you think  okay what do you need  everything you have on malcolm orso  he was camdens accomplice  ill get fired  will you reallybecause it seems like a gray area to me  thats the problem with you mr spencer  you live your entire life in a gray area  thats not true  though i generally vacation in gray areas  we cant talk here  hold up  it says orso was seen in the town near the cabin  yeah twice  early in the week by a store owner  what was he buying  nothing the old man just saw him on the street  same old man sees him two times  mmhmm yeah  orso had one of those modified mufflers on his nova  you could hear him a block away  youll need a new target sheet  oh oh no no no  this is uh this is fine  theyre so much lighter when theyre filled with water  you missed  did i really  look at that  its a perfect match  damn  im telling you  theres no way katarinas going to talk to you  yeah well i sort of lied about that part  were not here to see katarina  who we were to see  this is highly inappropriate mr spencer  the investigation is over  what if they got the wrong man  and who would the right man be  you  mr mccallum i didnt have anything to do with this  i killed my own son  if it makes you feel any better i dont think you meant to  youre not a detective  youre not even a cop  youre right  im a psychic  and i saw the whole thing  i see a ransom drop  youre doing everything they ask  you didnt call the police  youre thinking of nothing but the security of your son  after all whats 5 million to you  youre driving away  i can see it  something strange happens  you recognize the car  you pass it on the hill  its malcolm orsos  youve seen it hundreds of times at your house ever since high school  maybe it confirms a suspicion that you already have  you know where they are  you know the cabin  hes making coffee  you didnt mean to kill him did you  no

said you didnt get it until you were 18  he said that  that is just like him  the man simply refuses to acknowledge my abilities my gifts  can we discuss my fee  theres a check in the cage  sign for it and then come back in  comecome back in here  why  you familiar with a chop shop in summerland  dad  so are you gonna continue with this little charade  well it sort of gives me carte blanche you

it  i dont expect you to be dad  awesome  psych  as in got you   or as in psychic   you named your fake detective agency psych  why dont you just call it  hey were fooling you and the police department  hope we dont make a mistake and someone dies because of it   first of all gus that name is entirely too long  it would never fit on the window  and secondly the best way to convince people  youre not lying to them is to tell them you are  whatever shawn  its your agency  go for it  actually its our agency  i put your name on the lease as well  tell me does that look anything like your signature  i gave it a shot  this better be a joke  dont worry  you wont have to do a thing  i have worked out every last detail  whats your dental plan  dont get cavities  health plan  same with hepatitis and shingles  so im supposed to quit my job  skip over and do this for no guaranteed money  no guaranteed money  but all guaranteed fun  no no more cases shawn  it was fun for a few days  well its gonna have to be fun for a minimum of six months  or well have to pay a lease penalty  which would be a blemish on your  otherwise very impressive credit report  you solved one mystery and now you renting office space  gus ive solved a bunch of mysteries  for instance the mystery of who kept stealing your newspaper  answer me  the mystery of what were doing this weekend  hint it involves dragsters  and finally the mystery that is the case the chief just brought me in on  you got another case already  a car thief got poisoned by his boss  he used something over the counter
