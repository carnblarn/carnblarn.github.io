totally lame  i just said that because i was flustered  i raise carrier pigeons  im glad you said that  because i was afraid to tell you how cool  i thought carrier pigeons are  flying around and  carrying stuff  coming back  awesome  i hear that  are you familiar with the exclusivity clause in your contract  it means we dont allow second jobs  jobs  no no  psych is more like community service  and it never affects my work  well  this photo was taken thursday night  i notice that you signed out early that day  i think the important thing is i signed out  lets roll back the clock shall we  monday the 28th  you had three appointments you missed all of them  tuesday the 29th  you disappeared after lunch  and wednesday  well here you are  you did your entire weeks work in one afternoon  it

choice   i know you know    that im not telling the truth    i know you know    they just dont have any proof    embrace the deception    learn how to bend    your worst inhibitions    tend to psych

in the last four cases youve worked  thank you  that wasnt a compliment  im just trying to keep the streets safe chief  the last incident was at a cat show  well let me just go on record as saying that  i would never shoot a cat  i guess i could find some solace in that  unless it was approaching in a threatening manner  or refused to stop upon my command  i would probably just fire a warning shot  to make my point but its really a field decisin  i cant commit to it at this juncture  ive requested a departmentsanctioned psychologist to come here and have  a sessin or two with you  im just gonna have to say no  that wasnt a question  could you phrase it like one  hey katie cathy shawn  shawn  what the hell are you doing here  i should ask you the same question  i work here  okay i

hear some good news  i have worked out a compromise that will solve all of this   really  yes  you quit this job this job you quit  we take on extra cases to make up the difference in salary  i make

going to sit down now  lots of talk about this in the office  yes sir im aware of that and ive already taken care of it  i dont think you have  when my wife and i moved into our house  we were met with a series of unexplained disturbances  perhaps fueled by my wifes predilection for the supernatural  well after a while it stopped but recently  these occurrences have returned to the point where my wife  is staying with her mother  mr haversham why are you telling me this  because i believe my wife believes our house is haunted  and i would like to hire you  gus i  had a strange feeling i was need  cool eh  looks like word getting out about you moonlighting  isnt the worst thing in the worid  lets be clear haversham is the most powerful man in this office  hes gonna be running this company sometime soon   give the man the respect he deserves  what is this   his company bio learn it  bred for success  his father is william haversham genius entrepreneur  this guy grew up under the tutelage of a business master   and real estate magnate  i know him   hes the one that built the poliodome  polodome  thats a much less depressing name shouldnt we go  no meet me at havershams at 700

some sort of recording device  no i dont record my sessions i prefer just to talk  how do you rember the important things  youve heard of a photographic memory  well i have a bit of i guess youd call it  an eidetic tonal memory  so youll remember everything ive said  pretty much yes   would you like to start  yes first question   wheres the bug  the what  the bug  nothing new in this area   must be concealed on your person  i honestly dont have anything on me  then you wouldnt be opposed to me patting you down  actually im very opposed to that  would you be willing to submit to a polygraph

do  what innocently flip   through a photo album  no youre sabotaging this on purpose   why would i do that  to get me fired  so i have no other choice but to go back psych  thats actually an ingenious plan  but thats not how i play gus  i play fair and i roll hard  im gonna find this mans ghost and i will rid him of it  did haversham have any enemies  not really corporate thinks hes a magician  he completely revamped our inventory system  really  whole system from a to z  including m  all the vowels  this guy sounds like a real maverick  mr haversham allow me to say  this is my

office in hopes of haunting your regional sales manager  uh ogletree  unfortunately he doesnt believe in ghosts  so i had to go a little higher on the rung  luckily for me  katie from accounts receivable gave me a little tip  about havershams wife  finally got to use my air conditioner and heating guy disguise  i had an ultrasonic beeper in my pocket for the dog  i actually thought you caught that one for a second  and dude hear me  hadewych  dont ever ever put dry ice in your mouth  it doesnt matter how well you wrap it up  okay what about the old woman  young woman  she does shakespeare in the parking lot  down at the albertsons by la cumbre plaza  she was all stoked to finally have a paying gig  oh and ditching the dress in the woods  well that was just an improv  because who knew fearless guster would come after her  you badass  the rest of it was pretty simple really  i even visited alice bundy in prison  to get a few pointers  how do we solve it   solve what  the ghost  how do we solve a case where youre the culprit  that is a very good question  i hadnt thought that far ahead  you havent thought that far ahead  well give me a second  i  im hiding under the towel  and then i realize the towels my life  and and the pool is third grade  and the high dive is my father  i  i poured out to you secrets even i didnt know i had  that wasamazing  i mean its

someone here who works for the department occasionally  actually hes my son  really  oh you know i know pretty much everybody  who comes through the department  whats his name  shawn spencer   ghostgone  just like that   just like that  its split its history  will not be bothering you again and that is a guarantee   how can youguarantee  please dont ask just enjoy  and now regarding our fee  of course there will be no charge  knowing that you appreciate the work  that gus does for the community  and for the company  its more than enough reward  but if you were to insist on some sort of expense reimbursement  we of course would not accept  please have a seat  i have a bit of the sixth sense myself mr guster  helps me out when a business deals about to go south  and its bothering me right now  i dont understand thisguarantee  and i dont like it  last night when that call came in  guster you went upstairs  at the end of that call i heard something  that made me question all of this  what was it  it was the voice  something was wrong with it  what was wrong with it  it said  gus  gus  just like that  well sir uh  im pretty sure that that can be easily explained  yes im sure that it can  but theres something i really need for you to do for me right now  yes  leave  and mr guster i will carefully ponder  my next move and your future with the company  lets talk burton  well thank you for your time mr haversham  imsorry you dont believe me  but i do understand  can we speak privately  just one second  whats your game  i have two games  red rover and lawn darts  wed need at least four for even the most  rudimentary game of rover  and they dont make lawn darts anymore  too dangerous but thats not why im here  i sensed several things in that house that  i couldnt tell you with other people in the room  this is getting desperate mr spencer  but please wow me  you werent raised by your father  you were raised by your grandmother  it was her ring  her ring that your wife  wears now  okay  perhaps my father wasnt as present as id hoped  and yes my wife wears my grandmothers ring  that doesnt mean anything  maybe not to you  but the sanctity of marriage means a lot to your grandmother  and having an affair with what  a secretary  that just feels wrong  no matter how good her pappardelle is  and just what the hell are you accusing me of  youre getting hot chocolate on the floor  is this biancas pappardelle  i hear voices  lady voices in the house  no accusations here  im just telling you your grandmother is very disappointed in you  and she doesnt want you to go to jail  well nothing youve accused me of is illegal  he completely revamped our inventory system  repackaging samples and reselling them  while lucrative is highly illegal  so what is this now   a shakedown  no theres no shakedown  im just telling you what i know  im a psychic  and with great power comes great responsibility  and that responsibility i share with gus  all we want  is the opportunity to continue doing our work  just between us  im a psychic  i cant lie  okay  mr guster back to work  as per our conversation your raise will be reflected in your next check  uh im sorry im confused  spend a little more time on your own business frankjim  excuse me  i know about you too  his hair is horrible  she who bore me  what are you doing here goose  oh i finished working on my case  and i had this amazing idea that i would come by  and scoop you up and take you to a movie and it would just be us  actually your dad was planning on coming by  of course he was   okay ill go  waitenough   what happened  when  between you two  mom that is a veritable lifetime of conversations  follow me no mom  mo come on  my god   sit  are we really gonna do this   sit down  okay  what happened dont mince words  with dad  mom we were both there you know  we dont need to revisit the past  maybe we do  well im not sure i wanna forgive him for what happened  the divorce  it wasnt what happened mom  it was the way that it happened  i mean lets call it  what it was  he left us  he left you  he ended up with the house  and he left you  by yourself  to pick up the pieces  thats not exactly what i call hero material you know  shawn  i left him  come on mom you dont  you dont have to spin this for me okay  let me be clear  your father was wonderful to me  he wanted to keep going to counseling  he kept saying we could make it but  the writing was on the wall a long time  youre losing me here mom what are you  when i got that job out of town  it was an incredible opportunity  i was afraid i would never have a chance again so i took it  you were into your senior year  your your path was set  it seemed the right time if such a thing is possible  i thought of all people that you would be okay  and i am so sorry  mom you dont ever you dont ever have to be sorry  about anything  dont you spin this  sometimes i get the worst realizations  i know  i know  that i failed you  buti think  that day my life began again  and that sounds terrible but dont you ever think i wanted to leave you
