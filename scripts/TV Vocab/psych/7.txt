secretary  from a temp agencyit takes real foresight   and creativity to get one from a modeling agency  a modeling agency   now why would a beautiful lady like that  want to be our secretary   oh

thought  i think we should take the rest of the day off  what say you   all weve done is eat a box   of animal cookies and crash a crime scene  the case with the doctor  theyre coming back to us eventuallyyou know this  so lets go to the beach  its too nice a day for murder and mayhem  i have to see them right nownein  nein   its important  im sorry i dont mean to barge in but  i need help

spirits ever   speak to you   no nowhatever  whoever it is  it hasnt spoken to me  oh  have you contacted the police   yeahbut they said  there was nothing they could do  so here i am  robert   we deal with this kind of phenomenon  all the time  and what you need to realize  is that evicting a spirit  is a very timeconsuming  and absurdly expensive process  i dont care okay   i just cant go on living this way  excuse me  oh really   yes   yes shawn  all im saying is that  it might be easier to try moving into  a different houseone thats less  haunted  i tried that  whatever this thing isit followed me   all the way from san francisco  maybe it likes you  no i dont think so  what makes you say that   i think it tried to kill me  gus what is all this   gear we might need  if were going to be hunting for spirits  we might as well do it right  methodicallysystematically  scientificallywho knows  we might be surprised what we find  video camera nice  audio recordermotion detectors  gus i

explanation  no no no shawn  it wasnt on tv and it wasnt a radio  it was coming from the walls  and the voice  the voice told me  that our house was built  on an old indian burial ground  shut up  she said  she said she was sad  because she had died many moons ago  and was trapped between worlds  when i asked her her name shawn  she said  my name  my name is wilting flower  i died without knowing love  will you be my friend   how how did you know that   i never told it to anyone before   i was wilting flower  gus   i cant believe that you fell for that   i put an old walkietalkie  in the wall

werent here i  why is it doing this to me   why is it trying to kill me   okay okay  robert hey hey hey  hey bobbylook at me  now who here  has communicated with more  dispossessed souls you or me   you   thats correct  now i am telling you that this this fire  was not an attempt on your life  it wasnt no  this was a sad and desperate cry for help  from a very frightenedvery lonely apparition  are you sure about this   absolutely  of courseits also possible  that someone simply left a candle burning  i dont burn candles  gus did you burn a candle   why would i do that   cry for help it is  no one came in while we were sleeping  i checked the doors and the windows  they were all locked  from the inside  why are you looking at me like that   thats all you did   check the doors and the windows   yeah why   where did that come from   dont look at me  im not wearing lipstick  this is the only post office box  listed for regina kane  according to dr blinns calendar  she was his last appointment  she might have seen something  i want to find her  well if this is where she picks up her mail  she probably lives close by  canvass the neighborhood  see if anyone knows her  thats a really smart approach  what  thatthat shocks you   i meant that as a compliment  really   yeah  well thanks a lot  was that sarcastic   no  oh   okay  youre welcome  you still think its the exgirlfriend   a woman scorned   is a woman with motive  we need to talk to this woman  youre on your own  im tied up with work for the rest of the week  gus thats so lame  ooh  pull over  good morning detectives   collecting donations for the policemans ball   we dont have balls  i honestly have no response to that  need i remind you mr spencer  what happens when you interfere  with a police investigation   uh the case gets solved   wait a minute   you guys are working on   that murder thingyright   i completely forgot about that  hows that going   silly question  well let you get back to your investigating  bye juliet  okay where to next   listen we change our clothes  we get some lunch  and i have to get back to work  gus the plot is thickening  shawn ive already missed two days this week  oh fine fine fine  i respect your wishes  thank you jerk chicken   you know thats right  oh boy  there he is   what time is it   daytime  what happened   i might have dropped six allergy pills  in your frosty while you were peeing  you did what   where are we   palo alto  san francisco   no but close  roberts exgirlfriend lives up here gus  and we really need to talk to her  i will kill youshawn  and then youre going to  buy me some new tires  oh come on this is fun  road trip  kidnapping  thats exactly what this is  thats itwere not talking  what seriously   so were really not talking now   come onhow mature is this   the silent treatment is not how conflict  gets resolved gus  we need to work through this  we need to share our feelings  maybe a smoothie  yes   never mind  its not her  pardon me  what do i meanits not her   lips  lips dont match  lips that kissed your forehead  do not belong to amy kessler  therefore shes not our ghost  you didnt drive all the way out here  so you could sayits not herand leave   were talking to hep  her  carlton  separation means apart  whatcha got there   nothing  are you okay   of course im okay  you look sad  i am sad  why are you sad   im sad because i dont have my forensics report on my dead doctor  or a lead on my possible witness regina kane  what about that psychic guy   isnt shawn great at this sort of thing   finding people   maybe we should bring him in  maybe you should just keep your ideas to yourself  thats a joke right   yes  yes it is  okay  very nice  exquisite brush strokes  its a print  im referring of course to the original  im sorry  whats the name of your gallery again   thats been a bit of a problem actually  we wanted to call it  le petit louvre  but apparently  the art snobs in france think they have a monopoly on all things louvre  we also tried louvre ii  louvre junior  night gallery  nothing cleared  the important thing is  we want to show the amazing work of robert dunn  and he listed you as a character reference  we are very select with the clients that we take on  isnt that right francois   i have to admit  im surprised robert would list me as a character reference  we dated for a period  and it didnt end well  can i ask why   not to pry  but he did list you as a reference  the usual  forgetting dates  standing me up  sometimes hed get so wrapped up in his work  hed disappear for days at a time  the worst was when he cheated on me and lied about it  you must have been burning with furious anger  it was just so stupid  a girlfriend of mine saw him in a club with another woman  he was drunk and pretended that she had him confused with someone else  he said his name was  get this  martin brody  martin brody   roy scheiders character from jaws   yes  howd you know   well ive seen jaws  its his favorite movie  anyway when i asked him about it  he pretended hed never even heard of the club  thats uh  horrible  you must have wanted to kill him  but  probably not so much anymore  youre pretty happily engaged arent you   yes  isnt the ring great   okay so shes not our ghost  even the longest journeys can start with a tiny misstep  overall it was still a very good day  how was it a good day   oh come on gus  first of all road trip  always fun  we got some freshbaked sourdough  very nice  and the agencys sending us a new secretary tomorrow  and yes  she speaks english fluently  shawn we talked about this  we cant afford a receptionist  i dont think we can afford not to have one  gus  what   i think maybe we should move  come on gus   get in gear   go go go   the guys like a whippet  tell me about it  whats the supersmeller say   somebody had too much to drink  what are you so happy for   we almost got killed  this was not an accident  whoever that is was waiting for us  and we have a new suspect for roberts ghost  he didnt answer his phone  maybe hes not home  robert   or maybe  whoever tried to kill us last night also paid robert a visit  and left the door unlocked  anybody home   robert   bob   shawn you might want to see this  save meim trapped  i dont want to jump to conclusions here  but this very well may be a cry for help  maybe someone died here  or was buried alive  this could be the cry of a tortured soul  so this guy just happens to move into two haunted houses in a row   dont touch that  its blood  its not blood  enjoy your hepatitis  and this tortured soul might be less tortured with a latex enamel  he wouldnt get these messy drips  now what   ive got itive got it  ive got it  hallelujah   what   youve got to see this  not what i was expecting  okay  i know what im looking at but  what does it mean   is it a ghost   no buddy  its not a ghost  is there a woman living up here   that would certainly explain  the perfume roberts been smelling  and all the red hair laying everywhere  but no no dice  then what is it   come on gus  look  what   robert is a woman  no hes not  not all the time  but sometimes  no  doesnt seem like the type  hes not the type  then how   unless he has that personality thing  what personality thing   oh you know what im talking about  the multiple personality disease  you know that  whatshername had  the flying nun  in the other thing the tv movie  smokey and the bandit   yeah dude  smokey and the bandit  yes  what does that have to do with  multiple personalities   you asked  i asked a real question  give me a real answer not a random guess  okay fine  hooper  hooper   hooper  hooper was a stunt man  i dont think sally field was even in hooper  who are you thinking of   you know  terry bradshaw  yes  is it norma rae   no  but that would have made that movie a lot cooler  the thing youre asking about shawn  is referred to as dissociative identity disorder  thats it   thats what robert has gus  it all makes sense  do you know how rare that is   im not saying all of santa barbara has it  just robert one guy  i think that qualifies as pretty rare  i dont know shawn  these are huge  look  think about it  two separate but distinct personalities one body  ones a man  the others a woman  the female personality cooks dinner  robert thinks the meals are the work of a ghost  the female rearranges the furniture  robert thinks  the ghost is moving things when hes not around  his old girlfriend did say that he would disappear for stretches at a time  which would explain  when the female personality was in control  robert would disappear  and he would have no clue about any of it  now all we need to figure out is  how to bring out the woman  so that we can talk to her  okay  okay okay okay  triggers  shoot him   then what   no no  sights sounds smells  something that would trigger the personality to come out  triggers it is  gus this is  this is going to be kind of cool  or weird  where did all this stuff come from   is this where she lives   thethe  the angry female spirit that you sensed   yes  i feel her very strongly here robert  do you   do you feel  pretty   what   do you feel pretty   he  he means do you feel a female presence   no  but im not psychic  do you think that you can  communicate with her   im trying  i am  im sorry  okay  you guys are starting to creep me out  so if im not needed  i think ill go back downstairs  okay  let me just put this away  well all go down together  you coming shawn   yes  robert  these are some terrific clothes  i bet they look absolutely beautiful on you  regina  regina who  who are you talking to   yes  yes gus  why dont you tell  regina  how much you like her nice clothes   yeah regina  regina  you look beautiful  regina  regina  thank you gus  i cant tell you how glad i am that you got my message  so  do you think that you can help me   please   dude  this isnt right  i must look horrible  no not at all  you are too kind but  then again i already knew that  the way you comforted robert  you were so sweet  unlike most men  afraid to show their emotions  ive been hurt a lot  now if you two dont mind  i really must put on my face  so regina  this message on the wall  this was your way of trying to get roberts attention   he doesnt even know im alive  why not write him a letter  or an email  or even a postit even   i tried  i really did try  but every time  something or someone stopped you  what are you talking about   i think theres another personality  regina  theres another personality isnt there   i mean you dont smash pictures or start fires  you would never strangle robert  no i wouldnt  regina the police would like to speak with you  theyre investigating drblinns murder  they think you might have seen something  you could be in danger  i didnt see anything  i didnt even go to my appointment  why would anyone want to hurt drblinn   he was such a nice man  and he was doing so much to help me  with what   you ought to know better than to ask that  thats between a woman and her doctor  okay  unless youre going to ask her out  i think were done here  how do we get robert back   i have no idea  youre her very special friend  regina   we would like to speak with robert  can you let robert come out and play   for you   of course i can  thank you  and i do hope that we meet again  robert   robert   robert   try bob  easy easy easy easy easy  we know it seems weird  and and  and actually it is  its really weird  but we have good news  we figured out who your ghost is  who   you  youre haunting yourself  life is good  life is great  robert gets the help he so desperately needs  and we get to marinate in the delicious satisfaction of another job well done  leading lassiter to regina  even though she saw nothing   thats professional courtesy  plus it helps raise our stock gus  crime scene photos   love crime scene photos  may i help you   detective ohara  what a truly pleasant surprise  i just dropped by to tell detectivelassiter that i have  we  have information regarding the whereabouts of a one regina kane  how did you know about  never mind  stay right here  dont move  ill go find him  shawn   shawn dont do this  gus look at this   look look look   what  here  on the floor  where poor drblinns body was laying  a toothpick  a chewed toothpick  so   dont you remember   the car that tried to rammed us  on the seat   chewed toothpick  that means  the person that killed drblinn is the same person that tried to kill us  its a chewed toothpick shawn  lots of people chew toothpicks  yes but we were working for robert  robert is also regina  regina is a patient of  drblinn  yes take the baton   so whoever the killer is knew both robert and regina  he said his name was  get this  martin brody  how dumb is that   martin brody  of course  thats roberts other personality  the violent one  but why would he kill drblinn   that depends entirely on what regina was seeing him for  youve got to be kidding me  what   drblinns patient files  all we have to do is find reginas  what are you doing   what are you doing   shooting  it relaxes me  shawn spencer says he has information for you  where is he   at your desk  is anyone watching him   found it  no  what   gender reassignment   reginas tired of feeling like a woman trapped in a mans body  so she wants to have her parts  my g  wait a second  that means if regina was successful  both robert and the martin personality would also lose their parts  but martin cant do anything to hurt regina  because hed only be hurting himself  so  dressed as regina  he goes after drblinn  that would explain how robert got the marks on his neck  and with drblinn dead  robert figured that regina would change her mind about the gender reassignment  right   we got that   only she hasnt  gus  no no  she found another doctor  shes seeing him  today  when   right now  right now shawn   like in 10 minutes  okay  there had better be a really good explanation for this  he was in some sort of trance  i couldnt control him  he says this is the killer  kill    hes going to kill again  this is ridiculous  who   whos he going to kill   what is it shawn   watch out  watch out     drdrake   gender reassignment   thats a big step regina  why dont you tell me why its important to you  its okay  the machine can get that  this is your time  thank you drdrake  no answer  its just the machine  we have to go now  it could already be too late  lets go  i know this can be a difficult process  but it really is necessary to ensure that  youre ready psychologically for a change like this  you do seem like an excellent candidate for surgery  our time is up  why dont we pick up here again next week okay regina   okeydokey  only  my name is not regina  hold it   get up   whats going on   robert   bob   you back there buddy   what am i doing here   great  thanks  good news  theyre going to admit robert into the htwindsor facility in chicago  and his doctor thinks his prognosis is good  dont you understand shawn   thats the premier mental health  hospital in the country  yeah thats goodthats awesome  who is that   leslie  no  no no no no  leslie is supposed to be a swimsuit model  unfortunately  he is  although he says hes getting completely sick of the grind  i have to call the agency  theyre completely misrepresenting their clientele  leslies a guys name too  okay  we have to fire him  fire him   on what grounds   what grounds   on the grounds that hes a dude  thats discrimination  we cant do that  okay listen to me  no woman is going to look at us twice  if were sharing our office with that ridiculous adonis  hes betterlooking than both of us put together  yeah  im not doing it  gus  you know i cant fire people  they look too sad  this was your idea  figure it out
