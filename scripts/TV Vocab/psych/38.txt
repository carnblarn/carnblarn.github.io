detective carlton lass  would you just play the tape  thats a lariat move  these guys are exmilitary no question  and that one there is calling the shots  so there appears to be a pattern here  well detectives  when you know something you could find me in my office  hey chief  all right we definitely need to check out  all the local paramilitary groups the security contractors rotc  santa barbara ladies auxiliary  oh theyre women  it cant be women  this kind of thing took some kind of muscle  its a little shocking isnt it  not as shocking as this  these are 31s and theyre really pulling through here  make yourself useful get me the 32s  i dont have time for this either you have something or you dont  got it lets go see the chief   you got it  lets just say ive got suspects  good lets go and give them the names  i got studying to do how many suspects are we talking  eh give or take   really mr spencer  it wouldnt be possible perhaps to narrow it down just a bit would it  not without help its a tight group chief  its a clique  its a sisterhood of the yaya variety  and its gonna take a lot more than a smile  and a pack of pall malls to get em to talk  not a problem toughtocrack suspects are right in my wheel house  negative we cannot go about this  using a typical lassitarian technique  we need someone  on the inside  are you saying you want to go undercover  undercover yes me no  unfortunately im not qualified for this sort of thing  dont worry about it  ive been itching to do some undercover work and  ive got a new moustache guy  i like where your heads at  because this is going to take a very specific skill set  there is only one person in this room  that can pull it off  ive just got one question  can you skate  and its looking like were in for an  an excruciating jam as maniac  cuts through the pack like a machete  that defense had better get on the defensive or else  ooh look out below  psych 3x07 talk derby to me    berman auditorium is about to become  the garden of beatin  and its miss anthropy around the outside  dont let her through  pick her up  pick her up somebody pick her up  i couldnt have called a better assignment  yeah right youre a rocket scientist  i thought the police had a suspect from the roller derby like a month ago   seven seven  seven deadly cinderella  yeah but it didnt go anywhere  what did you find that got chief vick back onto this roller derby angle  oh just everything  damage the hand signals  the scuff marks on the floor were caused by  competition skate wheels  vick wouldnt buy it until i threw in some roller babble  think about it who better for a smash and grab job  than an organized team  you think they were all on wheels  at least one of them was  what makes you so sure it was one of these teams  you want to take this one  what  check the schedule these were the only two teams who were off  on all the nights the breakins occurred  we call that detective work its a rare and beautiful thing  like clubbed thumbs  i dont know how were gonna solve this case these women scare me  are you kidding its a cake assignment  i used to do some security work for the roller derby back in the day  those broads they knew how to get the job done  this is i dont know this is like a fashion show   these broads they dont hit  thats why we brought you down here  to hear you say broads repeatedly  why dont you explain to us how all this works  do you see the one with the star on her helmet  shes the lead jammer she scores points  when she passes the opposing skaters  all right look at her right there the one they call fox  shes reaching down shes up to something  see that piece of tape  number 13 shes been marked  shes gonna get hit shes gonna be taken down  watch this watch it here it goes  oh and theres another one for the suicide seats  its happy times for westwood wilde  and captain denise kamikaze fox  this is our only chance to snoop around gus  lets go   dad you all right  hit her  no hit her now shes down  hes fine  would you  hit  what are we doing shawn  well for starters were both growing moustaches  very very slowly but were also investigating  this is juliets investigation were gonna blow her cover   we need to stay out of her way  youre exactly right gus  or we do the exact opposite i vote for number two  be my lookout  no theres only a few minutes left shawn and you want to go inside  worst lookout ever  you didnt see the girl walk in  and i round this corner and theres maniac  and im like whered she go  and shes like whered who go she moves pretty good for fresh meat  thats totally a compliment whered you learn to skate like that  oh you know college rollerskate team  and xanadu  thats funny i get it  dude you are leering  and if by leering you mean staring oddly  in a creepy way yes but its for an investigation gus  theyre all scraped up from burglarizing  burglarization burglarism  of course theyre scraped up its a full contact sport  since when do we get injuries underneath our elbow pads  and thats a glass cut on the other one check it out  thats leering   shawn what are you guys doing here  im moving on this case  im pretty sure i found the extra sensory vortex in this building   where  womens locker room  which is a place ive always wanted to hang out   so its totally a winwin  i get this is how you work  but this is not how we are going to be doing things  i am lead detective and this is first and foremost a police investigation  so if we are going to be partners we are going to be doing things my way  all kidding aside i got some serious vibes in there  and possibly athletes foot  great ill check it out and come by your office later  but right now i need you guys to get out of here  is this guy bothering you maniac  wilde fox this is   this is  i know who this guy is  we see gawkers like him all the time around here  really easy to spot  theres always one thing off about them  clothes hair  teeth  you just named my three best features  fourth on the list posture  fifth elocution  maniacmaniac19 president protem  maniac fan club  this is my vice president longbranch pennywhistle  im just looking to score a little face time with the maniac  you know for the blog   nothing i cant handle  i was just about to give em an interview  it was only gonna be two words  okay come on  ill see you tonight bring the outfit  one of us might wear it  get lost  might i have a word in my office  oh sorry chief i have to break these things in  and you know how my family is cursed with bad arches right  please take them off  i was just gonna suggest that  later  did you break somebodys nose  yes i did thank you  oh but it was a clean hit  it was actually more of a dislocation you know it just popped right back in  yeah she curled into my wingspan so i was totally justified  were friends now she has a cat  im concerned for your safety and that this might be a mistake  no no no it is not a mistake  its actually a very smart call  i have found a scad of priors on my suspects  aggravated assault battery  oh and reckless endangerment  so youre saying putting you in danger is a bonus  im telling you i can handle myself  i didnt want to do this in the first place  and ill be candid ohara  you tend to dive in a little too deeply when you go undercover  look chief first off  roller derby is better than therapy  if i were into that sort of thing  and secondly these girls theyre not making any money  most of them are paying out of pocket  they are all the right element for this kind of behavior  hunches and profiles are not gonna keep this thing going  i need concrete proof  soon  i want every single one of those suspects from that security video  done  this a typo right  800 for skates  would it help if i told you the other pairs werent cute at all  get me results hurry  this is maniac  tonight  yeah i can keep it quiet  okay  ill be there  im sorry im late  oh my god  is there somebody here are you on a date  i didnt know if youd be hungry i threw something together quickly  we gotta get right to this i was just at the station   i really think i am on to something  thats great  we have all night to talk about it   gewurztraminer  yes no  i cant stay i got a call from one of the girls   are those crab cakes  yes they are  with dill and coriander   which girl are we talking about  they call her  toxic waste but her name is shelly  said she was talking to some of the other girls and that they were very  impressed by me i am perfect for something  they have going on downtown tonight a moneymaking opportunity  dont go  i ran some of their names   they have records  ive already eliminated toxic waste   she wasnt at the breakin  i dont think you understand  i am undercover right now things can get real sticky real fast  sticky how  listen this thing thats happening tonight  its not what you think it is  now sit down have some endives  are we working together or not  technically were working together on this case but you know what   im not feeling together right now  then support me  because i really think i am on to something  i gotta go and youre either in or youre out  north exit south exit nobody gets out  you do realize were outside of a warehouse  thats not the point even if its not a burglary  its likely some kind of criminal activity  this place isnt like any of the others  i am really sorry i have to do this to you but  spencer youre in the way  go  were gonna let her get in here  and on her signal  were gonna light this candle   brilliant beautiful  stand down  do it again reset the playback please  a music video shoot  i sent nearly a dozen uniformed officers and six black and whites  and none of your suspects were even there  im gonna need a pretty damn compelling reason not to pull the plug on this one  because right now weve got nothing  it was me  i felt a vibe i got a message  you did  yes  turns out it was a major metaphysical snafu  ohara said it was a nonstart  i threw a tantrum i was crying  kicking and stamping my little feet  theyre not abnormally small  chief i can get results let me in on this  sure chief lassie seems like a smart choice  we know hes a demon on wheels and hes so very good with women  under the circumstances i might consider you  but youre never more obvious than when youre undercover  perhaps youve forgotten the prosthetic nose debacle of 2005  chief we are definitely onto something  last nights robbery fits the pattern weve seen between criminal activity  and specific teams weve narrowed it down to a few suspects  three suspects teammates friends pen pals  solid suspects  maybe four  possibly five   six could  the idea is to have fewer  suspects you dont get paid by the suspect  i see us closing this by tomorrow   tomorrow then  absolutely  fine  but im gonna need results without another incident metaphysical  or otherwise  youre all dismissed  she really unloaded on us  thank you for taking the heat on that one  thats how it goes when youre partners  if i could count the number of times that gus has left my cheese in the wind   what  nothing study on buddy  arteriosclerosis rosacea croup   croup  youll have to owe me one  or you can give me one of these bracelets  they come in teal   cant do  cant do teal  westwood gave it to me  a roller derby thing think of something else  you can dial back the maniac routine stop pulling rank on me   ordering me around  fine  and smoothies are on you until we nab someone  i want to figure out the next step by seeing how you work  i want to get close to your process get some hard evidence  yeah thats a good idea  why dont you bring her right in on your process  heres the thing close is good  very close is even better  but not for this  my process is not a tandem bike its a unicycle  you belong at practice  i can see fox   you gotta keep an eye on her  thats gonna be difficult  shes always surrounded by westwood and wilde  perfect keep an eye on them too  there  the lists from vicks desk  they make absolutely no sense whatsoever  why dont you arrange them in alphabetical order  thats not the point they stole a dvd of spanglish   they werent after the merchandise  thats not exactly hard evidence   thank you professor no help  what  im sorry did you miss that maybe i shouldve said mc no help  or doctor donothing because youre bringing nothing to the table  i have a test remember  no pass no job  no job no driving you around  besides youre doing perfectly fine with your new partner   who jules  who jules  who do you think   dont be jealous  im not  dont be vexed youre still number one on my myspace page  jules and i are just working a case together nothing more  what is this green slime on your book you come from the kids choice awards  this place is filthy   wilde was there  what  cynthia speed freak wilde  was there at zilks during the breakin  she uses this green oil to lubricate her skates  looks like she left some behind  good clue buddy  you have fox with the broken watch and now wilde why dont you call the cops  according to the tapes there were at least three more  if we dont get them theyre gonna doing their thing that  is the oath of thieves  that is the code of the roller girl  i never thought i would hear you say that  even more than sinkhole sissy feet flapjack gogo boots  juliet isnt answering her phone  you know those crab cakes are like three days old or something  okay remember maniac the key is to just get through the pack   whatever it takes  we dont want to injure anyone   in practice do we  of course not  if someones shoulder has to get dislocated  make sure it isnt yours  back to it boss   wait where is lethal weapon  oh westwood  she had to split a second ago go visit her mother   lets go kick some ass  cool   im just gonna grab something  okay see you on the track   you leaving  yeah   everything okay  i have to go meet my boyfriend  hes kinda got car trouble so  i have to go  hes kind of stranded out on the mesa somewhere  okay all right make sure you bring him to the bout tomorrow  yeah ill try  see ya later  i found a couple of handheld scanning machines here at the hall  you feel anything on scanning machines  scanning machines  for making copies  copying devices are notoriously unreliable psychic fetters  now if they were threehole punchers different story  im gonna look around some more but i wanted to let you know  westwood left practice early today  she gave me some lie and then she just took off  im getting something now street clothes green tank top jeans belt  terrible terrible belt   do you see her  en mi cabesa  i got a psychic track on her now  okay i gotta go call lassiter if you find anything out  of course ill call lassiter  im not calling lassiter  follow the bouncing westwood  not too close shes gonna see us   dude is that  what  i think theres a body in the back of that truck  its not a body  it is thats a head  this test has got you all jacked up youre not thinking straight  youre distracted trying to remember the difference between lermacil   and hermacil  lermacil is for fever blisters   hermacil is for eczema  what about chermacil  no such thing as chermacil  studying  sweet fantasy island that is a body  i told you  not too close  westwood is ditching a body thats the break in the case we need  we need is to call lassiter like juliet said and back off a little   shes gonna see us  were not calling him you know  how this works i really have to explain it to you every single time  you lost westwood  damn it  bingo   lets go  im not going out there  dude its only gonna take a second  you cannot sit here alone in the dark in a parked car   youll get picked up for mopery  mopery  with intent to creep trust me  itll kick a big hole in your future  i guess it wasnt a body  well done spencer  i dont know chief you want me to try and get her statement  of course i dont speak mannequin  cute you might want to hold off on that  because we still have all the merchandise from the zilks burglaries   excellent work  thanks chief  its all right i accept your apology  so the burglars werent

know that shawn  they were using the hand scanners to steal information  off credit card applications theyre stealing identies   was just to throw us off the trail  righto a handful of fake credit cards  is worth more than everything in that entire store times ten  its a pretty brilliant plan  only slightly less brilliant than that youtube video  of the monkey bathing the cat  we need you to come with us maniac  right now  jules who is that whos talking  we gotta go  so we have three suspects two to go  you think theyre on to juliet they might be  were gonna find out pretty quick  what do
