whats your caseload like   light  ish  good answer  because i have a special assignment that comes directly from the mayor  the mayor really  yes  theres your assignment   is he a witness or something  no hes just a delinquent  hes been pulling off some penny ante vandal stuff  taking down street signs crazy gluing parking meter slots  removing hood ornaments nothing serious yet but  ah but thats how it starts one minute theyre destroying public property  and the next thing you know theyre shooting cops   so what i need you to do is  no i know exactly  where you were going with this thing chief its like our brains are just connected on this thing  im just trying to figure out how we try this kid as an adult  i need you to dial it back about 50 notches or i will ask you to put your gun on my desk  what you are going to do is straighten him out  spend a little time with him take him on a ridealong nurture him  show him what a life of crime leads to  and he gets this special treatment because  his mothers the deputy mayor and she doesnt want the kid in the system  so just fix him  yes maam  i think all that writing gave me a ganglion cyst  you cant get a cyst from filling out paperwork  if the pen is wrong you can  theres definitely some carpal bossing in there  we should see if they have some extra thumb splints lying around  you know what we should do  we should enroll

anything else you wanna tell us mr kent   no not that i can think of  are you sure  dad what are you getting at just spit it out  shawn oswald chester disappeared from these grounds 12 times before

happen to mention to my son that during these jaunts  the community here filled out a missing persons report  only to have good old ozzie pop up the next day  guys i know what this sounds like  but ozzie did not run off on his own not this time  and you know this how  he was my best friend  i could always tell when he was getting antsy when he wanted to run  but this time there were no warning

for a marathon  those numbers are the distances he was trying to reach  and the date thats circled is the santa barbara marathon  and how do you know that  easy its the same as val kilmers birthday  we gotta figure out where he went jogging  all right shawn im gonna humor ya  lets get outta here  humor me  that was spot on  its like almond butter with honey  you only know that because you have an unhealthy  fascination with the guy fromreal genius  okay thats it youre not coming with us  i am going down to that nazi lady at the front desk  and i am having your inout privileges revoked  oh mr

its not my blood  its on a rock  dude pedometer  its exactly what a marathon runner would be carrying around with him  how far would you say we are from the community  i would say about six miles   i guess we found the place where he fell  yeah we did  now we got a bigger problem  if hes not at the community and hes not here where the hell is his body  this is the closest hospital to the drop zone  if someone came across oswalds body this is where he would be  hi there  were looking for my father oswald chester  im sorry we dont have anyone here by that name  you know what he left his i d at

back seat smells like foot  i mean seriously did something die back here  thats the smell of your future unless you straighten up and fly right  whats your story baby   excuse me  its detective ohara punk   and thats strike one  is he always like this  call me baby again youre gonna get on my bad side too  whoa what bad side all good from where im sitting  hey unless you wanna pee in front of seven other guys  for the rest of your life you will respect the badge   why dont you tell me why youre acting out  im not acting out   he started it  i was talking to the kid  did anyone tell you that your hair smells like strawberries  its peaches  i have to buy peaches on the way home i just remembered   so uh juliet  its detective ohara   strike two  you gotta lighten up man  you get to hang out with this amazingly hot woman all day long  detective oharas an officer of the law  she is a competent investigator efficient with her paperwork  and maintains her work space in a clean and orderly fashion  but she is above all things not hot  wheelchair to admitting  wheelchair to admitting  thats oswald  lets find out what happened medical students   residents  its all the same to me  hello i am dr hauser  i am filling in today  this is my personal candy striper knikknac   hello  hes from guam  we will be instructing you  lets begin you impress me  this patient is three days postop  he has an open wound which is healing nicely  knicknac get a hold of yourself  or ill put you on the first raft back to talofo  god that looks like roadkill  yeah is what his family probably thought when they came here to visit  because they love him  you know what i was  i was thinking of something more in an older guy  athletic build perhaps in a coma or a comalike state  the patient behind yous in a coma  no sh  perfect lets begin there  john doe  admitted two days ago with severe hypotension causing low brain perfusion  also suffered intracranial bleed from syncope and falling down  what the hells wrong with you  where do you get off using all those long complicated words in front of the patient  you know when i went to school where one goes to become a doctor   med school  yes  there was something called bedside manner  do they not teach that anymore  uh sir this patients unconscious he cant hear me  youre wrong  youre dead wrong he can hear you  sure his body is sleeping but inside he is dancing   he is feeling it  hes doing his thing  and he hears you say all those scary words and he retreats right back into his mind  now do you wanna help this patient or not  of course sir  then speak to me like im ten years old  he had a sudden drop in blood pressure which deprived his brain of blood  he also suffered a contusion and small cerebral hemorrhage  talk to me like im five  his blood pressure went boom   and his brain got an owie  i see   and why do we suspect foul play  we dont suspect foul play  oh really you dont find anything at all strange about his condition  well his b p didnt come up immediately when we administered fluids   and what does that tell us  he  probably took too much of his blood pressure medication by accident  sometimes the elderly have to take a lot of pills at different dosages  or they take it forget and take it again  but theres nothing criminal about that  no no theres not  well done both of you  i dont know about you but im drained what do you say we take a fiver  grab a coke maybe play some frogger  doctor we still have a lot of patients to see  five minutes isnt gonna kill them is it   is it  we did it gus  we beat my dad proved our point now lets rub it in a little  maybe make fun of his toes give jervis the good news   get the hell out of here  i hear that  im starved  thats four in a row talmadge youre on fire  you just broke the pines record  for what  number of times jumping in without breaking a hip  yeah thats funny kid hey talmy who is this  oh this is my s grandson shawn and his  hey guys meet buddy markowitz he used to be a standup in the catskills  and rodrigo lopez onetime number five clearly no longer  lightweight champion of the world  ah and thats my asian friend hoo flung poo   i dont get it  that guy wasnt even asian  well thats what makes it funny  you mind if we steal gpop here for a second  just as long as hes back in time for the cannonball competition  oh yeah  oh thank you  what are you wearing  well you didnt pack me any trunks shawn this is the only thing i could borrow  yeah well while youve been here playing at campcoon  weve been busy solving the case  we found oswal he was in the hospital  time to get you outta here  no no no no  we cant leave yet  why not this case isnt over  look this place is a hot bed of suspicious activity  hey there  heres your sandwich talmadge  well thank you meredith  thank you wheres that barbecue sauce  you know pamela really doesnt like complainers here  you know you lucky you should see the food give my mother  over at that horrible sunshine meadows place  it is one step above cat food  gee mer id feel a whole lot luckier  if the sweetest woman in the world would score me just a little teensy  eensy weensy bit of steak sauce come on   your grandfather is a flirt  you are ah  that is disgusting  you like it here  you you do that  thats why you wanna keep investigating  because you like the sandwiches and the adulation  shawn im telling you something else is going on here  dad we found oswald  theres nothing left to solve admit it  we beat you because we have the sweetness  all right clear a path folks coming through  its all right  you have the sweetness what about that guy shawn  what about that one  theyre dropping like flies   you saw the bracelets didnt you  yes i saw them  all right so we got three guys all living at the same place  they all get sick and for some reason theyre all wearing the same bracelets  what were you saying again shawn about solving this case  soemone is treint of old timers  at glorious pines  three people have gotten suddenly sick there  it could be an angel of death type thing  you know that is a brilliant theory  but what youve failed to take into account  is that its five degrees hotter today than the same day last year  frogs cant swallow with their eyes open  its true  im sorry i thought we were offering up useless pieces of information  what lassiter here means is that its not out of the ordinary for older people  to fall ill during heat waves or cold snaps  look we found oswald when you were convinced  he was just wandering around in his bathrobe  this is our client jervis kent  i mean shouldnt you call forensics in  look at wills interview beneficiaries i learned that at the police academy  you went to the academy  i thought i recognized that name  arent you the guy who set his black and white  on fire during the academy road test  yeah you shot someones toe off at the police firing range  it didnt come all the way off  i saw him yesterday   he still has a limp  spool  threads thread  im seeing thread  spinning and and bobbing and weaving  arting yet crafting  bracelets  homemade bracelets  all three of them had the same bracelet  well in that case ohara call cnn because weve got their new lead story  do the doctors whove been treating any of these patients suspect foul play  no chief  well  doublecheck  mr spencer as always its been an experience  you know where the exit is  i gotta finesse that  do you see what happens when you act like a jackass all the time  no one takes you seriously  if you do not wanna end up like that buffoon  you better learn to walk the straight and narrow  i dont like that guy  theres hope for you yet kid  and what was all that bracelet talk  i sensed a common thread pun intended  you mean the friendship bracelets those came from chelsea  she makes them herself in craft class  and she doesnt just give em to anybody  dude shes totally dancing with my dad  where did they learn the tango  grab a partner meet me on the dance floor  so you knew my friend oswald right  he courted me a little  can i get cutsies  find your own partner shawn  i dont mind talmadge  i havent had this many men ask me to dance since nixon went to china  hello  my name is shawn  im talmadges grandson  im trying to meet all of his new friends  did he happen to mention that im a psychic  psychic  really  i sensed a dark cloud  and then did you hear about what happened to harley  the paramedics and all of that stuff  of course i heard  hes an exboyfriend of mine  you dance divinely burton  thank you  my turn shawn  so youre quite the queen bee around here  you have many boyfriends here at glorious pines  ive had my share of romantic trysts  men fall in love easily when i start taking care of them  what do you mean  now spin me  maaaarvelous  they call it the florence nightingale effect  so youre a nurse  you must have done a lot of work here with different medications  well not anymore  all i do now is lead the heartsmart high blood pressure seminar once a month  thats where i met harley and oswald  save me a seat at bingo  shawn  shawn come back here  we learned that all the victims had high blood pressure  so they might have been on the same medications  i learned that old people are heavy  look my prized students believe  that ozzie got sick because he overdosed on his medication  maybe they all did  which means either three different people all accidentally   took too many pills  or someone else slipped it to them  wait wait wait a minute  i overheard a couple of the guards talking about  a breakin at the onsite pharmacy here last week  really  you wait until just now to tell us that  the thief got away with codeine and oxycontin  but i think they also got away with blood pressure medication  so that stuff was just a cover to make it look like drugseeker  the bp meds were the real target  all right at least that gives us the how now we just gotta figure out the why  which reminds me gus will you please get us those tickets for the who  where  look we need to get a list of all the people on blood pressure medication   theyre all targets  thats something pamela would have  we gotta get her outta there  the real talmadges stuff showed up this morning  hes gonna be here today  i bet shell come out if a resident hurt themselves  take a spill down the stairs   what  just take a quick header down the stairs  im not gonna deliberately hurt myself break my neck to create a distraction  fine push you itll be an accident does that make it easier  what you have to do something  my toe  hey i hurt my toe here   you stubbed your toe  dude you have to do better than that   im your father you do not call me dude  pull your weight come on  my liver my liver oh my liver it could be failing  you go from one to ten like that  how about a heart attack or a stroke  my liver  my liver   oh god it hurts  your liver is fine  youre not even jaundiced  abdominal pain can be caused by a lot of things  youre not even holding your liver thats your spleen  my spleen  its my spleen its about to rupture  now now now now mr mcgulager settle down  oh its so painful  we need to find a list of peoples medications  i think this is it  no this is the waiting list  dude oswalds getting kicked out  tomorrow  it says ftc next to his name  the other two victims as well ftc  ferocious tiger what  ftc means full time care  looks like all the victims need additional nursing assistance now  what they get kicked out for that  this place wont accept anybody that needs continuous medical care  it was all in the informational handbook  thats whats happening here  someone on the waiting list got tired of waiting  recognize any of those names  we just found our bad guy  what  what  what  what  is someone in there   take the window  whos in there  lester lester i need the key  this is darryl jablonsky  hes currently doing a nickel at the state pen   darryl  meet jj  call me hell on earth  we all thought jj would benefit in meeting you hell  see you two have a lot in common  jj here is also a tough guy  hes not afraid of the law  so what you in for  vandalism  repeated  vandalism  so why dont you take his rap sheet back to chucke cheese man  because the only thing youre gonna get in here  is curbed for a chicago smile and  im sorry  i just cant do this now  okay i think hes got the message prison is hell lets go  cant do what  i cant lie jj  part of my rehabilitation according to dr shenkman  im not supposed to be lying and things  so tell me for real  whats it like in prison  for real  it aint bad  i hang out with my best friend white slavery  most of the day  we go work out  chill in the library  we got the correctionson cd  its read by robert forster  its pretty good its tight man i enjoyed it  then we go back again we work out we eat and sleep  we chit chat  play ball  you know what i mean we do what we do man its  like good living out here man  okay but the guards are merciless  nah man theyre pretty cool man  actually were having a birthday party for one of them later on today  hey is tyrone baking the cake man  all right  i even have a job in prison man  telemarketer man  best seller of this month  believe that  bam  its all right in here man  dont worry about a thing  youre gonna have a blast man  okay this is absolutely pointless  lets go come on  thanks for nothing darryl  by the way you can kiss that recommendation at your next parole board hearing sayonara  thats cool  i hear were getting a frappucino machine next month  so what goes 10   bo derek getting old  hey  is this thing on  there is a malicious force at work in glorious pines  the recent rash of illnesses here  not an accident  what the hells going on here  hes a psychic  maybe hes having an episode  yes and i can feel that the culprit is right here in this room and its you  me  well i cant lie  ive killed on stage  no no no  not you  her  who me  no not you  her  her  meredith cloverfield  what  a name is coming to my brain  help me help me help me help me help me help me help me rhonda  rhonda cloverfield  your dear old mother at sunshine meadows  seventh on the waiting list to get into the pines  but you couldnt stand watching her rot away at that hell hole  cause theres no sunshine and theres no meadows  you love her  so you tried to bump her up that waitlist  the first thing you did break into the pharmacy  snatch yourself some blood pressure medication  and then you targeted the people that were already taking those pills  whose food you served  chelseas bracelets practically marked em for you  first up oswald chester  you knew he carbed up before a run  it was the perfect opportunity to make him overdose  this is outrageous   i couldnt hurt a fly  but you could  but she did  almost kill two other members of this community  a couple more people  and you and your mother would have been reunited and it would have felt  so good  talmadge mcgulager our covers blown  wrap it up shawn quick  check her pockets for pills  i think shes got some on her right now  how dare you  do you have a prescription for these  everyone here in the room with high blood pressure your food may be poisoned  thats right spit it out  get some baggies cause this stuff is evidence  jervis baby slap the cuffs on her  all ive got is a rubber band and some twisty ties  its fine its great just call the police  gotta go peace  mr spencer good work on that retirement community case  heres your check to show our gratitude  thank you  and in case you were wondering miss cloverfield made a full confession  im sorry chief  this demon spawn is beyond my help ive tried threatening him  ive tried scaring him i even tried bribery  i told you
