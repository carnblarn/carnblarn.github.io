sergeant  you woke up naked in a field with your ass hanging out  yeah thats right  i mean i dont remember exactly what they look like  you know its all really confusing for me right now  when you say they just who are you referring to  the aliens  see  right aliens here it is  page two got it  how would you describe these aliensmr turk  would you say they were small would you say they were green  i i dont really recall right now ive got this headache and  who is that person over there  because hes really making me uncomfortable  im makingyouuncomfortable right now  dude is there any reason why youre not wearing clothes now  hey i think i might have been abducted all right  i believe i mightve been experimented on  so theres no way im going to touch these clothes and compromise evidence  okay okay mr turk  please try to gain control of your considerable person  why dont you cover up with a towel thats why its there  one size fits all i hope  all right  ill cover up with the towel but first  does somebody want to check me for scars  oh good lord  o i know you know that im not telling the truth o  o i know you know they just dont have any proof o  o embrace the deception o  o learn how to bend o  o your worst inhibitions o  o they will psych you out in the end o  are you really willing to just dismiss the idea  that theres life on other planets   this is what ive got i know he was dragged out there  otherwise no sign of assault nothing taken  aside from the embarrassment of waking up nakedin a field  weve got nothing to hang our hats on  i guess technically we could have hung our hats on it  shawn sure  look if its not the alien thing  then how do you explain the memory loss  the confusion the fact that he saw a little green man  hallucinations   no  what  dude youre the expert here  come on man theres got to be some drug that would cause a combination of those three things  think  drugs   oh youre asking me  sure  well let me see  off the top of my head  any ssris tramadol bupropion  proton pump inhibitors  thats what im talking about thank you  venlafaxine ropinirole  thats good work buddy  b adrenoreceptor antagonists  okay gold star for gus  phencyclidine ketamine bufotenine  youre not going to stop are you  did i already say venlafaxine  theres no way to be sure  wait wait a second  didnt he say something to you about about smelling lavender  he said right before he blacked out  he rembered the strong scent of lavender and seeing uh barbed wire  right  wait a second gus thats not a hallucination thats a location   thats what im saying  and i know exactly where it is  dude ive driven by this place at least twice  the question is what arethe cops doing here  johnny  oh  look i saw the picture of that turk guy in the paper  now its me in a field naked  headache you do the math  do you rember seeing anything out of the ordinary  uh i dont remember much at all  so you just woke up in a field wearing nothing but your birthday suit  look i told you yes already are you going to give me a hard time  cause im a little freaked out as it is  and can somebody get me a bigger towel  this thing is like the size of a wash cloth  what are you some kind of pervert  cut him some slack hes just doing his job  you think he gets his jollies taking pictures of your dingdong  lassie  what are you guys doing here  this is my case  you gave it to me rember  look its a copycat okay  he saw turks picture in the paper hes looking for attention  so he wakes up and sees turk in the paper naked  humiliatedthe butt of jokes at the water cooler and says hmm   how can i make this work for myself  what  plus its really itchy out here  when you get your masters degree in criminology  then you can call me  in the meantime ive got a halfeaten enchirito in my car  all right here we go youre up  what do it   im not doing that  dude  i took the fat guy in the police station  im not doing that   this is a much better  im not doing that  were partners  gus  what does this case have to do with a tanning salon  its the middle of winter in santa barbara  those dudes looked like gingerbread men without tan lines  they fake and they bake  shawn exactly how closely did you look at these naked guys  too close  my heightened observational skills  are considered a gift by most  but im here to tell you it can be a burden  how do you know its this place  keiser didnt have any streaks on his buttocks okay  that screams the instatan process   and this is the only place that does that  right  plus they both live within a mile and a half of this joint  i cant ring this hello  hello  look im going to snoop around okay  you find out if turk or keiser were here and if so when  oh shawn shawn   this is not going to work  dude ive got to do my thing   ive got to mix it up nice  but  you always complain you dont get to do the questiony part  questiony part gus right but  youre forgetting something  may i help you  yes  im here for a tanning appointment  for yourself  yes for the instatan process  i would like that  but  what  well youre yes  uh i dont understand  okay look screw it i cant do it  have you seen either of these two guys here before  fred turk or philip keiser  shawn shawn  okay both turk and keiser not only have been here  but theyre regulars  he says its always the single guys who try to keep up with their tans   single guys  yeah  maybe thats it maybe some woman is targeting singles at the salon  the question is what kind of a oser thinks getting a tan  is going to help him score a woman  dad  dad what are you doing here  the real question is what are you doing here  well george hamilton were on a case  or maybe you missed the pictures of the guys in the paper in the fields  yes of course i saw the nudists  guy in the field thinks he was abducted by aliens  idiot what does that have to do with this place  well theyre both regulars here  they both happen to be single  so this could be a stalking case  wait a second your dad is single and he comes here all the time   everybody comes here  what is that  what  exfoliating scrub  with pumice  whatever shawn  all i know is when i varnish my boat and i dont want it to streak  i sand off a layer first  same thing goes with tanning  that is the single most disturbing analogy i have ever heard in my entire life   where are they  who  the queer eye guys  i know theyre here somewhere gus what are their names  how am i supposed to know shawn  carson and jai  and the guy with the glasses   who cooks a fish  right  shawn you know what your real problem is  you got yourself another case and as usual youre shortsighted  you think its all impressive cause you see a couple of nude guys in a field  you put a fix on em here  well its not enough  this is what we know  both these guys are trying to impress someone  which means a woman was involved  and that same woman was with them in the field  shawn saw a womans shoe strap in the field  how or why she connects to them i just  i just dont know yet  well youre not looking close enough  believe me ive looked just about as close as i can bear  im with you on the aliens thing  theyre here and theyve swapped out my father with jose eber  i think your dad might be right  i think we should get turk and keiser in the same room  and actually ask them some questions  fine lets do it  the rule is all slacks all the time no exceptions  i hear that ive reached my naked man quota for the year  hello  well be there  step inside guys your case just became legitimate  consider yourself hired  i need

question i guarantee its going to come down to spray tanning  well this guys never seen the inside of a tanning salon  i dont think he ever saw the sun  youve got 24 hours call me with something  time of death  looks like we might have to open a kennel for all these copycats  well back to square one  i dont know shawn  maybe square one is the answer  maybe this is something beyond our comprehension

question freddy and please be honest  were you on time for these interviews  yes why do you ask  i have no reason  i think theres a woman involved here who had it out for these guys  we need to get a firsthand look at this speeddating phenomenon  not for 100 bucks we dont  gus please leave it to me  let me get this straight  there is a dead body and a murder loose in our city  and you want the

when lassiter checked his place  he found a stack of the questionnaires  in his apartment  tell me about these  marvin  look i dont know anything about any crime  i just  i used the names and the numbers  to get dates man thats it  i dont have 100 bucks  to slap down on some entrance fee  not on my crap salary so yeah  and besides thats why they go there  they go there for dates right  so why not me  why dont you think about that  while youre trying to take a crap  in front of six other guys  look okay  come on all right  all i did was i took some questionnaires  out of the trash  thats it  whats the charge not littering  so if you dont have anything more  id like to get to work  think hes telling the truth  not by a long shot  and look at him hes not the right height  he doesnt even own a car  i mean he cant match the tire tread  hes cocky  he thinks hes on a roll  but im inside his head chief  and im about to hang a lopez around the frontal lobe  and shoot right out of his nose onto his vest  you smell where im stepping  he had a partner  you let him go back to work  hes going to lead us right to the person  and ill be able to pick him out  psychically  you have my word  id

another 100  but i was watching you  and youre not very good at this  police business scat  okay  i need to breathe  and i need some space to do my thing  okay  shawn   oh good buddy you got the message  its not darcy youre in the clear  youre going to pay shawn  you are going to pay believe me  no offense but its tough to feel threatened by you  when youre wearing that shirt  is that a hibiscus  its not my shirt shawn its your dads shirt  he had to loan me one because  mine was covered in snot tears  i cant  did you know he also takes bubble baths  so did john wayne  i know but can you name one other guy  whats going on  i solved the case  its actually got a decent twist  have a seat  well im actually kind of an adventurist you know  i was caught in an avalanche once  in order to survive  i drank my own urine  and i ate three of my toes  which is you know  maybe why you saw me limp when i came in  hey big guy you mind if i cut in here  oh i dont know were kind of in a   youre going to be okay  okay  gee i really hope that wasnt rude  it seemed a little rude  well actually i should thank you  because he was awful  that is a very nice name  but youre kind of cute  so navy blue is your favorite color  mines green  you know you seem european  you sure you dont have family history there  whats your mothers maiden name  so after volunteering for the animal shelter   i decided  can i stop you for a moment  im so sorry im so sorry  uh everybody  im sorry if i could just get your attention  for a sec here im sorry  i want to pick this up right where we left off  if theres any time left on the clock okay  because you seem like a terrific person  you deserve someone special  someone who makes you feel safe  but also a little dirty  you know what im talking about  everyone deserves someone special  each and every one of you all of you  look is your perfect match here tonight  i dont know im not sure  but the point is youre here  and you put your hearts on the line  and thats all that really matters  unfortunately there are two people here  that do not share your pure desires  theyre not here to find their soulmates  theyre not here to fall in love  as a matter of fact theyre not even single  you glenda and you marvin  zre a couple  an odd couple to be sure but a couple  matter of fact   youre married  this is absurd  the tan lines on your fingers  where your wedding rings used to be will prove  please not with the tanning thing again  that not only are you married  but that tanning had something to do  with this investigation thank you chief  now the question  is why would a married couple  infiltrate a singles event  well the answer is simple  its a perfect place to commit their crime  theyre here to rob you ladies and gentlemen  to steal from you the one thing  that is invariably your own  identity  i told you that leprechaun was bad  marvin  did copy the questionnaires  to get these peoples phone numbers  and addresses and you glenda
