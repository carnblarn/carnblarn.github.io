screening of that movie with the whales  star trek iv the voyage home  the last time i was in chicago i was doing a reading from my autobiography  right we booked that  rememberrobin told us hed never

lameo whos dating kate moss  hes britishand nobody knows who he is  okayfine too inside  stephen dorff always solid  dude  come here  why would this kid have these mockups  because i think our missing person has a secret identity  by dayhes a laptoptoting comicloving virgin  at night  hes your favorite blogger  you think the malcontent is the kid  he mustve pissed off the wrong people with his blog  shawnlook  one down two to go  there goes the kid onaspendingspree theory  keith moon  i just went over the posts on malones blog  did he bash anything in particular  the red phantom movie hes relentless  its weirdbecause if you go back a little he was originally saying great things about it  so  so parastone pictures paid him to praise the red phantom flick  that must be where all the money from his room came from  makes sense  malones blog started the bad buzz which sunk parastones last comic book movie   i dont think the nipples helped eithergus  wellyeah  so the studio had everything riding on this new film  they wouldve done anything to prevent history from repeating itself  but malone blazed the red phantom anyway  he renegedwhich might be why hes missing we need to find those execs  hey any progress  i picked up malones astral trail  thats what its called  it leads to a hotel across from the convention center room 428  oak doorcant miss it  thats more specific than usual  sometimes the spirits are in a giving mood  nowyou wont find malone  but i sense some seriously dark jujumagumbo went down in there  yeahsend some uniforms to the hotel across from the convention center  and tell them to cordon off room 428  good  this had better be for real  sohows the convention a lot of cool stuff going oni bet  ohcome on not youtoo   youre a collectortoo  since middle school  i just got hiltz koolers autograph  shut up you did not  yesi did  himissing kid worried mom can we focus here  since when did you get so structured  since you turned into urkeland and you  just became  jan brady  tina yothers theres its  theres not an exact  match for that  you didnt want to tell her about our suspicions of the parastone executives  pleasegus we have to leave something to divine later  yeah  this is nice  some good oneonone time  letting the guard down  you knowi had an idea not too long ago and its funny i should think of it now  but it really doesnt make any sense to have so many officers working the daytime shift at grab   detective  most car thefts occur at night   lassiter  if you were to split the shift   nowgo with me on this one  carlton   what  my water just broke   are you sure  nocarlton  theres water spilling out of me for some other reason  ohno   ohcan you move my briefcase  your briefcase  it might be in the line of the  do you

okayyou and i need to create a third imaginary assistant thats completely incompetent  i think her name should be beatrice  what say you  all right  yeahjust send it to my assistant  its tremendous  you dont mind itthough you dont mind all the comic book stuff  its funharmless  a little wishfulfillment  ohcome on  you didnt pretend to fly around like superman when you were a kid  souhpretty high stakes on the red phantom moviehuh  we took a bath a couple of years ago on this other comic book movie  the adventures of the green spirit  yeahthe nipple flick  is that all anyone remembers about that movie  yes  we had to build a landfill for the unsold action figures  so were pulling out all the stops to launch the trailer for the red phantom movie  you knowlasersmusic  dent even organized this whole pyrotechnics display  word of mouth is the first and most vital step in this world  vital enough to pay somebody off   what  hmm  lets say theres a bloggerright  and hes wielding way more power than he shouldand he can be had for a price  you guys would be fools not to take a shot right   who are youshawn  im a psychic  i work with the police im investigating a disappearance  malone

ask him together  dent is back at our convention headquarters  fine  so no scungillithen  i didnt expect you to be so cooperative so if i seemed a little pushy  accusing me of kidnapping  i accused you of bribery  i implied you may have had something to do with the kidnapping  theres a difference  a lot of couples start off on the wrong foot  it just means we have nowhere to go but up  wellwhen youre done here with dent were done  what the  oh my godwhats happened here  where is he  some seriously dark jujumagumbo went down in here  two down one to go  okaygood news  your boss is innocent  bad news  he just became a face on a milk carton  mchecked malones blogagain today  there are more entries blazing the red phantom movie  i think malone was kidnapped before the blogs showed up  he was probably going to honor his deal with parastone  so the kidnapper is the one roasting this new movie online  he also wrotethe guilty will pay  the guilty will pay wow  one of these comic book freaks has clearly blurred the line between reality and  comic book  the kidnapper still has one more person to snatch  and it appears hes targeting anyone involved in this bribery scamso  talia  talia has to be the next victim  we need to get the real police in here  hello  ohhellomrtakei what can i do for you  just name it  hold on  its for you  gdawg whats uphandsome  beatrice  i canned her

malonethe malcontent  because it was his tidal wave of bad buzz that sunk your flick  you were on the brink of becoming a mogul but then it all slipped away  now youre reduced to cursing nipples and signing autographs at conventions  like a classic supervillain you were driven mad by revenge  you read malones blogslooking for clues to his true identity  then one daylike manna from heaven  the malcontent blogged he was coming here  you also read the execs that screwed your character would be heretoo  all the people that wronged you in the same place at the same time  the opportunity was too good to pass up  and you could hide your identity by wearing a costume  and every time you snatched one of your victimsyou left a note  just like fear career in your comic  yespeoplethis was written by a criminal  there is malice in the ink  i can see it now  hiltz always had a very distinctive way of writing the letter o  it has  a swoop  im sure if the police analyze this autograph  theyll see the handwriting is an exact match for the kidnappers threatening notes  this is the same thing that happened in san antonio  where are your victims  my plan is already in motion and theres nothing you can do to stop it  somebodys recreating the crime from this comic book   what happens in this thing  he sets them on fire  theyre near fire  dent even organized this whole pyrotechnics display  under
