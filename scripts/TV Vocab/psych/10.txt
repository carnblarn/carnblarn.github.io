but we are definitely finished  i hope you dont mind being a rebound  oh i usually prefer it  but not in this case  why not  primarily because hes not cheating on you  look he took your jewelry because hes trying to figure out your ring size  he took you to tiffanys  to buy that fancy necklace  because hes really trying to scout out what kind of stones and settings you like  what about last friday  oh come on the eastland center  theres no bars or clubs there  he wasnt there with a chick  he was probably on the north side of the parking lot at robbins brothers  picking out the ring  my address book  he called your parents to ask for your hand  hes doing it right  do you think i should call him  ill let you be the psychic on that one  ray  yeah i need you to tell me the truth  if you

impressive reasoning ive ever seen  is there a punch line coming lets get to it  i dont know how you do it  i mean its not psychicness  we both know thats a crock of crap  but you sir  are unstoppable  guaranteed arrest  whats happening here  can i tell you a secret  i wouldnt recommend it no  you know how everyone thinks my wife and i have been separated for nine months  yes  two years  two years tonight and im the one that keeps trying to fix the thing  i mean counselling therapy acupuncture you name it  i have tried to try to try it  well  im going to let you go  dont drive  you know i used to be a good cop  seriously  stunning arrest record  it was one of the best in the departments  i caught the back bay killer  yes you did i remember it well  although i had a tip   the blue sedan  yeah  that was you   it might have been  see what i mean  come on you still had to put it all together  spencer  blue sedan was the key to the whole thing it was the murders car  yeah but who had to run the plates  all those numbers and letters could have confused many a cop  spencer stop okay  i am done  here i want you to have these  i dont need them  i am over  all right just stop this  this is nonsense youre not over  look youre a striking man  with strong features  eyes that women want to do cannonballs into  you have great posture and penmanship the likes ive never seen  no  i have officially hit rock bottom  a month ago i got this case right  a healthy 42yearold astronomer dies  doesnt drink doesnt smoke  spends all day in an ergonomically designed chair charting the night sky  natural causes  thats what the coroner comes back with  does a full autopsy  no red flags nothing  i know he was murdered  i just cant  what what is this  prove it  department wont even let me pursue it  come on  youll figure it out  no i wont  i cant and ive accepted that  all right look lassie  carlton  i believe in you  i really do  you just  youve just got to trust your instincts  i just got engaged   oh my god  thank you  thank you thank you  i got engaged  ill never ever see you again bye  stick with it lassie you  you can solve this thing  youre halfway there already   psych saison 1   episode 10  from the earth to starbucks   i know you know  that im not telling the truth  i know you know  they just dont have any proof embrace the deception  learn how to bend your worst inhibitions  they will psych you out in the end  hey lassie  what is it spencer  how you doing you okay  all right ill bite  whats the joke  just wanted to make sure you got home all right last night  from what  from the bar   what bar  you were at a bar  no i wasnt at a bar i dont drink  you dont drink  well okay wine  at weddings  an occasional snifter of brandy  maybe a good singlemalt scotch  sounds like drinking to me  spencer  stop making up stories okay theyre obviously bogus  okay so you were not at tom blairs pub last night  i dont even know who tom blair is  and howd you get that sweet bruise on your forehead  i had an altercation  yes with a table  with a suspect  if were done i would really like to move on with my day  i get it  yesterday was a  a tough anniversary for you  what  who have you been talking to  nobody  ill get out of your hair  okay  we got to solve that case  what case  the one lassiter cant solve  hes going to hire us for a case  oh god no hed never do that  so we wont get paid  exactly  and were just doing it for the glory  nope  we give lassiter all the credit  in fact i dont even think he can know were helping him  dude thats a good idea shawn  i ditch out of work on the day we release three new products  to spend time on an unsolvable case in which we wont get paid  and someone else gets all the credit  that quite honestly is some of the best nutshelling ive ever heard  we made a deal  yesterday were equal partners  that means we collectively decide which appointments to make which cases to take  we have to live by that at least for a day especially today  youre right  thank you  thats going to be a problem though  why  because weve already got a meeting with the dead guys widow  when   10 minutes  10 minutes  look dont worry im going to do it in the chiefs office  i just need you to stand guard at the door make sure no one catches us in there  its going to double the excitement  maybe triple it  now come on whos in  dont fool around  you know i cant hold my hand like this for very long  gus i get very poor circulation to the limbic regions  now my pinkys going numb  i guess everything started to change at the beginning of last summer  he partnered with his old friend hugo  and they finally got accepted for eight months on the new digital telescope  at the space center  everything was normal for two weeks and then suddenly  bryant started to work really long hours  i see  what do you think of this  i like it  its a gift from a friend  hes a glassblower  would you say thats when he started feeling sick mary  not sick just a little off  oh we did cancel our 4th of july trip so i guess it was around that time  im sorry something is really bugging me  your name is lassiter too  yes thats correct  carlton lassiter  but youre not affiliated with the detective carlton lassiter who i met before  not in any way shape or form  different department  matter of fact i spell mine with a k  two of them  mary is there anything youre leaving out  maybe something thats slipped your mind  something youre not telling me because it may embarrassed andor shame you  it could be vital  i know this probably isnt true but i started to suspect that he  was cheating on you  well yes  how did you know  a shot in the dark  the long hours  he was consumed with his work  he was different distant  i dont even like to say it out loud  please dont  bryant wasnt really the type  we were planning a future  he wanted to try for a baby  he was a good man  thanks again for coming in mary  no problem k karlton  carlton  yes karlton with a k  two ks  the second one is silent  may i speak to you privately in your office kkarlton  certainly   well be in touch  thanks  what are you doing reopening the vallery case  reopening  come on that word has so many syllables  that case was determined not to be a case despite detective lassiters best efforts  shawn  now i need a whole lot of an explanation from you  because although you do make me laugh occasionally  impersonating an officer  impersonating an officer please  i told that woman i was in accounts payable  shawn  come clean  i would like to solve this case for lassiter  hell never allow it  thats why he cant know im involved  i figure i can guide him through this thing right  build him up get him back on his feet again  youre serious  yeah  why  i just  you know like he really needs this  i mean look at him  okay im in  youre what  what do you got  my dad is not answering his phone  so  so hes always home  and he always answers his phone after two rings  this is actually somewhat troubling  why  why  fish derbys on  what is this  its the bryant vallery case  the one from this morning  and the rest of the week  i predict we will solve it friday at 1001 pm  and then maybe watch some cable  sounds great  and did you find a partner thats willing to do this with you  jules is in  my dad is clearly missing or something  dude that leaves you  gus you get to step up in a big fat way  you have one job  i have two jobs shawn  i have presentations to memorize on three new drugs  and while you were out drinking last night and taking on free cases  i was up half the night dreaming about whether the gelcaps are more effective than the tablets  first of all tablets  always tablets  thats a given  secondly ive been having this reoccurring dream  where im flying over auckland on the back of a swan made primarily of cocoa  his name is clem  but your dream was  pretty interesting too  and thirdly i guarantee you that after you hear this reason  you will definitely want to take this case  i doubt it but give it a shot  the victim was an astronomer  yeah  the guy died while he was working the night sky at the observatory  what would make you think that would matter  oh come on i know you go down to the space center  thats preposterous shawn  thursdays   im never there  in the afternoon around 200  have you been following me  maybe  sometimes  to sharpen and refine my tailing skills yes  this is exactly the sort of thing i was talking about shawn  okay i apologize gus  i do but its all good  so you like astronomy  i accept that  this conversation is over  okay dont go all vincent gallo on me were just getting started man  look some guy dies at a space center that you frequently sneak off to  we got to get down there and we got to do some serious spacedigging  no we dont  as a matter of fact  now that i know youre tailing me while im at work  get ready to get lost in my dust  okay dust  what are you going offroading  im going to be uncatchable  like a jackal  like a jackal  how about i just tail you to the observatory  consider me stealth shawn  dude thats weird  its like youre  like youre a bobblehead  excuse me  i have an annual pass  oh im sorry sir  i didnt see you standing there  you know being so stealthlike  the jackal has arrived  we are not doing shawn what are we doing  dude were undercover  we arent undercover  sure we are  im the employee youre the customer  i am the customer  see youre already in character like don cheadle  im not involved with this case  i only need you for a minute  like when kenickie need danny zuko  and you get to be travolta in the analogy  tomorrow theyre training me on the motion simulator  tell me youve never wanted to take a ride on one of those things buck naked  no i havent  sure you have   im only here for a few minutes anyway  thats all i need  look theres this creepy janitor that lurks about  i want you to distract him while i grill planetarium girl  you are not grilling jessica  shes just interning here till she gets her college units  jessica  yeah  how do you know her name is je  oh gus  what  you havent been coming here on thursdays to study the stars  youve been coming here for her you love her   shut up shawn  youre in love with her   shut up shawn  come on ill hook you guys up  no shawn  she is my coworker  and i have the inside track  listen there are ways to go about doing this  you dont just walk up to somebody at their place and start working them over   you got to have a plan  do you have a plan  of course i have a plan  well would you mind cluing me in please  all right listen  shes been through a lot lately   she just  broke up with her boyfriend  how did you know that  its my curse apparently  well since shes just off a breakup i got to move gradually  just go over there and ask her out  get her digits  shawn this is a quality girl  that means ive got to put in quality time okay  oh here she comes  act natural  hey jessie  do you know gus  yes   gus is a regular  thats right  you know i went to high school with him  of course i didnt hang out with cool kids like gus in high school  he was a cif wrestling champion back then  really  true as toast and in college he was a heisman candidate until he blew his knee out  dont act all surprised  we were all following you in the newspapers man  youre kidding   well he is actually  i dont kid ever  i idolized this guy  coolest dude i have ever known  wow gus it seems theres a lot i dont know about you   well there is  yeah you guys should totally talk  you know  share stuff and whatnot and dont let this guy grill you too much  yeah well id love to but i have to start the planetarium show   yeah she has a planetarium show  oh can i do that  have you been trained on the show  oh yeah yeah yeah yes i just did the checklist like an hour ago  perfect score uh  question 18 has a typo  okay great  go ahead then  are you serious  oh this is great   great  all right i got it  no worries no worries  i got it  thanks shawn  that guy  i heard about pluto  thats messed up right  yeah  heres the bryant vallery file  w what  the astronomer  yes and i just finished the followup with mary the widow  you what  you asked me to  i did  it was in passing and wow did it ever pay off you were right about the affair  i was  yeah the wife totally suspected it  she what  that he potentially was having an affair  well isnt that interesting  i want to reinterview everybody and give me a copy of the coroners report  i told you there was more to this case  hello ladies and gentlemen  i will be your narrator  my name is aurora borealis  there are  over four  hundred stars in our galaxy  maybe more  no one knows for sure  many have said that the universe is even larger than the indian ocean  and that is why it is called infinitum staroctopussium  ah yes our glorious constellations  there they all are take a look  over here we have  one with a guy  holding some sort of thing  over here  our beloved olympic rings  all seven of them and here  heres one with a fish  you got to name em  notice  straight  straight above you  the hammer of jeff   and over there in the south  north  north youll see  monkey with rash  the egyptians used to set their clocks by him  oh look   theres goes an asteroid  comet  comet its what they named that cleaning solution after  i know it may stink when you leave it in the sink  but boy oh boy does it clean  is there a reason youre standing so close to me  just looking  yeah well thats the great thing about looking  you can do it from far far away  yeah  and now ladies and gentlemen  i implore you to enjoy  the majesty  of the heavens  hey   oh  you work here  no i just uh  i just happen to own my own space suit  a smart ass i like that get over here kid  do me a favor  keep your finger on this space bar while i adjust this  like this  uhhuh  youre going to trust me with this  i dont have a lot of other options do i space man  i got to be honest this seems like a job for two no  sometimes it is but once the scope is in place  all you got to do is watch the monitor hoping to catch things that nobody else has  you know if youve got a partner you can switch off  you know rest your eyes maybe make calculations on what youve seen or just  break up the silence of staring into the unknown  so wheres your partner  thats the bad part of it he passed away not too long ago  you know the buddhists have this saying about  moving on  honoring the work  but i dont remember it  what i do know  is that i realize im too old  to be doing this stuff all alone  so youre uh  youre continuing the work huh   bryant would return from the grave  if i didnt  you know we petitioned for five years  for use of this scope  and we got lucky  no no no no no no  dont touch no  i mean once you get in here  you got to find what youre looking for fast  we had eight months  bryant saw six  eight months seems like a good chunk of time  not in astronomy  see once you find it  you got to track it  ok and then its not a discovery until you chart it  and then it goes around again and then you prove it  must get lonely  i let you in here didnt i   look i just  i talk  you know ive got the gift of the gab  jeez ill talk to anybody i suppose  so you uh  you still havent found what youre looking for huh  no but when i do  youll read about it believe me  youll read about it  my real goal is to become an astronomer  see something no one else has  i dont need to make a big flashy discovery  or name a star  or become famous   like most of these guys want  hey  all ive ever really wanted   is to know i made a difference  thats great  knowing what you wanted to do since you were a kid   thats a gift  thanks  you know youre a great listener gus  oh well its easy to talk to you jessica i mean  is something wrong  theyve been in there 45 minutes  so   its a fourminute show  and that ladies and gentlemen  is precisely why time travel is not only possible  but may have already happened  so i met the other astronomer  nice guy chatty  hiding something   something nefarious   i dont know yet  howd you do   please shawn  how do you think    digits  you know this   nice   were going out tomorrow  its all coming together man  juliet called she ran our dead guys phone records   we got to meet her at the station  you bet lets go  oh not now   500  why 500  gus i cant just leave  willynilly whenever i want  i have a job to do here  i dont care what the coroner says  healthy hearts do not just stop  but you know what   ive got a golf buddy whos a cardiologist  im going to run these by him  mind the store ill be back  hey   okay so we ran the home  the work and the cell phone records of bryant vallery  we got nothing on the home phone  a few strange hits on the work line  but when we ran the cell phone we hit the jackpot  we found a number that he calls  only from his cell phone all hours of the night  way too often for business  unless its monkey business   sweet  so we contacted the cell company for the name  the number is   well where is it  oh here it is   555019  9  wow thats good  not really  so she had an affair with a married guy  and probably lied about it  that doesnt mean shes guilty  shawn youre confusing me  youre the one who loves to jump to conclusions  and youre not even hopping toward this one   hopping  it doesnt track gus why would she kill him   she broke up with a guy its him he dumped her  so why doesnt she mention to you  that her exboyfriend just bit the dust  what is she going to say  hey hows it going   my boyfriend just died  he might have been killed maybe it was me hi hi hi   i doubt she chortles  man she was so damn goodlooking  and she still is  gus even if we have a who  we dont have a clear motive  and we certainly dont have the method  we cant give up on our other suspects  what we need to do  is keep looking  youre going to set off the alarm  clearly i have a security pass  they gave you a security pass  they gave dave the cheddar corn guy a security pass  i merely stumbled upon it by happenstance  and by happenstance you mean   i swiped it from his gym bag  while he was shaking a milky way loose  from the vending machine dammit i  what are you doing shawn  what i dont have is a key   thats not right  what  im sorry i just i   i left pogo stick in there and i just   no i mean youre not doing it right  you got to move upward  if you want to get the latch to disengage  let me do it  dont you have a key for that   for this room  no  big bad bryant took it away  a few weeks after they got here  why   a few small items go missing  suddenly everyone gets suspicious  items such as  a watch a comb some mail  whose mail   the dead guy bryant   did you read it   well of course i did  you know he became quite a jerk  i dont know if hugo knows this or not  but he was dissolving the partnership  apparently he had some big plans for himself  correspondence for jobs he didnt seem qualified for  like heading university departments   at nasa   nasa   now who are you guys again  we think something bad went down in there  yes something bad did go down in here  did you see anything  no but you know the dead guy he changed  they were friends at the beginning  hugo was always being nice to him you know  in fact hugos the only one around here  whos nice to me  he brings me coffee in the mornings  although he brings it for everybody  all four of us  three of us  stallings ill be nice to you just do me a favor  stop stealing the gum out of my locker okay    you spotted that  sure did  hey uh  do you know how these books worked  oh they switched up every couple hours  one looks one writes  you know they do it from dark till dusk all the time  hugos here  how do you know that   ah he gets here at the same time every day  you could set your clock to it  um hey you should hurry you dont have long  thanks dude   gus come check this out  what   look theres a page missing from this log book  i noticed it the first time i was here look   june 21st  what does the book track  its like stallings said its like  every manual adjustment they make  who does it which guy was on the scope  see it looks like they switch shifts about every two hours right   so why remove this page   you go from 839 with hugo  to 1042 with bryant  so the question is  what happened between 839 and 1042  on june 21st   some bad juju  we got to get out of here  why   why  gus  if someone finds me in here i could get fired  why do you keep running like that  hey you guys  um hey whats up   gus about tonight  oh if you have other obligations   thats cool  no i just wanted to see  if we could go at 630 instead  thats perfect thats even better  look i need to borrow your motorcycle tonight  you can use my little blue car  ooh yeah do that gus  i get a little nervous on motorcycles   settled bye jess   bye  i think you are this one  whats that in his case  tracking readouts  dude its just a bunch of paperwork  i saw it at the observatory  why does he keep it locked up like that  thats a good question  morning gentlemen    you off already   i had to check  the timers on the crab spray  you need any help with that giant thing   nah i can manage it  only got two more weeks of this before my times up  might as well follow it through to the end  you know what that means  i have no idea what that means  that means hes not at his house  so   rainiers not exactly a high roller huh   look at that it should say  welcome to camp something  huh  stargazing isnt the most lucrative field  well  you can make up to a hundred grand a year  on the lecture circuit if youre a name  youre going to break that  i dont think so   whoa   what   oh boy  what is this awful purple stuff   theyre flowers   flowers   its a garden  its a vegetable garden these are flowers  weird flowers  what are you doing   well ive got to check this out  let lassiter do that  gus lassiter has to come here on his own  and hes got to be right  so who are you going to get to check that out for us   well who else do you know who spends all day in his yard   shawn   oh you shouldnt have  dad we need to talk business  youre not answering your phone  whats going on  did you even check it   the phones been fine shawn  im just a little

lot of thought  its been 15 years  yeah  you know what its fine its great good for him   you want to talk about it   no  good you left your plant there   i know  want to go back and get it   no  okay june 21st is missing from the log book   no ill check on that right away  sweet  so uh does lassiter need any more help   no shawn hes on fire  hes already had the autopsy test rerun  and hes contacted every relative that he had   that a personal call ohara  yes  well wrap it up i think im onto something  i think he was killed by someone he knew  i got to go  bryant vallery opened a safety deposit box account in june   was it on june 21st   what was on june 21st   i dont know didnt you say something  about june 21st yesterday   ive said so many things the last few days  refresh my memory   dude you look sharp  thank you   i got one more thing for you  whats that   you want me to wear a wire   just this little baby one  look in the event that she actually did it right    shes not going to suspect you  forget it shawn  im gonna sit down with her for 30 minutes  ask a few questions and keep it cool  just in case  just in case she didnt kill the guy  all right heres a compromise   let me follow you  no  come on from a safe distance   itll be like 30 yards  consider me stealth shawn  be  be careful  you know we have a mirror in the bathroom  you seem  jumpy  me   oh no no no im excited  so uh  tell me about this guy you just broke up with  exes   ooh dont you know  the numberone rule of first dates gus   im very comfortable talking about anything   well theres not much to tell really  mmhmm   about a month in i find out hes married  right  just my luck  and then he kept calling  he actually thought id be okay  with the whole dirty scenario he just  he wasnt the guy i thought he was  in a lot of ways  wow thats thats great  why   i dont know  hey im sorry about having to go earlier  its just everything changed at the observatory  and i got to get to work early tomorrow so  whats going on  well dont tell anyone but  hugo and bryant  may have discovered a planet   get out of here   yeah  an extrasolar planet  about six months ago i think  bryant kind of clued me in the night they found it  he was so excited  they had to track their data wait for the planet   to come around again and complete its orbit  right  so it must be verified now  i mean you dont just call press conferences for nothing right   hugo is over the moon  yeah hes going to be famous forever  do you have any idea how huge  this is for someones career    um   of course he does    shawn   i was in stealth mode    how did you find me   you knew he was following you   no not at all  jessica this is a good thing   it means we dont suspect you anymore  we   suspect me of what    i didnt think you killed him jessica  kill him   and i hope this doesnt create trust issues for our future  we just need to establish motive  dude we totally established motive  well congratulations gus  whatever you are youve got your motive  whatever that is but you no longer have a date   no   jessie   jessica  hold on a second  gus   man thats twice   introducing the santa barbara space center  for the use of their facility  i dedicate this to my departed comrade   bryant vallery  professor  professor   when was the discovery made   the 21st of june   during a routine changeover  between my partner and myself  while readjusting some coordinates  i inadvertently made  what is certainly  the discovery of my lifetime  which one of you made the actual discovery   it was me we traded off chairs every two hours   this was completely by accident  what about a book   surely youll have a lot of book offers   gus you know what this means  its murder  its  no its motive  thats what i said  no you said its murder  thats the same thing motive murder   its the same thing  motive is the reason   for doing   its in the same family shawn   shh   now this planet  has everything required for an earthlike structure  it has proximity  it has the right orbit  it has its own energy source    you have got to change that phones settings  jeez   hello  shawn   what the hell do you think youre doing   look dad i cant talk to you about your love life ok    i cant do it  my love life   are you still on that  im talking about  this foxglove you left on my porch   foxglove   your little plant with the dirty roots  its all over my welcome mat   that was foxglove   what the hells foxglove   some neighbors cat could have wandered in  chewed on it and croaked right in my front yard shawn  some foxglove has a chemical  called digitalis in its leaves   what is that like poison  its a medicine  and you know how i feel about dead things in my yard  look dad im sorry i got to go  dad i cant have two people solving my case at once   shawn we should talk  ok fine  ill be at tom blairs pub on friday come by  i got a date on friday  can you do saturday   never mind  digitalis is prescribed for heart conditions  hows that help us gus   it can cause toxicity in someone without a heart problem   wouldnt that show up on an autopsy   thats the problem  you have to test for digitalis specifically  no one would consider it in someone  who doesnt have a history of heart problems  shh   hey what are you doing here   we just got our motive for murder spencer  hugo found out that vallery was going to take  all the credit for their discovery himself  caught them out entirely  because he was on the scope  when they made the find  yes maybe  what are you doing here   well we heard you had the
