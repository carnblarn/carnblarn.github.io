havent reenacted this one   for a while  but the battle   at pipers cove kentucky   1864     is special to me  it ended  confederate raider quantrills plot  to assassinate lincoln  and it involved   my greatgreatgrandfather    colonel muscum t lassiter  muscum    what the hell is a muscum     it was a very common name   of the era  history channel  espn gus  channel 206  im begging you  hey jules  want to join    oh can i  do you have your own hoop skirt    i rent one  sally reynolds    front and center  you missed your cue sally  the cannon fired   yet no sally    i got stuck  in the hospital tent  sergeant menish  had a quick question   about his homeowners policy   how touching  however today youre not here  to sell insurance sally    today you are here   to help me win the civil war  and according to our battle plan  when the fifth cannon fires    you exit the hospital tent  and you shoot captain quantrill off his horse   theres no need to get nasty  i agree totally out of line     sorry  i didnt think you could hear that     sally  sweet sally  if you do not point your gun  at captain quantrill  and fire at the prescribed moment  the audience  will not be able to make heads nor tails  of what we are doing  and it will appear  as if the evil   captain quantrill    now being portrayed    by our horrifyingly    methodacting nelson poe  who happened to roll way off his mark    by the way    fell off his horse     and is lying here for no apparent reason at all  get up nelson  nelson i swear to god    if youre sleeping   through rehearsal again    i said get up  okay  either that guy is a phenomenal actor   or hes dead      i know you know that im not telling the truth    i know you know they just dont have any proof       embrace the deception     learn how to bend      oh come on   let me in on this    no  i was there    inexplicably drawn   to the scene   i was meant  to solve this case     its sort of like    a miracle  you have been out there  every weekend weve rehearsed  and dont think i didnt see you    trying to throw mms in the injured soldiers mouths    okay first of all  those were skittles   and they have  a rainbow of flavors  the answer is still no     beat it    oh  hold it    im suddenly   seeing nelson    the bullet  traveling through the air    tearing ripping  pain   the bullet went  straight through his heart     this was not an accident   detective  i dont know how you know that  and i dont give a rats ass  this case is personal    one of my soldiers was killed on my watch  and i not you  am going to clean it up     we clear   i wouldnt have gone   with something as traditional as we clear     you couldve gone    foreign right  comprende capiche  could have had  a little fun with it  you dig my gist sweetpants    these are just suggestions  and to you the central reenactment committee   i say as of today    the event next weekend   is still on     pending an investigation  now most of you are cops    should we find   any evidence     that this was not    an accident   and do not  make an arrest   we will reevaluate  at that time  that said detective lassiter    i want to know how   i want to know who  i want to know why     oh   oh its kind of hard   to get off   it takes a long time  to unstick the glue   fine         thank you chief  pending the coroners report  id have to say there are no indications     of foul play     the general consensus   is that a live round  got mixed in with our blanks   mr mahoneys the regiments   munitions expert  and jeweler    one of santa barbaras   finest  he can expand on this   mr mahoney  as you know detective     we had live round target practice    this past weekend  along with you  we assumed a musket ball  got stuck in one of our rifles    laid there unseen  and then a blank was inserted  during the last rehearsal   poor nelson   a terrible terrible    tragic accident     our battles meant    so much to him     anyway    this is an official  police investigation     so lets focus    on our schematic    nail down   the specifics     detective ohara    please     hey  whats the deal   why do you keep  staring at me  one  its our understanding  that the victim was shot off his horse   at the top of the creek bank here         and then rolled  to the creek bed here  two we know nelson was facing west  were going to focus our attentions here   on the opposite bank  where we assume  the shot originated     assume     detective  spencer  what about three   the missing bullet  i saw it  ripping through nelsons body     in through the front    out through the back  and it still hasnt been found     wait   how do you know  all that  lassie you want to take this one    he had an episode  in the hallway  look i can handle this  myself     nelson   nelson youre going to  have to speak up   youre teeny  you were shot through the heart   no that was  privileged information  i didnt say anything    shh shh  are you sure about this     its bold    but ill run with it  he says people dont get shot through the heart  by accident     he says he was murdered   youre hired   you told them what  gus she was hot  and she was dressed as a nurse  you know how i feel about that  oh come on what was i supposed to do  not impress her  plus the tiny figurine  made a very convincing argument   i dont know how  youll prove murder    with two lousy   bullet holes  oh relax  i did some checking on nelson poe  nobody liked him ever  and second of all     what    dude i dont have   a second of all  and we know nelson  was on top of the ridge  facing the union soldiers over here  when he was shot  so schwartz take team a    check out that high grass  ohara take team b    start going over the ridge    do it     yes sir    find something amusing  mildly amusing  more odd  delightful in a queer sort of way     for your edification    the reenactment of  edification   yeah edification  is that legal     like in public    public edifications legal     it means for your information   why didnt you just say that   for your edification   the reenactment of battles  battles fought   by our forefathers   to preserve this union    is a sacred trust     what are you guys   doing here anyway  im a bit of a civil war buff     im reading the dirt    the trees    the hot dog stand  no real information there  but they do great sauerkraut  i may even be able to help you name a suspect     like i told you   were 95 sure this was an accidental shooting    what about the other five percent   if i am wrong we will hold a press conference     you two will be    cordially invited     to say i told you so    seems fair  hey     can i wear your face wig  what are you doing    shockingly lassiter is holding out on us   i do not think that he thinks   that this was an accident     what do you mean    i saw three names   checked off the roster     on his clipboard    what names    gus    i thought youd never ask      what is this  the battlefield  based on what    the briefing board at the police station     you did this from memory   yes  you said you saw it for two minutes     right two whole minutes     you got problems     factoid   a musket is accurate from 30 yards  poe  gc   gc  george cheslow     george cheslow  from sixth grade  little georgie     hes like a dentist now  really    see you   in six months    we go in we check it out     we see if george cheslow had any reason     to murder somebody    pop out    mr guster   the dentist will see you now    sweet  whoa me  my teeth are gorgeous  you said the appointment was for you  right   for me to do some snooping     because im a much better  snooper than you are  just keep him occupied  occupied how      gus stop it be a man         whats he saying  he says his teeth are gorgeous       im sorry shawn    but the reason you have to   be here too is   uh george gus has phobias  and being alone in the dentists chair is one   he could snap at any moment     this is actually    for your own protection  last time he bit off an index finger  thankfully i was there  they were able to save    everything but the nail   oops   pardon moi     honey can i talk to you  for a minute     oh sure    gentlemen duty calls    oh and the credit card wont go through  do you have any cash   oh uh sure yeah  ive got tennis then dinner with karen    okay ill hit   an atm  dont wait up if im late     oh okay     all right    bye sweetie    good shopping    rwowr    ah yes  george i heard you got married  but wow huh     yeah i know what    youre thinking   whats wrong  with this picture   but you know  where is it written  that the ugly guy never gets the girl     everywhere man     oh ah   no were fine  were good    thats better youre fine   dont worry about it  lets seehere     so uh   how is married life     treating you these days george   everything     everything solid   why are you snooping   around here shawn  you think i did this  because erlene was having an affair with poe   hmm     you didnt know     of course i knew george  im a psychic   it was over  completely over  im beyond it and erlenes beyond it    at least ithink she is   i     i had some gauze  right just  oh there we go    thank you  george    do you wear your glasses  out on the battlefield  oh i want to   but lassiter wont let me  says theyre not of the period    open andthere  if it makes you feel any better  gus here doesnt think   you did it  neither does shawn   well thanks guys    i appreciate that  oops  oops    small cavity  i dont have any cavities    its right on the surface   dont worry about it  ah ah   there we go  ah ah   theres my trouper  listen georgie  nobodys drilling in my mouth for anything   my teeth are perfect    george  why am i surprised    funny coincidence   hey jules  george i hate to say this  but youre under arrest  for the murder of nelson poe   what     on what grounds   you said it was  an accident   we discovered a stack of love letters    at nelsons house     indicating he was having  an affair with your wife  and that youd threatened to kill him   oh come on   i am so disappointed in you      all right okay okay         what did he say  first    i told you so     secondly i think    george cheslow   is an innocent man    yeah you know hes right   we do have a paperthin case   i mean all weve got     is motive means    and opportunity    look guys     i had a dream last night  i was sipping ice wine    with a baby tree monkey   then i fell and i landed in a wooded area  and thats where i saw nelson poe get shot     only in my dream    the shooter was much closer   than i originally thought   this is a minie ball    am i right     whered you get this    your desk    now its common knowledge   that minie balls cause huge  gaping holes in human flesh  which leads to a quandary  in my dream  why was   nelson poes exit wound     so small     if george cheslow  had been in that wooded area  he was way too far to make a shot  that caused such a little hole    whoever shot nelson was much much closer  and this whoever would be  engelbert humperdinck  so youve got nothing     thank you   for the random speculation  goodbye  mr spencer if you cant name names  im afraid hes right this time  fine  ill get you a name  and im going to get you a woman  afraid hes right   this time  its a gift actually   for my son  a surprise of sorts     this way he    my son     will be able    to keep track of time     for a change    kid was late at birth    hes been late   ever since

point the cops    in his direction right     exactly   hes not going to hang around    like a numbnuts   so heres the deal     i think nelson rolled    into this creek   and was shot  from that tree   right up there  and you figured this out  last night  when you fell on your ass down here by yourself  right on my ass   now all i need to do  is find the missing bullet  and how and where  do we find

the creek    way past his mark  four    looks up sees the bad guy     okay which means nelson   wasnt the original target  bingo     he interrupted the plan    okay look up there   and see if you see a notch     you know    that would steady a gun     a notch    yeah like a notch   it should lead us  to the intended target    thats not a notch  thats a notch  the hospital tent    i think i got it   what     sally reynolds  sally reynolds     sally reynolds  why would somebody want to kill sally reynolds  i have no idea   hey     whats up guys    youre going to get a call  from an irate sally reynolds   saying that two guys    stole her dress  just ignore it okay  what the hell are you doing  sally was the target  shawns going to put on that dress  and wait for someone to shoot him   right but the plan sounds a lot better  when you dont say it like that    listen detective  we have reason to believe that the intended target    was sally reynolds   now weve stolen her dress  well catch the yellowbellied son of a bitch   redhanded   i forced the ending     thats horrible  wait so risking getting shot  is the only way   to solve the case    absolutely  then we should stop the battle

where this leads       watch your head  aw did you get sewage on your feather  weve crossed  to the other side of the creek bed   the police accounted   for all the union soldiers   but nobodys

maybe someone    has bunions  bunions gus really  thats what youre bringing to the table  im trying to solve a murder here   i deal with bunions  at work every day   they hurt     they hurt people    thats a perfectly logical   assumption  yeah what about this  no tunic    this is mahoneys   what     the brass button    mahoney did it   thats why he had  that sticky musket    he mustve gotten sap
