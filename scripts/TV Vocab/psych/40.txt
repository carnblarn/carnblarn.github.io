realize you were checking up on him  he didnt suspect a thing  what did you find out  im sorry guys but carl seems like hes on the up and up  you didnt see him talking with any shady characters  no just the kids  and you know what hes a pretty good santa  i mean he just doesnt ask them what they want  he asks the kids what they like most about christmas  what theyre most thankful for  what relatives theyre going to visit  its quite touching  so thatll be 20 wallets and one 8 x 10  we can send it to a home address  just check the box  wait a minute thats it  what  what do you see  are you having a vision  its a small its a small its just a  tiny vision  cold shower baseball stats watching my grandmother eat meatloaf   shawn  i see carl and ted  standing in front of a computer screen  uh its a list of addresses  getting the information from the kids  about whos traveling over the holidays  gives them a builtin list of empty houses to rob  thats why he had to be out of jail on christmas eve  we need to warn the police before tomorrow  what the heck are you looking at  that  look how cute that little snowman is  i hear that  his cars still here so wheres carl  not a creature was stirring not even a mouse  much less a robber really  no one is here  not a single person hello  great  thanks for dragging us out here for nothing spencer  youre sure you sensed something was going to happen tonight  maybe we just missed them  we could try and figure out which houses they were planning on robbing  what do you do just randomly start knocking on doors  weve got better things to do come on ohara  how often are you wrong like this   not often  often  as usual they neglected to make one of the wise men black  and i thought everyone knew about balthazar  its ted  were not dealing with con artists  were dealing with murderers  thank you for coming mr spencer  now that this has become a murder case  were amping up the investigation  as you can imagine the city wants people to feel safe this holiday season  we brought carl into custody this morning  brittanys in the conference room with child protective services  so far we havent found anything to link carl to the murder  so technically we can only charge him with conspiracy to commit burglary  but were willing to recommend that the d a  cut a deal i f he cooperates in the murder investigation  did he take  he says hell only talk to you guys  so i need to know what you can get out of him  lets close the book on this one pronto  i i admit it  the santa job was just a long con to rob some people okay  but you got to believe me i i could never have killed ted  i know  ted was your inside man  i kept that from the police  ted and i were partners for a long time  we scammed people all up and down the coast  but we were just con men  we never physically hurt anybody that wasnt our thing  listen  whoever it was that killed ted  might be coming after me next  or even worse after brittany  i dont trust the cops to protect us  you got to stop them  how can we believe anything you say carl  fool us once shame on you  fool us twice shame on us  fool us thrice makes an ass out of u and me    nope  were soon parted   thats a fool and his money  what a fool believes   shawn  look  if they kill me theyre just going to throw brittany back in the system  now shes a tough little girl but shes already been through a lot all right  and im all shes got  sorry man  we dont trust you as far as gus can throw you  well now we know where brittany got this little trick  oh dude i think hes really crying  shawn  you know i cant handle it when a grown man cries  im a sympathetic crier  what  okay fine fine  well see what we can do  but you have to promise to cooperate fully  otherwise well have you dragged right back in here for this christmas con  deal thank you  stop it  do you know who may have wanted to hurt you or ted  we mightve kind of owed someone a little money  how about you be a little bit more specific  we were into our bookie for ten grand  thats why we were going to do the robberies  do you know where we can find this bookie  frank  works at two bars  oneils and the wild ox  sweet  well have to split up  you in the mood for hepatis a or c  excuse me wheres frank  all right  get me ten on do not resuscitate in the fifth race  i dont have any cash but give me your paypal account  and ill make a secure deposit online  some kind of joke  maybe i should introduce myself  shawn spencer psychic detective  im here to talk to you about a couple of your customers  namely carl and ted  well i hope its about those two bums paying me the money they owe me  its going to be tough for ted to pay you back  seeing as how hes dead and everything  when did this happen  last night  as if you didnt already know  come on frank i know the game  somebody loses big they cant come up with the cash  you got to send a little message  isnt that the code  theres a bigger code than that  dead men dont pay back debts  injured men do  so im not your guy  besides  theres a bar room full of witnesses that can vouch for my whereabouts last night  now  if youll excuse me  a paying customer has just arrived  fine  thats weird  mrs g  what in the world are you doing here  do you know what this guy does  oh this is so embarrassing  um shawn  ive recently made the first and

knows someone who knows someone who knows frank  i already told you this frank  i wasnt listening  anyway it all seemed like fate at the time  until i lost  oh oh i felt terrible  and i learned a valuable lesson about the perils of gambling  long story short  i lost my christmas money  shawn  you have to promise not to tell my husband  i dont want him to know about my secret vice  oh mrs g  first of all one time is not a vice  it was a momentary lapse in judgment  maybe a jones   secondly i am psychically detecting that mr guster  will not be angry with you for keeping a secret from the family  hell understand  what are you guys doing up  its barely light outside  have a seat dear  christmas at my house never starts til after the football game  well youre just in time to open

working the night shift i didnt have time  i have been cooking cleaning getting the house ready ive been swamped  im not going to lie  honey i made a horrible mistake  i know how you feel about

actually shawn and i do   no we dont  yes we do   no we dont  please no  we had a romantic tryst ten years ago  just a little something something  but with everyones blessing we would like  to pick up where we left off  you fooled around with my sister  please dont say fooled around  that makes it sound so dirty  one time ten years ago you were off at college  just because im not here doesnt make her not my sister  or our baby girl  point of information im not a baby  what happened to all the love and forgiveness from just a second ago  my mistake wasnt this bad  wait a minute wait a minute

shawn  yeah yeah shrimp i got it  im coming im coming  hey dad merry christmas  hey shawn i thought you were staying over at the gusters  yeah well i kind of sort of ruined christmas at that house  whatd you do this time  gus sister and i sort of hooked up a while back and  for some unknown reason she announced it to the whole family  and now gus is pissed  and hes kicking people out  yeah well fooling around with your best friends sister  certainly wasnt your most brilliant idea  no that was the toaster alarm i invented in the third grade  that woke you up by smacking you in the face with a waffle  i think i peaked too soon  look shawn of course gus is going to overreact  hes more than just your friend hes your partner  theres a special kind of trust there  when you find out that youve been lied to by your partner  you get angry  i saw it on the force all the time  we scammed people all up and down the coast  dad thats it  thats it  i bet carl and ted have another partner  what carl and ted how many relatives do the gusters have  i got to go i have a break in the case  wait   merry christmas  wheres the shrimp  yeah yeah  im sorry for taking you away from your family on christmas jules  oh its fine  wheres gus  we had a fight  he totally overreacted  back in the day his sister and i had this teenie weenie little  fling  youre going to take his side i cant believe this  im just saying its a little inappropriate  dont worry it was way before i knew you  why would that matter   it might  it doesnt   it could  it wont  lets carry on  so i pulled all of carl and teds court records  from across the state like you said  your psychic sense about them was right  look at this  ten years ago in fresno carl and ted turned states evidence  in an assault and robbery case  they implicated someone named moncrieff johnson  see i knew i had heard that name before  but i thought it was the black quarterback  that replaced woody harrelson in wildcats  and then i rembered  he was the guy who  was knocked unconscious in the fight at the mall  it was the same fight carl was involved in  and guess what else  he was released from the hospital  the same day that teds body was found at the mall  we never physically hurt anyone that wasnt our thing  whoa whoa whoa  im getting something here  carl and ted turned states evidence  because he started using violence which wasnt their m o  moncrieff wasnt an innocent victim in the fight at the mall  he started it  carl didnt realize he had gotten out of prison and was hunting him down  but the krav maga expert knocked him out before he could get to carl  when moncrieff got out of the hospital he picked up right where he left off  only this time he didnt rely on his fists  hes probably going to make his move before carl can get away again  you call lassie i have to warn carl  moncrieff johnson youre under arrest for the murder of theodore meltregger  and the attempted murder of carl wilcox  i think you made the naughty list   congratulations shawn we got him  thanks for believing me this time man  thanks for saving my daddy  all right folks lets clear the area  all right you guys can come with me  hey man  look im not a parent or an uncle  or even a godfather  i think children are sticky  but look one things for certain  and thats that brittany is a very smart little girl  but shes not going to be little for long  when these times are gone shell be out there making her own choices  i mean do you really think  that youre teaching her to make the right choices  please dont im a grown man  shes right over there  carl  thank you  oh here comes your dad   daddy  come on come on lets go home  what do you want  i feel uh  good enough for me come on in  what is going on here  when i left you guys were furious with each other  we stayed that way for a while but we got over it  like we always do  you see see its not the first time that we got mad  because one of us did something stupid  and it wont be the last  our rule is you can get as mad as you like  as long as you spend the same amount of energy working it out after  it took a lot of energy to work out how we felt about  the secret the two of you were keeping  but they got over it  then we realized you frustrated us  the way only family can so  we decided to forgive you too   thanks man  merry christmas  oh and as far as your sleeping arrangements  well you dont have to go home  but you got to get the hell up out of here   i hear that  believe that  gotcha  merry christmas though  merry christmas  merry christmas  merry christmas  hey  oh hey hey shawn  just came by to drop off your gift  what happened to your lodge buddies  oh i made the mistake of telling singleton his wife was getting hippy  just a joke i didnt mean anything by it  but tempers started to flare and the next thing you know  the room is divided into two camps hippy and not hippy   needless to say it was time for me to send everybodys ass home  im really sorry to hear that pop  no worries  because we still have our tradition to do right  and my winning streak is about to be extended  oh my  did we get each other the same  no  you see i figured youd pull a stunt like this  so mine is just a decoy  your real present  youre so predictable  which is why i hid your real present  now this is just uncanny  you better not have gotten me the same iphone i got you  dont be ridiculous  i got you the psych iphone skin  but silly me you dont have an iphone  so ill just keep it for my new one  and my winning streak continues  merry christmas
