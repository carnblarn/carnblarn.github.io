for something with flippers  the ocean  is a little smaller today  with the loss of this  inspirational guy  is that randy labayda  dude  they got randy labayda from animal planet  if sea creatures could cry  their tears would cause  their tears would cause the water level of all the oceans of the world  to rise an alarming 212 inches  but shabby would want us to rejoice  i was the last person to see him alive  and some people think i crazy to believe this but  as he returned to his home  sweet mother ocean  i thought i actually saw him  wink at me  just how famous was this sea lion  hes the big local story of the year  he was rescued by the aquarium people shawn  remember  floating on that loose raft  then he died tragically after being released out into the wild  come and grieve  its a poignant story and i need you to support me in my time of need  you have got to be kidding me  this is an open casket  shabby  you almost made it  but you touched our hearts  and our souls  be free swimming in the ocean of heaven  where there are no natural predators  good speech  your turn  are you kidding me  shabby  buddy  you lived a full life  i guess  uh you probably balanced a beach ball on your nose  at some point  maybe honked a horn with your mouth  barked the melody of grand old flag  clearly you  ate very well  oh no  oh no what  i think this sea lion was murdered  www substeam tv presents  synch by safes  psych  so3e10 six feet under the sea  why do you hate me  i dont hate you  i am telling you theres something unnatural going on here  we should go back to the aquarium and check out shabbys cage or something  he wasnt in an exhibit he was in the ocean  he was released back into the wild three days ago  gentlemen  i gonna need to see you for a moment  great

do you ask that  because i have seen some suspicious things at that aquarium  we cant talk here   is there somewhere we can meet  yes  dude what are you doing  cleaning up   but why  this place is a mess  and its not all the time that we have  an attractive conservationist come by the office  oh and by the way  i call her  what do you mean you call her  you cant call a person  why not  because i already called her at the funeral  you did not  she touched me gus  thats because you bumped into her  doesnt matter  contact is contact  its the rule buddy  you know what  get ready for battle  get ready for battle   come on  yup  this is ridiculous  we cant go to battle over a girl we dont know  il back off  youll back off  why  because this is silly  look you do your thing you work it and il stay out of the way  you think i cant get a girl on my own  fine il back off   i already backed off  too bad  backed off what  well i was in charge of shabby rehabilitation and  a lot of unexplained things happened  first of all they moved up the date of his release  by six days  and  why did they do that  well um  randy labayda  randy labayda  from the funeral  and  and pacific ocean aqua patrol yeah  i used to watch that show after wrestling practice in high school  i was the captain  yeah um  the aquarium  did a personal appearance deal with him a couple months ago  put him on the ads  build a randy labayda manta ray tank   what  and  someone wanted him to be the one to release shabby  and you didnt want that to happen  well no it was too soon  of course  labayda shanghaied the whole thing  it was supposed to be a quiet release  with a local photographer  i got to the dock  the photographer had been canceled  and i wasnt even allowed on the boat  no aquarium staff whatsoever  and i never got to see him again  that is so awful  so uh  what happened out on the boat  no one knows  everyone got back late and a little upset  then they locked up the ships log in labaydas office at the aquarium  april were going to need to get into that office so that i can feel things  i can get you in  how soon  tonight  are you wearing sweatpants  these are my sneaking around pants  dont be jealous i got you a matching pair  youre dressing up for her  dressing up dude i wearing sweats and  this ridiculous lime green jacket  thats my lime green jacket shawn  and its only for players  okay look i backed off you need to get over it  okay  this is it  what is there like a hidden door in the rock wall  no  you said you can get us in  yeah i uh  i can give you a boost  the electrified security fence is broken here  unless they fixed it  you dont work here  well technically no  i did until tuesday  i was asking too many questions  and labaydas producer tim had me canned  which is why i asked for your help  you want us to scale a wall  is it too high  oh no no  i could probably free jump it if the ground wasnt so wet   you could not  i could vault it   where would you land  okay listen  theres a door right on the other side of this wall  itll lead you straight towards labaydas office  the code is 1842  if i wrong  you can just leave  if it doesnt work  were probably going to jail  yeah  whos first  come on  see shes legit  legit  she just boosted us over a wall  she does have very impressive strength for a girl her size  okay  coolest office ever  hello  whats this  wait a minute  dude  he has two laptops  why lock up this laptop over that one  why does this have a gaps on it  its the only software on this computer  and its not picking up anything  can we stop playing with this guys computer  and get to the ships log please  yeah knock yourself out  this is all wrong  they were supposed to release shabby near san miguel island  okay  where they let him

business here  and a date with destiny  no no  you are not swimming with the dolphins  when are we gonna have another chance gus   come on  i dont care shawn  i in i on i out  hopefully they have a

and entering  it was really just entering  climbing and entering  we had the code  is that a backstage pass  and a dolce jacket  i have third row center at phil collins tonight  and i get called back here  because my department psychic wanted to break into an aquarium  to feed some fish  that is not entirely true  then why were you wearing swim trunks  carrying a how to ride a dolphin pamphlet

did it  yeah um i couldnt let you guys take the fall for me  i sorry miss you broke into the santa barbara aquarium  yeah well um  i led them to believe that i was still an employee at the aquarium  i got them the code for the alarm and got them into the facility  she was also able to inexplicably lift us over a security wall   yeah  chief she has good reason  she was actually acting heroically   thank you juliet  no thank you  and i like those earrings  chief there may have been a murder  i cant believe poor shabby is dead  you too jules  shawn the shabbycam is my screensaver  we can all learn from him  wait whos shabby   you dont want to know  i dont  yeah probably not  just know i am taking lead on this case  there is a crime at play trust me  i will straighten out these aquarium

need a name  i rather not  listen you guys dont know what ie been through these last couple weeks  i chased down a group of diamond smugglers  congratulations  not exactly i chased them to an airport where a plane was waiting  wait  what does rocinante mean to you  a fullbody syrah  a gay couple from lisbon  no it was the name of their plane  flew off into a lightening storm i wanted to chase them  but apparently our helicopters only fly  when theres rainbows in the sky  so they got away clean which  i officially jackass number one around here  i need a case  give me the victims name   shabby

these things before  okay thats fair  are there any signs of uh i dont know foul play  well a couple things are odd  i found a strange empty piercing  maybe he started swimming with the wrong crowd  you didnt happen to find any tattoos did you  carlton  i found some flat reef coral in the fur  hows that possible  yeah coral in the ocean  are you really asking that question  a sea lion is a precision animal  it knows how to swim around a reef without thrashing into it  thats true  and i found some synthetic fibers  okay what kind of fibers  monofilament line the kind found in fishing nets  all right ie heard enough  close this thing up lets go oara  lassie youre not being very helpful right now  really well let me see if i can close this case for you right now  now i no expert but let me take a shot  youve got a sea lion and youve got a net  and youve got the ocean you put them all together  case closed  what  i worried he might be right   are you serious  i dont know gus  we definitely need to see that reef  and i know how we can get out there  all right thats it thats it your hands are at 1000 and 200  down there thats your trim tab  over there your heat gauge  thats your fish finder gps  uses waypoints just like in a car  when you find a place you like  look at that you got a little microwave in there  shawn please focus look forward  do not become complacent just because its water  dad were still in the dock  look shawn do you want to drive this thing or not  i never asked that isnt that right gus  yeah i gonna get in the middle of that  man i just wanted to come see your new boat   go out onto the reef  the reef  i not going out on the reef that place is restricted waters  what if i told you it was for a case  well that would make it worse  but what if he didnt  we wont tell anyone okay we totally promise  plus well totally solve a crime  shawn would you please listen to me i not going out onto the reef  that place is offlimits to people  i not gonna lose my boat i not gonna lose my license  to follow some stupid lameass hunch of yours  youre really not going to budge on this  what do you think   told you  all right all right i do  i want to learn how to drive  you know what shawn hold up a second  i gonna grab my tackle box  shawn shawn  shawn  dont worry its cool  what are you doing  get back here  hes gonna come after us  nah he cant

that with the whole  shawn shawn let me show you how to drive  i think he wanted to show you how to drive  yeah so i could steal it later  this thing is all numbers its very hard to read  maybe its upside down  first of all shawn thats a thomas guide  ah thought it was a little landheavy  but look i think the reef is down here in the corner a7  did you listen to anything your dad said  the map is the screen  gus dont be exactly half of an 11pound black forest ham  thats clearly the gps  exactly its latitude and longitude  you follow the degrees  oh yeah  that what those numbers with the little quotation marks are  yes  dude i think i know where it may have gone down  that laptop was probably tracking labaydas boat  here here punch this in   one of those little lines that i would use to uh  to make a winking face in a text  no go back go back go back  it should be the left eye thats winking not the right  no gus pretend the person doesnt even have a right eye  like no ocular socket whatsoever  it was sutured shut from birth  shawn i got it  yes thats it right there thats good okay  now 50 degrees  come on buddy  two degrees to the right  no up  two degrees up what do those two little dots mean again   kick out the lights  oh dude were getting close   were like right on top of it  kick out the lights  why am i gonna kick out the lights  i think i see another boat out in the distance   wheres another boat  it doesnt matter where shawn  were in restricted waters i cant get arrested twice in the same week  you might have a few arrests in you but i dont  okay fine  did you hear something  like what  like  voices   take him  what  i had this dream before shawn  ever since we saw dead calm you have to take one for the team   what are you talking about  take one for the team  no ones gonna hurt us  hey guys  these are restricted waters what the heck are you doing out here  ahoy there  uh yes right  uh my name is shawn spencer  this is my first mate hummingbird saltalamaccia  hello  we were turned around  discombobulated  we just now realized that we were in restricted waters  just now  and we both have hepatic  i also couldnt help but notice you are not the coast guard  no no we thought you were the coast guard coming to tow us in   us  yeah  no no  but does that mean that theyre coming  and if so do you have an eta  no no idea we just weve been uh drifting for about an hour  we stalled on our way to monterey  ah old mehico  monterey mexico is  up north  so what are you guys doing out here  oh you know  just uh hiding from sharks  you know we heard that they can see you if your lights are on  so we kicked ours off  uh thats not how sharks work at all  regular sharks  of course right but  we heard there was an infestation of geneticallyaltered sharklike beasts  here in this area of the water  they can smell the light   they also type  true  what  not well but theyre sharks  with fins so its still impressive  oh and um how long did you say before the coast guard gets here  theyre not just right around the corner or anything are they  i telling you gus theres something wrong with those guys  did you want to stay out there and chat it up with them  no but we may not be the only ones out there looking for the sea lions killer  maybe he didnt want me to take the boat  i jumping out here  okay but youre gonna get wet  i cant believe this shawn  i gonna get arrested two times in one week  okay dad we have to come up with a system for unspoken actions  i cant believe you called the cops  i didnt call them shawn  they called me   why  coroner finished his inquiry  he found a bullet inside the sea lion  two 22 slugs actually  he was shot  he was murdered  so am i going to need a lawyer cause  mines on a boat off cape horn  it might take a while  mr labayda would you remove that bird from your shoulder  oh this is an australian hissing owl  and i have to do a show with him in about  three hours if i havent bonded with him by then  he will spend the entire shoot crapping all over my ed hardy tee  now  i would appreciate it if you would watch your tone  because this things like a sponge  and he can get really aggressive when things  get tense  detective telephone  i in the middle of something  its the fbi  again would you tell them  i didnt know they were smugglers until it was too late  and tell them if i had access to my own plane i could follow the rocinante  into the storm  maybe you should tell them yourself  right  didnt i have her fired  oh is that your source  no  mr labayda our source is the court  as in a courtsanctioned search we did of your office  we found a piece animal tracking software on your computer  we dont tag our animals randy  once theyre released into the wild theyre free  perhaps youd like to explain  i need someone to take the bird  all right  we were gonna track him  but it was such a great heartwarming local story  it would have been a great national one  i mean you cant blame me for  wanting the people to know what happened to this  special creature  yeah well  we need to know why you released him ten miles away  from where you were supposed to  i uh  think i like to make my phone call now  yeah i bet you would  labaydas sea adventure  burn the disks  is this you boss  destroy the footage  take a vacation in mexico for at least a week can you do that  i cant get to the footage right now chief  why not  because your two hair analysts are reviewing it right now  i  i dont have a hair analyst  who set that up  oh crap  get over there now  hair analyst  that worked  ie always dreamed of having one myself  i need the sunset perfectly framing  the silhouette  it has to be me and the wild  all right let me just say  you see a single strand of my hair out of place  let me know we cut right then and there  and that includes chest hair   timmy you got me you got me  yeah i got it  all right here we go  all right three   what  freighter freighter  what  no  no get out of the way  get your big polluting ass out of my shot  how many boats are there gonna be  okay rock blocks it perfectly  i guess thisll just have to do  i dont like it  i want to go on record saying i dont like it  hey gus hes not a murderer  hes just an egomaniac  and for fairly good reason his hair is spectacular  swim  swim my friend  he released shabby in the wrong place to get a better shot  that means shabby was just in the wrong place at the wrong time  arrivederci  my furry little michael phelps  arrivederci  he didnt shoot him  he didnt do it  yeah pumas are pretty mean  i know one time i ran into a puma  gus look at that  thats the same boat we saw  its the same guys  it was five days ago  weve been drifting for about an hour  we stalled on our way to monterey  they werent on their way to monterey  they were on their way to the reef  the reef where shabby went off the grid  why would they be going out there at night  guys  out of there  plan a or plan b  b  oh my god i killed him  shawn you cant steal your dads boat for a second time  gus you dont understand  my dad wants me to do this  do i shawn  you were really good with him  so were you you really scared him  and the bird  listen  i dont know if this is the right time to ask but  what about shawn  what about him  i dont know  something  intriguing  you know odd  its refreshing  i was thinking of letting him know that i uh available  you know and all that  what do you think  well i  dont know  is there a problem  no no theres no problem  your dads getting pretty good  too good i think hes been waiting in there since thursday  its pretty creepy and mildly impressive  gus  opportunity  dude theyre going that way we gonna follow them or not  uh i definitely a not right now  they might be coming back  theyre walking in the opposite direction  i think this is our best opportunity  theyre going to get help  theyre unloading stuff   barnacle bill  what  shawn  you wanna be hawkeye or crows nest  what do either of those mean  i dont know i was hoping you did  what is all this stuff  gps radar sonar electronic pulse sensors  hightech stuff  thats how they knew we were in the water  whatever they were doing they didnt wanna be found  and they were doing it at night  its just a bunch of salvage equipment  wait a minute  we need to get this thing off  what are we looking for  this thing this thing this thing  here let me do it i was a navy scout  this is a satellite tracking tag  whats it for  they use it for tagging animals training research  a couple of things are odd  i found a strange empty piercing  why does this have a gps on it  labayda was tracking the sea lion  he found a bullet inside the sea lion  two 22 slugs actually  they killed him shawn  why  we should go   theyre coming  quick jump in the water   theyre gonna see us  okay hang from the anchor   where is the anchor  that only works in cartoons  is there a shark cage  how could that possibly be a good idea  i dont know at least i coming up with some ideas  i telling you i saw someone on the boat i swear  its fine  theres no one everythings fine  i saw something i telling you  youre paranoid man  were in the home stretch here lets go push off  i on it check and push off  dude this is like  out of sight but super gay  dont touch me shawn  wait wait  you hear that  hear what  all

ok wait what whats so important   i just got a text from shawn spencer  and whatd it say  it says that he solved the crime and  and what  hes trapped in the hull of a smugglers boat going out to sea  what do we do with that  how can we find   okay now type the letter u instead of you   and you dont need that punctuation its just faster  chief  dude i really do feel so clooney right now  i am not jennifer lopez  that was a compliment  how is that possibly a compliment  did you see el cantante  she was amazing  shawn  shabbys transmitter  hold on  get off me shawn get off me  come on  ooh ooh i

elastic on my sock is  i not scratching your leg shawn  can you give us a general location of the boat  well its a little bit problematic  well i have my sister on ready with the coast guard  just give us the coordinates  thats the problem  we have a very definitive location it just doesnt seem to make any sense  how far out are they  first street and main  juliet wants me to check outside  you are not doing that  she says we may not be where we think we are  i trust her gus i gonna do it  shawn  shawn  gus  change of plans  lets do this quick i got the diamonds  we lose the equipment as fast as we can  what the hell  wait a second this is not my boat  my bad  gus i told you  our boat is called just chillin   oh yeah  just chillin  inexcusable  uh were sorry and well be on our way  sorry you had to be here  apology accepted  get down  down  around this way come on  towards the truck  now what the hells going on here  all right guys i just gonna be honest  cause thats usually the best policy right   i a psychic  youre a psychic  yeah  so i know you guys werent really on your way to monterey  and i know you werent stranded  in fact you were on a desperate search for the wreckage of the rocaninante  that was nowhere near close  i really hate that you said that  do we shoot them   i dont know yet  you dont know yet  well um il tell you what else i know  you found your wreckage from a plane that everyone assumed escaped  but actually went down in restricted waters  which is why your booty was so tough to find   you a cop  we are not cops  no but if i was a cop i be a bad cop  that much i know  not because i tough or unscrupulous  because of lateness just general tardiness  would you stop moving  get over here whats the point of this  unfortunately  a sweet sea lion named shabby  was innocently looking for a fish  or a squid to eat  what the hells the point of this  the point is you saw the signal coming  i got a hot signal coming  is it a boat  no could be a diver though  you thought youd been had so  you fired into the water thinking it was a diver but no  i got it whatever it was  sweet innocent sea lion  attached to a beeper by a television host on the sly  hoping to exploit his story for a comeback  and when you tried to pull him out of the water he managed to break free  why because he was a winner  and a very strong swimmer   and a survivor  thats right at least  at least for a couple of hours he was  youre here because of a sea lion  i here for all the sea lions jack  and the fish  and that stuff that looks like coral but moves when you touch it   gus what am i talking about  sea amenones   sea anemonene  dont do this to yourself   sea anemones  yes  yeah well its too bad you cant do anything with all that information   isnt it now  yeah  except that shabby left a little something behind  and ie been doing something i like to call stalling   and rutger hauer calls  schtalling   why  because hes dutch  no why are you stalling  because of that  put it down   dont move  drop it  saving your ass again spencer  lassie  i believe youll find that whatever your missing smugglers had  is in that truck over there  diamonds  perhaps in the boat  what are you talking about  i helping you i told you its a twoway street   hold on how did you  little bit of this  and a whole lot of that   hey  hi  the case is finished but i still have to do a little uh paperwork  thats all i doing here  but look at you look at you  yeah first day back  they even offered me labaydas office  i said no   really  thats the worst decision anyones ever made  yeah  listen shawn um i asked them for you  but they dont really allow people to ride dolphins  but we could arrange an interaction  that would be easy  yeah  no no thats okay  i gonna wait  wait until its natural organic happens in the wild  uh thats illegal  what if what if i ride a whale  i mean what if i do the same thing but with a whale   thats a joke  of course   of course it is  okay yeah ding  well listen anything else i can do please  you really are amazing  how about dinner you and me  a very dark restaurant il bring some candles  in case its too dark  thats something i like to do  listen shawn  i um   i really would love to  sweet  uh but  i dont want to get in the way  get in the way  yeah  i like her  and i think you two will get there  so thanks for everything  what does that even mean  good luck shawn
