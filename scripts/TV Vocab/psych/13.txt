sharing stick  dude get out of there  i have no choice i hate the stupid sharing stick  but i couldnt get out of this even if i wanted to  ive taken care of that allready  burton  why havent you painted yourself green   were all painting ourselves green its an envyretention thing  excuse me   oh it doesnt matter now   i just heard about your grandmother  my grandmother   slipped in the tub broken hip  go square her away and get back here as soon as you can  well at least we wont forget what she looks like  my daughter definitely liked having her photo taken  i think its what she liked most about winning  photography was her hobby too  but we dont have a lot of time for hobbies  you keep a security camera in her room  that guy felix alvarez the one the cops are looking for now  after he broke in we beefed up security  i remember reading about that breakin here   it must have been traumatic for her  yeah  it felt like she never got back to her former self as a player  mr sirtis  the spirits can be  bashful  sometimes grumpy  sleepy   dopey sneezy  shawn shawn  what im saying is  they wont talk to me unless no one is in the room except myself and my compatriot  thats me  that includes security cameras  ill get it turned off  thank you sir  thank you  cameras in her room   can you say control freak  can you say typical sports dad   what   these diamonds pretty much nail the four cs  i bet theyre from daddy  yeah  except for this one  look  this is way too cheap  you see how the gold chips off when you slide it around   this is from somebody else  somebody whos not loaded  this is an eternity ring youre supposed to wear this all the time  and its usually given to you by someone you know intimate  why do you know that   i gave one to jessica chan  ah yes jessica chan and how long was eternity for the two of you   three months but they were awesome months  except for the end part  right id never seen a girl lie about entering the witness protection program  she wasnt lying shawn  gus i saw her at starbucks  you cant be sure of that  she was wearing a name tag  she had a plaque on the wall  employee of the month her hobbies were hiding and  lying about hiding  fine whatever drop it  my point is why isnt deanna wearing hers all the time   she clearly has someone daddy doesnt approve of  we find the mystery lover  we find her  dude why dont i ever get to say stuff like that   all right get her down to the station take her statement  nail down the last time she saw deanna  im on my way in now  im sensing youre drinking a  nonfat vanilla  halfcaf with lots of whipped cream but without your usual pink straw  what are you two stalking me now   or did you come to tell me where the missing girl is   no  but i did divine that deanna has a secret boyfriend which sounds like a lead to me  yeah were looking into all her relationships  but you see its my job to investigate people with things like you know  motive means and opportunity  stop following me  what did i say   look man ive been meaning to have the same conversation with you about leading me  to be honest im sick of it  we either walk side by side or not at all  shawn six months ago i called you up as or not you wanted any of this junk  how come you only call me to come pick up stuff   you didnt listen now im donating all of it to goodwill  im on my way there right now so youve got about 30 seconds  last looks  no no no  you cannot throw out my whitesnake tshirt  you cant get this in stores anymore  wait a second  this is my airwolf windbreaker  ive been looking for this for like five years now  why did you take this  i never even saw you wear it  of course i didnt wear it i took it so you wouldnt  dont put it on  gus nobody had an airwolf jacket except janmichael vincent  this looks like a custom sakhart graphite rod and reel  thats right  good eye you cant throw something like this away  its 15 years old   well thats because its never been used  bought it for him  man i have been itching to get out on the blue and hook some snapper  but you know what a chore it is to get the boat and  youre welcome to come with me tomorrow morning  boat leaves at 500 am sharp  princess here  never could get him up  look the american medical association clearly states   that the proper amount of sleep  well  if youre sure you dont mind a little company  if youre sure you can be there at 500 am  ill be on the docks at 415  spencer  what just happened here   i think your dad just made his first playdate  its not funny  it is  he gave away my  custom somethingsomething pole  i loved that thing  we going to get it back   no we are going to the vista rica health and racquet club  now is not the time for a steam shawn  gus deanna was seen practicing there the morning she disappeared  she probably goes there a lot if shes some sort of tennis star  maybe someone saw her with her mystery lover  how did that sound   it feels like youre pushing youre pressing  deannas coach is in tokyo  but the manager said this girl was here practicing the last time deanna was  sweet  excuse me can we talk to you for a second   i only have 11 minutes left to practice  yeah but isnt it better if someones over there to return your serve   you play   no but this is vernest lambert watkins  he was a junior champion of some junior league  what did you guys call yourselves  the little green fuzzy men   the yellow hornets  but that was like 10 years ago  hell give you a workout  were just going to have a chat  racquets over here   now i can sense  you were here the day deanna disappeared  everybody knows we hit together what are you a genius   actually im a psychic  and i dont think i like your tone  let me rephrase that and dont read anything into my tone  why do you think she didnt show up to that tournament in tokyo   out  out  out my ass   you cant be serious  that ball was clearly on the line   long long by a hair buddy  any ideas  you know what her weakness was   kittens  focus  all she thought about was boys  cowboy up there buddy   shut up   any boys in particular   she was not particular at all  but i heard she started hanging out with that doug lenmar  doug lenmar   hes one of the topranked players on the mens tour  he stinks no net game  her father totally freaked when he found out and told her to end it  then she tried to be all rebellious and stormed off the court  how grody of her  grody   grody to the max  grody with a spoon  come on work with me i dont know what the kids are saying these days  i dont remember anything else thats all i heard  well you hear a lot  coaches are more gossipy than housewives  just watch  in five years shell be knocked up and living in governmentassisted housing  its good to see the game hasnt hardened you  out  okay so we know she had a secret boyfriend  doug lenmar  but if he was in tokyo why wouldnt she go to see him   lets find out if he really is in tokyo  if so plan b she was boycrazy  theres got to be more than one dude in the mix  maybe shes not missing  maybe shes hiding  to keep her dad off her case but where would she hide   what  i have the urge to suddenly get my bunions buffed  shawn this is completely unnecessary  deanna was here we have to retrace her steps  and the paraffin wax dip  you know how flaky my knuckles get  two birds one stone  ive never felt so productive  and exactly how much information do you plan on getting from a manicurist  that cant speak english   none so far  hold on  dude  hurry up  she was here yesterday  check that out  gus youre going to smudge my gloss  she ordered nail protein solution  so she has weak peeling nails  no genius the billing address is her fathers place  but the delivery address is someplace else  nice focus gus  thank you  maybe youre ready to take on that little girl again  gus i feel good about this  shes going to be here  safe and sound  or not  all right i want to talk to her the minute she wakes up  if she wakes up  what happened here   this isnt a missing person case anymore  its attempted murder  man  even she gets to say stuff like that  thats more crappy jewelry  that means that the working class boyfriend has been here  hey arent you henry spencers kid   that i am  i took a sixweek course he taught at the academy  lucky you how was he   yeah that just about sums it up  you mind if we poke around a little  no  we do we mind quite a bit actually  you know what  scratch that  im going to let you guys stick around and see what real detectives do  sweet  just let us know when they arrive  deanna shared this place with another player on the tour so  her name wasnt on the lease but  lassiter found one of her close friends  apparently they met frequently at that indian restaurant  we canvassed the area with her photo and the owner of this building recognized her so  we opened the door and voila  voila  ohara come take a look at this  check this out  i think these were all taken inside this apartment  i think youre right   wait a second  what   i see something  i see  a trophy  but im out of place  ive been  kidnapped   there is a trophy missing from here and we know she suffered a blunt force trauma  possibly the weapon  good work ohara  ohara that was all us  i think your tutorial in police work is done now  goodbye  its cool  ive got everything we need  deanna is listed as critical but stable for now  shes touch and go for the next 48 hours  and is considered to be armed and dangerous  anyone with information as to the whereabouts of this man  gosh  finding deanna lit a fire under the department  lassiters been having these advisory alerts run 247  so let me get this straight  their theory  is that felix followed her to her hide away and showed his love by trying to kill her   not a terrible theory  lets review shall we  no forced entry  that means she either let the attacker in or he had a key  sounds like someone she was intimate with  now the toilet seat in her apartment was up  so we know there was a guy there recently  i doubt a killer stopped to use the little boys room  so lets assume the phantom boyfriend stopped by for a matinee  and there were two wine glasses missing from her set  so she probably shared a drink with him  and he grabbed the glasses which had his fingerprints on them as he beat  a discreet retreat  none of that points to felix  i got to get back to work  now  youre going to leave now when were up to our necks in intrigue   the case is almost closed  we have the girl shes still alive  the cops beat us let them have this one  how can you be so negative  easy i need face time with my boss  i already missed the pamper pole trust exercise  im uncomfortable with you even saying the words pamper pole  look every minute the cops spend looking for felix  the real attacker breathes easier  now we have got to convince them to start looking for other suspects  no  unless you can give us something more substantial mr spencer  were going to continue the manhunt for felix alvarez  manhunt   hey i can project tommy lee jones from the fugitive if youd like  i want a hard target search for every outhouse henhouse cathouse  waffle house house md   house of long shadows    what   crime scene photos detective  its about time were you on a break   dad  now what  i just stopped by to drop off this hat for mr lassiter so he can look the part  the next time we go out and catch us some snapper  thanks  the next time you go out and  isnt that my hat   what are you doing here   oh you know just interrupting an official briefing and being a general   pain in my ass  yeah well  try living with him for 17 years  excuse me  i have a killer to catch  good luck with that  and time  nicely done  excuse me one second  whatre you doing here   dude you turned off your cell phone  some might take that as a hint as in leave me alone  burton   youre not having visitors are you   you know my policy on visitors   hes not a visitor hes  jerry hathaway  i too work at central coast in the lab  yes i worked on the monothiohuxtable drug  its for pancakereactic function  pancreatic  actually no burton   it was pancake  really  yes there are properties in the batter that helped to stabilize the ions  we were working with  ive never heard of that project1  it was a great drug  but it caused headaches stomach aches toothaches  weight gain weight loss  balding  severe oily bowel discharge  and in very rare cases it made you pee fire  yeah so the higherups  shelved the project  much to my chagrin  i thought i knew all the lab guys  im surprised weve never met before  i dont make much of an impact on other human beings  its terrible for my selfesteem  in fact ive ive been here all weekend  and this is the first conversation ive had  and tom you should know that  nobody made me a nametag  you know what we say about that here  hello  hi tom  no i mean the motto of the weekend  hello  lop off the last letter and you got  what this weekend really is  stands for health esteem  life love openness  oh thats pretty keen tom  you know in the spirit of openness  ive always looked up to gus  hes everything i wish i was  do you think maybe we could work  on the next exercise together   no we cant do that  burton  i believe your friend is reaching out right now  i think you two would be perfect candidates  for the minefield  burton you have to keep your eyes closed  while your friend leads you through a series of obstacles  oh tom that sounds really bitchin  uh can i talk to him alone for a second   sure  oh great thanks  oh gosh   dude ive got bad news  what  deannas doctors say  shes showing signs of improvement  shawn in the health care community  we call that good news  given what we already know  does she know her attacker   yes  does that mean  when she wakes up she can id him  she ids him and the case is closed  wheres the downside  because if youre the bad guy  and you know your victim can wake up and point the finger at you  hell find her and finish her off  youre just not landing it  the point is  deannas life is in danger now more then ever  and she needs us  burton  is there a problem  yes tom im afraid there is  burtons grandmother just called  shes broken her hip  i thought you dealt with that issue already  the other side tore the mcl  she did it while trying to do her line dancing classes  why was an 87 years old woman with a broken hip  attending a line dancing class  attending  she was teaching it  you leave my grandson alone hes a good boy  oh yeah  then why did he run when he saw us coming  because you guys got my face plastered all over the tv  for something i didnt do man  im innocent  i dont even think about her anymore  yeah thats what all crazy stalkers say  stop  just   stop  hey what the hell  what are you doing get your hand off him  hes reading his guilt give him a second  homina homina homina homina  ricky enrique  geraldo menudo  richie  this man is true to his word  he is pure of heart  hes made  many mistakes in his past  dirty filthy mistakes  im not telling you anything you dont already know here  he didnt attack deanna  really  if hes so pure of heart  why did we find the trophy  that she was nearly bludgeoned to death within his car  the raven crows only at midnight  dusk is for the roosters cackle  what  jules thats your cue to cackle  shawn i dont have a cackle in my repertoire  well you called for this secret meeting  we should use code speak in case people are listening  its not secret  just away from prying eyes  so what do you propose  should we rent one of those pedal boats  that looks like a swan  we could  or  you could just take these  what is this  copies of the files on felix alvarez  why are you giving these to me  i talked to the kid his grandmother  and the courtordered psychiatrist  he had to see after breaking into deannas house  they all say the months of counseling paid off  he was rehabilitated  and he had a medical condition  that required dialysis  my great aunt needed dialysis  and she was always knockdown dragout  winterbear tired afterward  and his last appointment probably left him  way too winterbear tired to stalk and attack deanna  exactly  and just what did the police do  when you fed them this peculiar piece of info gristle  they spit it out  in fact they are so certain that he is the guy  theyve taken the 24 hour guard  off deannas hospital room  jules thats no good  you got to get security back on that door  the killer will come back hell try again  at the very least  her dad is always by her bedside  have you seen that dude  she needs more security  than a 60 year old in a tracksuit  look without protection  you might as well just send the killer invitation  saying hey come on back finish the job  i wonder if they make invitations for that  i dont see why not   you can send an evite for anything  this is true  lassiter thinks  its an inefficient use of manpower  ill see what i can divine  whats this  thats the rest of paperwork on felixs first breakin  i figured you need all this information  to do your psychic stuff  i can feel these two crimes  were not committed by the same person  but in order for your brothers in blue  to be wrong  were saying felix was framed  were saying it was somebody  who knew hed be targeted by the police  youre saying it  im stealthily lending an ear  im saying it was an excellent slamdunk frameup  this somebody was a pretty bad guy  yes  ugly on the inside  thought of every detail  a virtual   hunchbacked mastermind  shawn  just let me know what you find  remember psychic intuitions not going to help this guy  evidence will  oh and one more thing  roosters dont cackle  i beg your pardon  they cockadoodledoo   youre kidding  you did not    oh man  you like that paprika in there  that was tasty  you have got to be kidding me  shawn what are you doing here  i dont know  i guess i took a wrong turn  and ended up in the twilight zone  what the hells going on here  we caught us some lunch this morning  hooked em cooked em and ate em  how tribal of you  shawn never really was one for roughing it  we went camping once  found him curled up inside his sleeping bag  because a raccoon was hunting him  stalking me  the raccoon was stalking me dad  and i came to talk to you  alone  alrighty  so whats wrong  all right heres the thing  why is there a picture of lassiter  on your refrigerator  thats a picture of the fish  i didnt even know he was in there  what could you guys  possibly talk about out there  shawn that is the beauty part  nothing  he knows to sit there shut up and fish  what you think we sit out there  and we yap about you all day long  i cant really wrap my brain around any of it  all right so  whats so important  im working on a case  and i know that theyve arrested the wrong guy  what makes you so sure  the mo  this guy in custody  he trashes the girls house trashes it  then the apartment  where they find her  is practically sterile  im talking about a perfect crime scene  but i cannot find anything in these police reports  to back me up  right there you see right there  thats your first problem  what  the police reports  shawn a police report  is always from somebody elses  point of view  ive written them a ton of them myself  and one thing you cannot do  is take them as gospel  all right so lets run this again  youve been to both crime scenes right  right  well the first one was after the fact  but ive been to both places yeah  okay so  close your eyes  dad  i didnt come here to take a stupid test  cant we just talk as men  shawn would you trust your old man for once  just once  close your eyes  here we go  all right now i want you  to go back to the first crime scene  this poor girls house  what do you see  what do i see  her bed  tennis trophies  jewelry box  mostly nice jewelry  a wall of photos featuring her  come on keep going  keep going shawn what else  there is nothing else  the guy was there way before me  everything looks different now  okay okay now lets go  to the second crime scene  to this apartment  where she was found  can we stop on the way and get donuts  shawn focus  keep your eyes closed  what do you see  wait a minute  thank you dad  i have a crime scene to break into  i cant believe you pulled me out of my retreat  i can kiss my chances  of getting dr feelgood on my route goodbye  gus what time do you have  wheres your watch at  its a key tanning month    right  thats around the same time we were here before  so why are all these clocks wrong  dude  i need you to lay on the ground  pretend like youre deanna  im not pretending to be a woman  half beaten to death shawn  you know what  im starting to wonder  if you have serious trust issues with me   really  yes  first you wouldnt do the minefield  now you wont lay on the floor  and pretend to be an unconscious woman for me  whats going on with you  two words  airwolf windbreaker  okay  two more  airwolf  windbreaker  battleship  dude that was like a million years ago  im just saying  i never cheated again  now can we please just do this  what is the point of me pretending to be deanna  something here is weird okay  when i was with my dad i realized  that the shadows coming off those two lamps  were in the wrong spots  i think someone tampered with this crime scene  tamp who could do that  someone smart  someone experienced  which is why we need to recreate the scene  so that it is exactly the way it was   when the cops got here  all right fine  fine now in the landlords statement  he said the body was found here  in the supine position  so please if you will  sure just  tell me what supine means  gus supine  su  pine  you dont know what the word means do you  okay fine you win  mr vocabulary wins  mr vocab is the big winner tonight everybody  thank you no please please please  it means on your back  i knew that  no you didnt  okay  this is off  the lamp is in the same spot but the shadows arent  and something else is wrong  there are six pictures on this bookshelf  there are six pictures in this photo  what do you expect  seven  i clearly remember seven photos gus  there were two pictures on each shelf  and one shelf with one  thats seven  it was right here where this box is  can you remember whats in the missing photo  im not  sure  what the hells going on  nothing man  nothing  is that guy dead  damn it  now youve seen too much  i didnt see anything  yeah you did  youre in this just as deep as i am now  were going to have to work together  okay  i assume this building has an incinerator   yeah  okay  so we just have to chop up the body and   we put the limbs in little plastic baggies  the torso were going to have to melt down   with a blowtorch  okay ive heard enough  chop up his body  and then you wonder why i dont trust you  are we done yet  one last thing  hurry up shawn  shawn i left my retreat to solve a crime  not to order takeout  thats exactly what were doing  hi there  what time do you turn those lights on  at 500 for the beginning of the dinner crowd  never any earlier  for any reason whatsoever  its on a timer  what the hell is the point  i think i know who the killer is  one more question and this is absolutely critical  do your samosas come with that red onion chutney  i arraign felix today if hes smart hell just plead out  so next is  jiminy crickets what  hes sensing an anomaly in the spacetime continuum  its very serious  it can unravel the fabric of reality itself  weve been trailing it from across town  the distortion is near   bless you  thank you  its in the photos in the files  yes  the photos are lying  that is the anomaly  it was the distortion that prevented me  from diving dirty deannas attacker  but now  now i have a clear image  we already know who attacked her  hes right mr spencer  hes wrong  the bludgeoners close  follow me  yes no no  bludgeoner  what are you nuts he works for us  the photos  look at the photos  jules jules jules  whats going on with the lights in the background of the window  oh hes right  the lights in the restaurant are on in these photos  they were off when we found deanna  what this is crazy  why would i attack some woman ive never met before  never met didnt you photograph her house   when the felix guy broke in  yes  thats when you met her  dude  she liked meeting new people she liked to party  and she liked to have her photo taken  and guess who takes photos for a living  you  and it was nice and it was on  and you were giving it to her and she liked it until  she met somebody  who could afford to buy her nicer jewelry than you  she was on her way to see him in tokyo  you decided to confront her at her apartment  hey trophy  bam   and then you cleaned it all up  and you made it nice  and you left a perfect crime scene  and you came back here  and assumed your capacity as police photographer  you scrutinized the photos  making sure there was no trace of your presence  in that apartment  oversight  this bag  sure enough  in a photo on her bookshelf  your bag with your initials  that the police have seen a million times  theyd have known it was you so what did you do  you waited for the forensics guys to split  and you snuck back inside  oh you were so meticulous  you took the time to turn the clocks back to the right time  and you rephotographed the whole scene  without the incriminating photo  and you resubmitted those as the originals  but i can feel that you forgot  to reset the clocks to the correct time  before leaving  gus  take him into custody  until we figure this whole thing out  so  the prophecys been fulfilled  what what are you talking about  what prophecy  nothing  i just figured it was finally my chance  to say something dramatic  fire  hey pop  shawn god  what are you sleeping one off  no  i couldnt sleep last night  my backs all out of whack  hey i hear they   they arrested one of the forensics guys  yep  they grilled him like panini  he confessed to the whole thing  and the police found  a fake hospital badge at his apartment  they think he was going to try to kill her last night  hows the girl  the doctors say shes going to pull through  there he is  youre not going to go out like that are you  yeah  i cant make it tonight  ive got to work a double  i know  why dont you take junior here  ill catch you next week  what are you talking about  didnt you just work backtoback shifts  on that tennis thing  okay fine  you got me all right  hes actually capable  of taking all the fun out of fishing  he criticized my pole technique for like three hours  its holding a pole in the water   what is there to criticize  hey  ease up  thats my pop youre talking about  im beginning to understand you a little better spencer  burton youre back  sorry i missed todays program sir  well its okay  i tried out a new trust exercise  where i pull a rubber band back as far as i can  and i hold it up to my trust partners eye  and i say do you trust me do you trust me  wow how did that go  i wish my grip was better  but  the cornea is resilient  thats true tom  ive heard that  now  burton here hates to drag  his personal life into work matters  but i feel like you should know  his dear grandmother somehow managed  to dislocate both of her shoulders too  i think it was the chinups  she was trying to do on the traction bar  burton  you have missed almost every exercise  we had arranged for this weekend  you left a work function  to tend to your ailing grandmother  even if it was detrimental to your career  you know what that tells me  it tells me you really care about people   i do  he does  and after getting in touch with my feelings this weekend  i think thats exactly  what the central coast pharmaceutical company  is all about   yes  okay  and  burtons grandmothers going to need  a little extra caring after  he would never complain  because i know he loves this job  but if there was any way   that his route could be a little less  save your breath  burton  i know that everybody here wants to get dr magnotti  why dont you swap him out  for a couple of your less productive clients  oh wow wow  thank you tom  my grandmother thanks you as a matter of fact  well i tell you what  once shes feeling better  i want you two to come on over to my house  and have dinner with my wife and i  oh no  no we couldnt we couldnt  lizzy makes a fondue thatll
