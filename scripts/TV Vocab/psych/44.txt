                so thats it from thunderbird stadium  as quarterback sammy winslow and the tbirds  lose another heartbreaker  winslow was brilliant at times today  throwing for three touchdowns  but his two secondhalf interceptions were absolute backbreakers  this is the greatest moment of my whole life  hey you see being a cop has its advantages huh   this is pretty cool  oh there he comes  oh my god  i gotta get his autograph  hes so cool  just relax relax remember hes a person  just like me  oh no hes way better than you  hey  good game  uh great game sammy  but do you want to know why you threw that interception in the third quarter  why  well every time youre gonna throw a quick pass to the left side  you rub your hands together then pat the ball twice  which is probably why you threw those six picks in the last three games  or something i  i dont know  uh sorry hes a  perceptive little pain in the butt or something  sorry  you cant do that hes a quarterback  you cant tell him  kid  oh my god  my god  whoa we got the game ball  i got the game ball  where have you two been weve left you 12 messages  sorry we were having our biannual rae dawn chong movie marathon  did you see quest for fire  guys  the chief is not happy  you have to keep your cell phones on at all times  this would all be a lot easier  if you would just run with my genius psych signal idea   no  dont you mean yes  what are you talking about  its like the bat signal only way awesomer  the silhouette in the sky would be my hand to my head psychicstyle  i drew up a whole proposal  that would have cost the department 200000  we covered that with our bake sale alone  and whats going on with our badges  youre not getting badges   she has one  shes a cop  all right fine well settle for guns  its about time  come with me we may have a missing persons case  we need you to look into  may have that doesnt sound very definitive  do you have any leads  theres one  mr spencer we need you to psychically tell us  who belonged to this foot  does he know thats where they keep the bodies for identification  i think hes figuring that out right now  there you go  so what can you tell us  its weird  the lower extremities give off very very intense psychic vibes  for instance the pinky toe is telling me that he went to the market  im sorry thats wrong he uh  he actually stayed home  and something about  weewee and roast beef  okay i knew this was a waste of time  the foot was found by hikers this morning  on a trail near lake cachuma  mr spencer we have to assume that we were meant to find  this foot which means that were dealing with a psycho  im gonna position this case as a possible murder investigation  but i can only keep this foot thing quiet for a day or two  i dont want to panic the community  youre saying you think this thing might cause quite a stink  all right now i just feel like a heel  that was callous  wwwsubsteamtv presents  synch by safes  psych  s03e13 any given friday night at 10pm 9pm  oh hey yeah  had to bolt out of there  my cell phone was like literally shocking my leg  it must be the battery or something  i like that story  lets stick with it  you know there was something weird about the way the big toe was smushed  and the side of the foot was callused  not random almost symmetrical you know  like it had happened over time  it probably comes from some repeated action like kicking  or kicking  he could have been an athlete  like a soccer player  or a soccer player  sorry  it helps me think  google missing foot   that was your plan  not all of it  watch out watch out  rogue foot on the loose  i cant control it  its heeltoed down from the spirit world  to give me a swift kick in the ass and now  but now its channeling a message through my own foot  whats it saying  besides everyone cut loose  lets listen  something about the big toe the way it was smushed  callused as if it belonged to someone who  kicked things a lot   a prison guard  a rockette   a kangaroo  an athlete  yes an athlete perhaps a soccer player  soccer players wear shoes  the toe thing wouldnt happen unless the person was barefoot  again let me pitch kangaroo  what else do you have spencer  i mean do you have a name  are they in danger are they still alive  darn it vision gone  ill have to sit with this one  just get back to us when you have something and it better be quick  chief my middle name is quick  i changed it from boutrosghali  are you sure its vlad alexavic  think about it hes the only player in the league that kicks without his shoe  plus you said he had surgery on his ankle last year  yeah he jumped off of kathy griffins balcony on a dare  blew out his ankle missed the entire playoffs  that scar on the ankle was fresh  i dont know shawn  even for you thats a big leap  and what are we gonna do  just walk into a pro football training camp  and just start asking if anyones missing a foot  the words foolproof and plan do come to mind yes  what are you guys doing here  i was drawn here by a name  thats been kicking around my psychic third brain   vlad  vlad alexavic  the tbird kicker  yeah after you left i started thinking about the connection  between the big toe and an athlete  and then i realized vlad is the only kicker  who kicks without a shoe  jules  color me impressed  and purple with a streak of magenta  well ii dated a miami dolphin for a while one summer  oh yeah so youre  really attracted to big meatheaded football players  oh theyre not all meatheads  and i dont know its just  something about that uniform  yeah  so anyway  shawn and i thought that if we could get some information about vlad   its already done  and the team  we matched dna samples to the foot yesterday  its vlad  set hut  out round  dude can you believe this  were standing on the field of an actual pro football training camp  this is awesome  my dad would love this  yeah  too bad hes not talking to you  you should have just gone on the camping trip  ill make it up to him next week  ill head over there for dinner  bring him a pouch of big league chew  maybe watch a couple of episodes of the mentalist  itll be fine  dude  this is going to be the coolest case of all time  i should have brought my autograph book  ive been stuck on c everett koop and drew lachey for a while  i dont see what the big deal is  a bunch of guys in tights and hard hats  playing in the dirt  what  im not a big fan of football  what are you a fan of exactly  i dont know  the gun sports  what are we waiting for  to talk to sam winslow  hes the coach and general manager  are you kidding me we get to meet slingin sammy winslow   what  so  so hes one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of pro football  he also happens to be a very good friend of mine  you met him once when you were ten  and the only thing that my dad and i both like  besides asian slaw and harry hamlin  whos with me  whos with me on hamlin  literally  no one is with you  sammy won a championship his first season as a coach  but he hasnt even been to the playoffs in six years  it sounds like hes not a very good coach  come on you call that a twominute drill  i could get to dallas on my nephews big wheel faster than you ladies  its ridiculous  reset  its ridiculous  i see youre too tall to be an agent  you must be a shoe rep  no im a cop  we need to speak to you about one of your players  im detective lassiter this is my partner detective ohara  and these are  never mind  i dont want the press to see this  ill give you two minutes all right come with me  thank you  you found vlads foot  you sure its his  im afraid so  whens the last time you saw him  its been a few weeks  i mean he was a holdout  i mean vlads always been a bit of a free spirit  i mean hes disappeared during the offseason before  i just thought he was doing it again  were gonna need to speak with some of your players  wed appreciate it if you kept the information  about mr alexavic quiet for the time being  could someone have killed him  thats what were here to find out  i cant believe im saying this  but you two think you could have spoken up a little bit  sorry about that  its what happens to us when were in the presence of one of our heroes  gus almost fainted when we ran into ralph macchio at a del taco  for the record he was not working there  why dont we interview the players  and you guys take care of everything else  sure  heard you guys were asking questions about vlad  whats going on  its unclear at this point mr tompkins  its matt  look vlads one of my bros if theres a problem  i wanna know about it  if you have any information about vlad we could really use the help  well i dont want to start any rumors or anything but  i did hear that he owed a lot of money to people   what people  bookies i think  i also heard a rumor that he tried to start a night club with  some of his cousins and lost a sh  load of money  thatd be russian cousins  what do you think  great while you guys were goofing off we actually got a lead  matt tompkins told us that vlad lost a bunch of money  that belonged to some russian cousins  whatd you guys find  just this  whats that  vlads phone  we found it in his locker  you stole it  benji the locker room attendant let us in  big fan of rent told him gus was taye diggs  so he also gave us these old jerseys  how do i look jules  like my 11yearold nephew in his peyton manning pajamas  your 11yearold nephews ruggedly sexy   thats weird  whoa hang on  look at that  that is a direct threat  this plus the foot screams russian mob  really i dont hear anything  im just saying we found that phone awfully easy  and there just happens to be a threatening text on it come on  so you think someone planted it in his locker  no i think someone put it there on purpose  thats what i just said  mine wasnt in the form of a question so it comes from a place of power  im not gonna stand here and listen to this  and well be back with a search warrant for the contents of that locker  you see we actually follow police procedure  so what do we do now  benji said the only ones allowed in the locker room  are players and team personnel  the answer to what happened to vlad is not in some  russian bathhouse  no we need to get close to the team  are you saying we go undercover  im saying we assume alternate identies  so that we can get in there and investigate  without drawing any extra attention to ourselves  coach winslow sorry to bother you  its all right come in  you were with the cops earlier  you didnt say a word  no its because i was observing  my name is shawn spencer  im a psychic that works for the sbpd  this is my partner du quoin smallpox randolph  you can call him gus  we work on highprofile cases like this all the time  yeah well  this is my fault  i mean i knew that vlad was going off the rails and i didnt do anything  no no no coach please  dont beat yourself up  you you probably get this a lot but  but were huge fans of yours  i slept on your face for years  i mean i had sheets with you on them when i was a kid  and weve actually met before  i was the kid after the denver game who told you about your interceptions  oh yeah  i told you hed rember me  yeah  you know i didnt throw a pick the rest of the year  oh boy i thought id play football forever you know  sure as heck never thought id end up a coach  well  coach  im here because im sensing some very dark forces coming from your team  whoever did this to vlad  might want to harm other players as well  i think that we can help  how can you possibly help  red 17  red 17 check down  check down red   17 dragon  shawn   wildebeest  shawn  bevell came back too early from his concussion  hes afraid of getting hit  fletcher  well hes worrying about his divorce hes not focused on the game  dayne may seem heavy but its just water weight  hes actually gonna be fine  bollinger is freaking out because he thinks his wife might know  that hes sleeping with the reporter from channel five  and calderwood well hes just not cool with being demoted to second team  even if he says he is  yes no mean juiced possibly gay  definitely gay  that is incredible  i mean i already knew about dayne suspected kenny but  i mean that still thats impressive  so what is in this for you  well we just want to find whoever did this to vlad  help you get your team back  and maybe lead the team out of the tunnel one time before a game  that is not gonna happen  but you know i may need your help  but theres just one problem  i mean these guys are not gonna  just let somebody walk in off the street and get close to them  they have to think that you belong  all right lets get this done fast  weve got ten other spots to check today  they said the locker room guy has the key and hes on the field  all right i want to see all the kickers trying out  on the field right now  thats right its real  feel free to drink it in   some help  ok  so adam  vlad just came in here last year and beat you out for the job huh  yeah well  hes not here so its my job to win now  shanked that a little  i never heard of you before  you said you played in tampa  tel aviv  israeli arena league  didnt play on the sabbath so you probably didnt see me  ive also been out of the game for a little while  i had a couple of knee surgeries and this elbow  filled with ostrich cartilage  six   get out there and kick  yeah coach  did i see you give an interview to espn this morning  first of all  it was espndeportes  and it was an exclusive coach  you cant be giving interviews  youre a nonroster invitee  i told the docs you had an mcl tear  which means no kicking  youre here to solve a murder  no interviews no kicking solve the murder got it  all right lets go girls pick it up   my grandmother moves faster than that  all right  estevez estevez youre up  actually its emilio estevez esttevez  and i have a knee injury so i cant kick  if you aint gonna kick then get off this field  you saying i dont have a choice  no get out there  whats up  that was awesome  it was just a 21yarder  yeah well  i was in an iron lung a week ago  dude check the books  i think i just tied tom dempseys record for longest field goal  yeah no you didnt  his record is 63 yards not 63 feet  whats up in your world  look shawn we cant be wasting time  lassiters on his russian thing and we only have two days  to figure out what happened to vlad  two days  to fulfill 20 years of fantasies  thats what a team manager wears huh  im not a team manager  im a training intern  and ive been setting up massage tables for the last hour  you know what they do on those massage tables shawn  they play connect four  they massage men  big hairy men  look let me be very clear these hands are not touching anyone  i only use these hands to touch myself   let me rephrase that  please stop speaking  and no more fist bumps for the rest of the day  carlton we have been to every place even remotely connected to russia  and all of eastern europe and we have found nothing  we have to start looking someplace else  maybe theres something in this stuff from vlads locker  just a bunch of junk  what  well tompkins said he thought vlad was gambling right   yeah  these could be bets that he made  look it says miami plus six kc minus two  look at this  its a phone number  do you still have vlads phone records  yeah but they didnt show anything  the text vlad got was from a disposable phone  check this   that number called vlad twice last week  we got a lead lets go  while you were fooling around i was investigating  ever since the cops came everyones talking about vlad  what are they saying  none of the players liked that dude  he either owes them money  tried to sleep with their wives or called them out in the press   did i move it  no   not one nanometer  nanometer what is that  like two or three feet  i dont think everyone hated vlad check it out  he has one of those warriors towels in his locker too  they call themselves the warriors  because theyre the craziest guys on the team  matt tompkins vince garner and drew shacker are the leaders  man  now im gonna have to figure out a way to get close to those guys  that doesnt involve getting a lobotomy  or showering with strange men with volcano nipples  coach is crazy if he thinks im playing special teams this year  i get injured on a play there goes my bonus  exactly right  dude what are you doing  have you guys seen altered states  no  just got back from being a monkey  why did i think that would land  you scared the hell out of us bro  sorry bro  emilio estevez esttevez  new kicker  you mean like the actor guy  youre thinking of charlie sheen  what  actually youre probably not thinking of anything  nice ink  thanks man  yeah this is my wife  thats my mom  and thats the stripper i hook up with in vegas sometimes  very sweet  i dated a dancer once  destiny  real name was glitter  nothing there  so  whats up with your kicker vlad  some pretty crazy rumors floating around  i dont know what to tell you man  vlads kind of a loner  yeah we didnt really know him  i heard something about some russians  i hope its not that theyre coming  theyre coming  the russians  well  thats it for me  i  i gotta go get my steroids shot  whoops probably shouldnt have said that out loud  steer clear  might be some pee in that one  this is definitely the address  and theres a picture of vlad on the shelf  oh no  look at that  madam  why do you have that picture here  ooh im a huge fan of chad  one day i plan to have his baby  were detectives with the sped  were looking for any information you might have on vlad alexavic  oh jeez  go around back  get on your knees  hands on your head

what can you tell me about poison oak  what cant i tell you its the threeleaved devil  causes severe itching and a red bumpy rash  found only on the pacific coast and usually near bodies of fresh water  the foot was found by hikers this morning  on a trail near lake cachuma  come on  we gotta call the me and check something out  but i think i might know where vlads body is   how  calamine lotion  calamine lotion  all right thanks  you were right  the m e said the pink flakes under vlads toenails  were dried calamine lotion  and this is the closest lake to traing camp  cops obviously got my message  what are you doing  its game time  im about to blow their minds  how do i look  like an idiot  sweet  sorry im late  practice ran long  by the way jules you might want to jump on the spencer bandwagon  sign up for my newsletter maybe buy my fathead  spencer what are you doing here  its vlads body  its dark its murky  his voice is a little uh   warbly  thats right  like its calling to me from underwater  maybe a  a river or stream perhaps a  lake  yeah we pulled out vlads body an hour ago  mr spencer it looks like youre a little late to the game this time  what no witty retort  no reference to some obscure 80s film   ohara write this down  i dont have a pen  make note of the date and time that i carlton lassiter  actually shut shawn spencers cavernous piehole  sorry what was that  something about night of the comet  just just forget it  okay we need to expedite this  make it a top priority  we received a tip that vlad had been using  an old girlfriends cabin on the lake  when we went back and ran some of his credit cards  we found out that one was used at the cold spring gas station  on highway 154  yup and the attendant there said that hed rembered seeing vlad  three days ago and that he got into a car with several other men  which we assume is our russian connection  you see boys  at the end of the day  good oldfashioned police work always wins out  oldfashioned  so you went and billyclubbed some immigrants  you know jules its a shame you didnt see my kick at practice  yeah sorry i missed it  i didnt  ooh i almost forgot  just a little something to make this whole police thing official  isnt this the same thing you gave the former laotian general  who sells peanuts outside the station  yeah but his actually says detective on it  chief i need a favor  please dont release the info about finding vlads body yet  come on  give me one good reason  ill give you five  ill give you one  i know deep down in my psychic loins  that the russian angle is completely wrong  why because all signs point directly to it  exactly  whoever did this thinks they got away with it  we release the info now theyre just gonna run  give me one day  its gonna take us at least 24 hours to find and notify them in russia  that gives you one day  thank you chief  come on gus  oh lassie  your haircuts worse than joyce hysers in just one of the guys  thank you and good night  why isnt my dad picking up  probably because you were supposed to be at his house  three hours ago for your apology dinner  yeah well well have a late dinner  late its already 1000 shawn  way past curfew  were gonna get caught and you might end up losing your roster spot  why did we come back here  because the answer to what happened to vlad is with the team  the warriors lied about being friends with him  and drew referred to him in the past tense  yeah we didnt really know him  so the guys were with vlad at the lake but they lied about it  exactly  something went down i just dont know what or who else was there  what do we do now  be careful theres a coverup here  a lot of guys hated vlad anybody could be involved  you guys know why youre here  you have two choices  dude i think were on top of the stadium  do not step forward  you can either jump  or get pushed off  you have five seconds to decide  five  four  three  two  one  what do you think youre doing  enough already  its matt and vince  we might be screwed  dont be an idiot  you can blow this whole thing for all of us  were only trying to scare em coach is not gonna find out  hell yes he can  and there goes our contracts  you get these guys off this building and into their rooms now  all right  guys take the hoods off shows over  sorry about that guys  beer  what were you gonna do  haze us  its traing camp  you know it gets so intense you gotta cut loose a little  what was all that stuff with matt and vince about  you dont have guaranteed contracts so you dont have to worry about that  just dont tell coach what we did  all right  come on guys  oh gosh  dude  i got it  we need to talk to sammy he always works late  what about your dad  ill figure that out on the way  shawn youre not the person i want to see right now  i know i know and im sorry  im gonna make it up to you i promise  uh do you  do you still have that football  the thunderbirds football that i got when i was a kid  i dont know maybe up in the attic why  i want him to sign it  henry that steak was downright vicious baby  i mean thank you for having me over  i you know i dont rember the last time i had a homecooked meal  you kidding sammy winslow at my house  i should be thanking you  or you could thank me since i brought him over but  its neither here nor there  do you know that shawn and i used to sit in that living room right there  and watch every single one of your games you remember that shawn  remember i remember i had to stand next to the fridge  for the entire second half  of the playoff game against seattle in 88  because every time i got an otter pop  you threw a touchdown  he didnt want to jinx it   hey we won right  yes we did  i still cant believe that you let shawn talk you into this crazy plan  well you know the kid does have a way with words  i mean im not sure if hes a genius or if hes totally full of it  maybe hes a little bit of both  get us a couple more beers   you got it  thanks  you know i was thinking about retiring this year  but now  i cant go out like this  everything ive done before would just be forgotten  sammy if  if you found out that you had players that were hazing  what would you do about it  used to be i wouldnt do anything  but that all changed last year  when i put behavior clauses in everybodys contract  what do you mean  well we had so many guys getting in trouble off the field  you know getting arrested  driving their motorcycles through honeybaked ham stores stuff like that  so  i put a thing in everyones deal  that says if they get caught doing any of that stuff  that i can cut them  no exceptions  none  the only thing they respond to is fear  fear of losing their money  i think we should put that fear to work for us  good job boys  hold up  hold up  well vlads death is a horrible tragedy  were working with the santa barbara police department to  help in any way that we can  and we voted as a team to  continue to practice and to play  and that is what were going to do thank you  at least tell us who the kickers gonna be  thank you  you know i hope you know what youre doing kid  you got my career  hell you got my legacy in your hands  sammy  youre just gonna have to trust me okay  im gonna fix this  you didnt even look at the ball  you aint mad at it though  were four weeks from our first game  youre still pulling this come on baby  come on focus men  dude  matt and drew are getting into it  i think the pressures getting to them  where are your john stockton shorts  theyre not john stockton shorts shawn  i changed because i just got off the phone with juliet  she wants us to come down to the station right now  check this out according to her  vlad wasnt murdered  what  say that again  use a jamaican accent  me said vlad no murder the murder thing cant work  no man the mans feet   shawn  all right lets go  and according to the coroner vlads injuries  were more consistent  with those of a motor vehicle accident  well my psychic wires are crossed then  cause i can see vlads body  but i dont see any shards of glass or cuts on it anywhere  good catch im glad i called you  are you sure you didnt call me to see me in my uniform  cause i got a glimpse of myself in the mirror earlier and i was like whaat  i didnt know they made pads in extra small  hey  dead russian guy  possible homicidal football players  right sorry gus   where did this come from  theyre vlads  im getting something here  older republican walruses  no that doesnt make any sense everyone knows walruses are libertarian  off off off offlagen  off off rixper  off on off   shawn  offroad warriors  offroad like atv  you know what atvs dont have windshields  we have to go  all right i think i know what happened  but i need a little more proof  i dont understand the big deal about the time of death  it happened between 400 and  that text came in five hours after he already died  would you send a threatening text message to someone  hours after you supposedly killed them  you would if you were starting the coverup  what do you think youre gonna find in matt and vinces locker  something that ties them directly to vlad  looks like someone beat us to it  its not one of their lockers  whose is it  its mine  why did you even have to keep that stupid thing  its my only form of i d gus  hey  hey bros whats up  whats up  whats up is we know youre not a kicker  you guys saw me nail a  then what the hell are you doing working for the cops  okay okay  so maybe im not a player  im not a player but i crush a lot  wow i would have bet money they would have gotten that reference   i got it  thanks buddy  all right the jig is up im a psychic i work for the cops  you know what im tired of you messing with us  whoa whoawhoa what was that  i said im tired of you messing with us  not you  its vlad  hes speaking to me hes in a dark place  its hard to understand him he sounds a little like yaakov smirnoff  he also has some ritz bits in his mouth  cheese no peanut butter   shawn  okay ill tell em  i said id tell em  all right vlad says he knows its an accident  oh im seeing through vlads eyes now  he invited you to go atving down by the lake  you were drinking  there was a horrible accident where vlad and matt  smashed into each other like two frozen christmas hams  vlad wasnt wearing his helmet  hit his head on a rock and by the time we got there   he was dead  shut up drew  matt you were thrown so violently from the atv  that the emergency switch tethered to your wrist left a burn just like vlad  and the foot the foot  just got ripped off in the middle of the accident  but you werent supposed to be doing any of that  so you had to cover it up or risk losing your contract  and thats worth millions   smallpox wrapping up the wrapup  what   putting a bow on it  the pox may be small  yeah thats really really very very impressive guys  too bad weve already dug ourselves so deep  we cant let you ever tell anyone about it  then again   i could be dead wrong  yup  i mean i just i just heard it all from a locker  what the hell does it know  seriously heres what i think we should do guys   gus run  yup  gus this way  well use the phone in the press box  come on gus this is what we worked so hard for  i was a training intern shawn  guess you guys didnt know about the elevator   wait  get over there   what are we doing matt  yeah what are you doing matt  dont be rash and stupid now after you covered up the vlad accident so nicely  thats right i know  what the hell happened  i sensed a plan being hatched right there in the moment  you knew vlad was in trouble with the russians  you guys decided that would be the story  you dumped vlads body in the lake  and you left the foot right out there  where you were sure it would be found  you gave the cops exactly what they wanted  it was the text man the text to vlads phone afterwards  that was overkill thats what cost you  we have to get rid of em matt  no you dont  we know youre not murderers it was just an accident   yeah that we covered up  yeah  you can forget about our contracts  were going to jail  jails not so bad haveyou guys seen stir crazy  i bet theyll let you ride bulls  all right  well take em up to the roof  make em jump itll look like a hazing gone bad   come on  no no no  hey heyhey let go of em  coach  son  what

guys  yeah  you cant win without us  youre probably right  what  but that doesnt matter anymore  shawn you and your dad are people who  love football so much youd do anything to be close to it  and that made me realize whats most important  the game  to hell with you old man  well just get rid of you too  no no no you dont  well freeze  cop  you think id do all this without having backup  im not
