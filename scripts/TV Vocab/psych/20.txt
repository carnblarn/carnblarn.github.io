huh  and you havent grown up up  at all  jimmy as glad as we are to see you  what are you doing here  what do you think im doing here barf beetle  i came to take your lunch money hand it over  im just messing around  actually im in town for uh work  im sensing  you became a jockey  a jockey  yeah one of the best jockeys yeah i won most of my races  till this stupid santa barbara meet started  now im on some ridiculous losing streak  the last three favorites ive ridden have all lost  and i know it wasnt something i did i started to lose all my best mounts   mounts  horses guster  whats wrong with you  look uh jimmy what is it exactly youd like for us to do  well uh one of our friends from our old school  told me about your company even though it sounds kinda gay  i thought i could hire you to come down to the track  and maybe uh  psychically figure out whats wrong with the horses  okay first of all you ride on the back of mounts  while carrying a whip thats much gayer than what we do  either way were busy right now so i dont think well be able to   well take the case  i thought so  all right meet me at the track at 200  and as far as anyone else knows you guys are just some really   good old friends  got it dillholes  got it you can count on us dillholes  goodbye jim   are you crazy  i wouldnt say crazy  maybe an eccentric who looks good in jeans  come on gus youre not actually still afraid of jimmy nickles are you  were not helping that little monster shawn period  okay so jimmys still a jerk we can see that  but the truth is   i feel like i owe him  for what  if anything he owes us for 170 lunches  you know i added that up once and with inflation thats like 1800  look do you rember when jimmy got kicked out   of school in the fifth grade  for killing a teacher  for hitting miss lepky with a spitball   she fell and got hurt  same difference  she couldve very well have been killed  it was me who ratted him out gus  you did that   why didnt you ever tell me  you dont know all my secrets  im a man of untold mysteries  if he found out hed come back   and gnaw off one of my toes  ratting out jimmy nickles  thats suicidal  i thought i saw him do it and i told principal tropp  because he said he wasnt gonna let the class go until somebody gave him a name  and what you just had to get home  dude chips was gonna come on in like 20 minutes  what was i supposed to do  it was the one with the freeway crash  where the car used the empty car carrier trailer as a ramp   and flipped in midair  that happens in every episode shawn  i was under a lot of pressure  i always knew you were a kissass  who cares so jimmy got kicked out  it was the best day of my life  i could finally wear underwear to school again  i dont know gus  i always sort of felt like i got the wrong guy  ill never forget the look on jimmys face  when they hauled him out of class that day  i didnt do it i promise i didnt do it  look after jimmy got kicked out of school  there were all these stories about what happened to him  he ran away from home he got thrown in juvenile hall  moved to a small town in kansas  where they out lawed singing and dancing  that last one is footloose  thats a coincidence  the point is jimmys life changed that day  and i feel like i gotta make it up to him  who knows gus i mightve stunted the kids growth  i dont know shawn were talking about the same dude  who made aaron rencher eat his own retainer  all right how about this we take the case right  we prove for all the aaron renchers of the world  we are no longer afraid of jimmy nickles  all right fine  but if we take this case were gonna overcharge him by 1800  done  he doesnt like the oats  or the alfalfa pellets theyre too chewy for pellets  pellets should be crunchy  they should have a natural crunch to them  also the donkey in stable 11 is a pathological liar  this is idiotic  look it takes a while for the connection to take hold jimmy  runny d and i are just feeling each other out here  whatever i gotta go lose five pounds before the next race  you got half an hour to figure out whats going on  what do you think runny d  ill tell you what hes thinking  hes thinking i hate jimmy  he pulled my shorts down in front of jenny scarlatos in the cafeteria  are you channeling the horse or a little boy with a tight fade  who used to wear his ops without a drawstring  the horse shawn  i didnt have a tight fade in the third grade  how are you  thats interesting  this place is weird and borderline depressing  i mean who are these people who actually comes here  well well well this i never thought id see  wow dad  tell me youre wearing that shirt  because someone has to spot you from space  very funny shawn  this happens to be one of my lucky track shirts  i like it  id like it too if i had to walk home in the dark  henry this your kid  hey kid phil the thrill shershow  shawn this is burton oil can guster  good to meetcha hey henry tell ya for 20 years  i been handicapping horses  that seems so very cruel  he musta told ya i hit the pick six in 87  hey phil i think its pretty safe to assume   i havent told em anything  five minutes to post  gotta make it back  henry tell ya i like the 234 trifecta box  i think your shirt and his shirt should get together and go bowling  you have all kinds of interesting pals i dont know about  all right shawn look dont start phil is not a pal  hes a bad gambler who doesnt know when to quit  but he also happens to be on a hot streak right now  which is why i let him talk to me not that i need it  i have won 8 of 11 races today all by myself  all right shawn what are you doing out here anyway  i tried to drag you out here for years  im only here today cause were working on a case  you know i think the reason you never came out here  is because to be a good handicapper  you gotta put in the time you gotta do the research  you gotta study the horses you gotta study the jockeys  something that takes patience and followthrough   which you lack  yes  that and a shirt from mr furleys closet  and the race is on  babyfaced assassin takes the early lead  babyfaced assassin strides into the first  so whats the case  have you ever heard of a jimmy nickles  you mean jimmy nicholas yeah solid jockey bad bet   hes been losing lately  thats why he hired us  he thinks that maybe somethings psychically wrong with the horses  yeah the horses are losing thats whats wrong with them  yeah we didnt find anything  of course you didnt theres a million reasons a horse loses  and none of em have to do with crystals and moon beams  and its youthful spirit youthful spirit pulls it out  what i do is much more than that   its its intuition  son you got no case  oh well thanks well just go home then   juan carlos  help him  medical assistance to the track  we need medical assistance to the track immediately  carlos  so a jockey who was alive at the beginning of the race  is dead by the end  not to sound insensitive but i say we do have a case   that sounds insensitive  yeah i know  and you guys just happened to be at the track  jules its free churro day  do they have a cause of death yet  probable heart attack  uh ohara i  need you to interview the rest of those jockeys   what is that  sorry  its just little people make me  well lets just say i had a bad experience with a christmas elf  what he didnt give you the right present  no we dated  and then he dumped me for a dancer from the ice storm on ice  she is an enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle  shawn i dont think juan carlos died of a heart attack  i only got to see him for a second  but im pretty sure he had blood shot eyes  and his body was totally stiff  thats a reaction to a tranquilizer or even a poison  something affected his nervous system  thank you dr pratt   see if we can get another look at that body   you bet  hey you two dont go anywhere i wanna talk to you when im done  gus has a cramp  i have a cramp  we have to pee  fine just be back in five minutes  we gotta pee thats the best you can come up with  just hurry up  really  how short was this guy give it one more  we have boots  weve confirmed that a heart attack was the cause  of juan carlos espinozas death  wait everyone stop  lets acknowledge that the chief is wearing leopard print  and continue  im getting something  a rose with with with a thorn no  a rocket rikki rocket c deville   david lee roth  wrong band   poison  yes poison  juan carlos was poisoned   hes right  chief i am so sick of lassiter  treating us like secondclass citizens   what  youre right  espinoza had a cocktail of drugs in his system  opiates barbiturates cocaine  three different kinds of weight loss drugs   cyalis and horse tranquilizers  horse tranquilizers  apparently the guy took everything in sight  he was 49 and 3 feet of that were drugs  and obviously his heart couldnt handle it  a very thorough job detectives  im getting something else  juan carlos was having an affair  with a married woman   shawn how do you know this  same way i know that as a child  lassie wanted nothing more than a pony  well come on who didnt  anyone who wasnt an eightyearold girl  uhoh i see a tall blonde woman   brigitte nielson  no  she has 23 diamonds in her wedding ring  and she bandies about the track this way and that  shouldnt we at least find this woman and talk to her  do you know anything about this detectives  oh well maybe you should find out before we put this case to bed  lassie  your childhood mustve been pure hell  the good news im available for hugs  jules how about it   buddy its been a while  please   youre here early  yeah couldnt sleep you know  came in early did a little work on the case went for a run  oh and i did this  nice i did some work as well  turns out the horse tranquilizer juan carlos had in his body was ketamine  which doesnt make any sense  cause ketamine causes a state of anesthesia  well thats good gus but i was talking about the spitball incident  the spitball incident  shawn you need to leave that alone  if you havent figured it out by now you never will  i cant leave it alone i wont  ive gone over it in my head a thousand times just hear me out   what are you doing here  this is my head dude  i can do whatever i want what did we miss  whats going on here  is that what my hair looks like in the future   it sure is  but i thought id be bald by 20   this changes everything  yeah it does  think big  it was jimmy  hes sipping through the straw not spitting it out  it couldnt have been him  there was a second spitter  thats so cool  let it go shawn  your second spitter theory is crazy  oh yeah what about your teen wolf theory  hey thats just a fact  if any of us were in high school and some dude became a wolf  we wouldnt be cool with him just because he could dunk a basketball  i certainly wouldnt be selling i heart wol i could tell you that   oh save it for your podcast  hey you brought it up  im gonna go talk to jimmy nickles  you look for tbw   tbw  tall blonde woman  i abbreviated gus all the kids are doing it these days  just hope we dont run into my   yd  yd  your dad and its too late  oh my god the shirt has a brother  ha very funny shawn  if youre looking for your boy jimmy they just announced  he was taken off all the races for the day  seriously i wonder why  isnt that barry sarner the announcer guy   hes like a local legend  yeah the voice right yeah  hey dad do you know him can you introduce us or what  no i met him once at a policemans ball but it was years ago  hey uh mr sarner   hi  look whos here  your old pal hank spencer   do i know you  no but we know you  what is it you always say  and the race is on and the race is on  and the race is on   hey can you do it for us one time  and the race is on  thats it right there  wont you boys have a button  im sorry mr sarner im henry spencer  this is my son shawn and his friend gus  they finally just started coming to the races  oh too bad  the tracks probably closing down after this meet   25 years ive been doing this  why is it closing down   well no one comes anymore  is it because of his shirt  im sorry dad this is like a genocide of color  somewhere a rainbows weeping mr sarner do you know why  jimmy nickles was pulled off all of his races today  were his buddies we came down to see him  no uh its a shame really  jimmy was just getting back to a full schedule  juan carlos had taken most of his good mounts   before he died  really we didnt know that  oh they quarreled about it all the time  did they  shawn look tbw  way to stay on the abbreviation train gus  you mean the at  youre talking about janine thats jimmys wife   tbw is jimmys wife  yes  looks like juan carlos was taking all of jimmys mounts  i didnt kill juan carlos i didnt do it i swear   come on you gotta believe me  back off  okay so let me get this straight  you took on this case because you felt bad  about jimmy getting kicked out of school for something he didnt do  and now you just convinced the police to reopen the case  that led to jimmy being arrested for murder  did i ask for nutshelling  i think he looks like a tangelo in that outfit  or maybe a clementine with seeds full of hate  i think he looks like an evil little creamsicle   you mean dreamsicle  no shawn creamsicle  theyre exclusively orange  okay lassiter says you can have five minutes with jimmy  sweet  and good job by the way  we never wouldve reopened the case and arrested him if it wasnt for you  you didnt tell jimmy that did you  no   i didnt kill juan carlos  we know  someone mustve tippedem off but i swear i didnt do it  say jimmy isnt that exactly like you  and that spitball incident  guys  look i think what gus is trying to say is wed really like to help   we would but the evidence  what   juan carlos took all your mounts  yeah   you fought with him over it  yeah   they found ketamine in your locker  that wasnt mine  and your wife was having an affair with juan carlos  what  all right purvis put me down  dont push me  im getting the feeling he didnt know about the affair  you think  im sorry i just i cant believe she would do that  especially after i told her i wouldnt sleep with any more russian models  i think we may have gotten off point jimmy  lets go back to the beginning  obviously the races you lost  are somehow connected to juan carloss murder  so is there anything else you can tell us  or that you remember about those races  no the horses were all running great  but right around the clubhouse turn they all faded down the stretch  all of them faded down the stretch  you know what yeah  good  thats a good place to begin  all right thats enough shawn lets go  youve been standing at that thing for an hour  let me take off my shoes and try it lying down  no shawn you dont have anything  its a dead end face it   we have to tell jimmy hes screwed  fine   you tell jimmy  me  i never wanted to take this case in the first place  ill race you for it  what no  thats right and i know why  why  cause i beat you in the 100yard dash in the junior high olympics  please first of all  you know i had shin splints a torn meniscus and a planters wart  gus you copied those terms from the glossary of our health textbook   you have no idea what they mean  ask my doctor  i had a ruptured patella too but i wasnt gonna say anything  besides   go  oh no no you didnt   you almost had me  what  i had you by at least a foot   im gonna give this to you  i thought so  not because you won  cause you need a victory in your life more than i do right now  what  oh no were going again  i got a better idea  seven flights of stairs just to get another view of the track  gus this is the perfect spot for us to see  youll find  to see where the magic happens i told you hed be here  can i help you fellas  uh yeah uh  and the race is on  i really dont think you should be up here right now  im trying to finish my taped announcements for the day so  ooh can i do one ive always wanted to be an announcer  would the owner of a red irocz in lot three  kindly return your comb to the back pocket of your acidwash  z cavariccis  and turn off your headlights  what do you think of that huh  have a button  hey ive seen one of these before  yes its a shamans staff  yeah i saw a special on the history channel  about the the choctaw indians  ah yes the chaka indians  longstanding rivals of the sleestak cowboys  its pronounced choekoe  gave us the chocodile amongst other things  i dont think so  ive been collecting these artifacts for a number of years  im actually 116 indian myself but not cherokee  hey gus is 116 robot  and not the evil takeovertheworld fromi robotkind  oh sorrry  hey youre the guy that tried to save juan carlos  youre the only one who tried to help way to go you should feel proud  yeah  uh he died  yes he did do that  yeah  well gentlemen uh  ryan and i have to go over some publicity photos so if youd be kind enough  and the race is on  chaka really yeah id be embarrassed if i were you  im not embarrassed at all gus  aland of the lost reference is virtually unheard of in everyday conversation   can we go and see jimmy now  not yet  barry has tapes of the races in there  which means theres a copy of the one juan carlos died in  i dont know why i didnt think of this before  we need to see that tape  theres no way barrys gonna let us back in there  dont the police have a copy of it  they do but lassiters convinced the case is closed so he wont help  which means im gonna have to do something i know i will regret  what ride your dirt bike off of david kings roof again  no ask my dad for a favor  so i was hoping that in your very meticulous detailed mode  it occurred to you to  i cant do it  he wants to know if you tape all the horse races   of course i do  awesome  can we watch the one when juan carlos died  you may  on one condition  deal is you go with me to the derby on sunday  in that shirt  what did i say about regret gus   what did i say  i think you pull it off  shawn  fine  all right heres the race  juan carlos is on the number eight horse  i remember this cause phil convinced me to go with the long shot  the one time i go with the guy and the horse loses  i dont get it what are we missing   what what arent we seeing  maybe nothing   maybe jimmy did poison juan carlos  i know he didnt poison juan carlos  just like i know theres a second spitter  shawn once again youre focusing too much attention  on one aspect of the case   close your eyes  no  im not jumping through any more of your hoops today  you need to broaden your vision shawn you need to look at the outskirts   of the case  what does that even mean  broaden my vision  look at the outskirts of a you know what  im out of here  no no no not today  you sound like oprah  i dont even know why i bother coming here  its a complete waste of time  a little girl outside just started crying when she saw this shirt  oh good good youre here  you texted me seven times said it was an emergency  yes a color emergency but i think i figured it out  the walls were sandbar white  to suppress all creative thought and hide the asbestos  the walls of what  miss lepkys classroom  why is my name on the detention list  you got caught eating a kit kat out of the trash can   the point is when i left my dads  you mean stormed out like a little girl  i did not  i did  id give you that  i realized my dad was actually right  i need to broaden my vision and thats when i remembered  we all switched seats in class that week  right i had to sit behind janie doran and her creepy neck hair  and jimmy  moved over two rows  meaning that the second spitter was on the other side  gus get him  shawn what does this have to do with horse racing   i havent gotten that far yet  let me know when you figure it out  let go jimmy   hello  dude i figured it out   was that really necessary  no  but it was dope  babyfaced assassin strides into the first turn  at the head with none other right on its tail   babyfaced assassin  wait for it  trade the top spot as they race around the second turn  right there the clubhouse turn  juan carlos gets hit by something  this was just like the spitball incident with jimmy  i was so focused on the stretch that i never looked anywhere else  you know i didnt broaden my vision dad  shawn i love nothing more than to tell you im right  but i have no idea what im right about  question is why would somebody kill someone like that  guys juan carloss death was an accident  yeah whatever hit him was meant for a horse  this isnt about murder  its about fixing races   the tapes ready  check   fake psychic ability  full of it  yes you are  mr spencer what is going on first you help us get oh  get jimmy nicholas now you claim hes innocent  im sorry chief  psychic solar flares have temporarily blinded me  my sense of smell is compensating for my lack of sight  lilacs in a meadow   is that camay  oh this is ridiculous  weve got big boy police work to do  wait  my eyes are starting to adjust  where are we  were in the video room  im blind gus not deaf  mr spencer we dont have time for this if you wanted  those tapes   what are on those tapes  theyre the tapes from the track  we reviewed them but we didnt find anything     doritos  big gulp   slurpee  711  these are all the dates on the tapes  gus lets play these tapes  stop  stop  stop  stop  these are jimmys races   this one is when juan carlos died  that must be why theyre in my head  all of these horses faded down the stretch  as if affected by something  and look here  juan carlos is clearly hit by something at the clubhouse turn  he felt the effects immediately because hes a tiny human person  with the horses it takes longer for them to feel the effects  and your point is  whatever hit juan carlos was intended for his horse  what im saying is that this was an accident  mr spencer thats a very interesting theory but its  all circumstantial were gonna need some hard evidence  yeah but thanks for the av class  youthful spirit fades down the stretch no wait hes  hes gaining its youthful spirit youthful spirit pulls it out  youthful spirit fades down the stretch no wait hes  hes gaining its youthful spirit youthful spirit pulls it out  the announcer its the announcer  he sounds surprised neigh shocked  when youthful spirit doesnt fade down the stretch  listen  youthful spirit fades down the stretch no wait hes  hes gaining its youthful spirit youthful spirit pulls it out  he was expecting something to happen to juan carloss horse  that means hes a part of it  chief every psychic nerve in my body tells me that something really big  is gonna happen at the derby tomorrow and that we all need to be there  all right  its too late to cancel the races  but i can approve a police presence at the track  ive never been in the jockey club before shawn  thanks for getting me in here  its a good thing we wore our lucky shirts huh  yeah just worried someones gonna stare directly at  the pattern and have a seizure  shawn weve had people watching barry for the last six races  and they havent seen anything out of the ordinary  admit it you guys dont have it  dont worry we have it  i dont know if we have it  we just gotta figure out how it all connects  so what is this indian stuff i got off the internet connect to  thats what we in the fake psychic community call a hunch  ladies and gentlemen the horses have reached  the starting gate for the 84th running of the santa barbara derby  and the race is on  uhoh two horses bump as they come out of the gate  its the three horse snare the prize and the four biased opinion  kates conscience takes the early lead as the horses reach the first turn  authority figure makes a  strong move on the inside as the horses race down the backstretch  authority figure and kates conscience battle their way past the fall turn  authority figure begins to take control  phil is not a pal hes a bad gambler who doesnt know when to quit  but he also happens to be on a hot streak  henry tell ya i like the 234 trifecta box huh  tracks probably closing down after this meet  25 years ive been doing this  dude i got it  get everyone down to the track  and authority figure wins with ease  i really would like to cash in my tickets now  well how did she feel coming around the backstretch  everybody hold your horses  i meant metaphorically but i like the love  i sense the plan  hatched from the desperation of watching the track  they all love so much shuttered forever  isnt that right  barry   excuse me  you are so not excused  you see the track is closing down this year and  barry finally figured out a way to get paid  but it was the equine who told me he had help  two people with intimate knowledge of the races and access to the entire track  they figured out how to control the outcome of the races  by getting rid of the favorites  because there were only a few horses in the race to begin with  they bet on the rest of the field and their odds of winning went way up  that is insane we didnt do anything  thats not entirely true  whoa whoa whats happening here   gus little help buddy  i dont do horses shawn  ah dale dale uh  hold that thought   what was i saying  barry was saying  they didnt do anything  really  you used phil to make all the bets on the long shots  and ryan here  well he took care of knocking out the favorites from his perch  in the camera well   with what his camera  exactly  lassie do me a favor take that camera off ryans neck  give it a look  theres no lens  its some kind of firing mechanism  which is why he didnt follow the horses down the track  i just wanted to make some money   it was barrys idea  shut up ryan  they cant prove anything  im getting something  a fraction     barrys 116 choco indian  and what are the choco indians known for  besides chocodiles  for using blowguns to kill animals with darts dipped in poison  gus shoots and scores  with an assist from wikipedia  they used darts dipped in ketamine  a horse tranquilizer strong enough to slow down a horse in the middle of a race  with darts small enough to be missed on a 1000pound horse  but the problem was  they accidentally shot juan carlos  the ketamine mixed with all the other drugs in his system  and the adrenaline from the race killed him  ryan you werent trying to save juan carloss life  you were looking for the evidence  and they almost pulled it off  by framing poor jimmy  but they couldnt resist one more big pay day in todays race  its like my dad always says  real men take bubble baths  and a bad gambler never knows when to quit  not bad kid  not bad  lets go get em out of here  now who wants to take a picture with the winning horse and jockey   come on dad  gus get over here  hey i finally get my picture with us in our track shirts  memories shawn thats what its all about   just act natural  yeah  guys i dont know what to say  i guess youre not such total fartknockers after all thanks  thats so sweet  gus isnt there something you wanted to say to jimmy here  yes i do  ive been wanting to say this for a long time   you know back in school  oh uh about that  i had some time to think while i was in jail and uh  maybe i didnt treat you guys so good back then  especially you guster  so im sorry  im sorry for giving you wedgies swirlies jimmy nickle sandwiches  stuffing you in the trash can and uh   putting boogers in your clarinet case  whoa  feels good to get that off my chest after all these years  huh yeah  i could imagine  say shawn isnt there something you want to get off of your chest   are you gonna tell him if i dont  what do you think  all right jimmy heres the thing  im the one that ratted you out over the spitball incident  okay im the one that got you kicked out of school  and i am the one that you should blame for almost ruining your life it was me  almost ruining my life  yeah i went to live with my dad in maul he let me do anything i wanted  i ate pizza and cookie dough for breakfast  i had a race car bed i lost my virginity at 13  it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me  hi  you two are back together huh  dude shes a former miss oxnard  with no sense of smell and her dad owns an airport  course were back together latro boys  okay see  that right there makes total sense in the world  yeah but we can feel good about solving the case  dont you eh me  dude i broke up a highly intricate racefixing syndicate while  wearing a shirt designed by a monkey coming off a threeday sugar binge  yes yes you did shawn  but you still havent figured out who the second spitter was  in miss lepkys class   gus  yes  you didnt  yes i did  you did that   and you never told me about it  you dont know all my secrets shawn  i guess i too am a man of untold mysteries  burton guster i am seeing you in a completely different light  you are dare i say dastardly  hey i didnt want miss lepky to get hurt or anything  but when jimmy got blamed my mouth was shut  unbelievable  face it shawn i am and always will be that good  thats why my friends in school used to call me the g  thats funny i thought they called you big head burton  dont you ever say that name   i know it was you that started that  im sorry gus  i have a knack for alliteration im a slave to it  besides how many words start with b really  about 1000  how about bold  black beautiful   whos gonna call you black burton  you get my point shawn  all right  ill tell you what im gonna buy you an ice cream  and were gonna discuss some new fresh to death nicknames  how about  burton the billowy bear  what  im just  spitballing its my first shot
