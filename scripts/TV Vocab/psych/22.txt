funny  while reconfiguring the receiver  we accidentally tapped into a cell phone call  being made from the meitner campus it was staticky  but we heard a deep gravelly voice talking to their cousin   someone named muriel  and you want us to figure out why  someone would name their kid muriel  the voice said something like  im not gonna be pushed into a corner again  are you sure it wasnt dirty

lived in a cemetery   next to a cemetery  so she claimed  if i remember correctly you were always too afraid to follow her home   so any leads yet  hold it there doogie  first things first where do i

to die cast it onto steel and wear it on his lapel  thats not an s  thats the integral sign in calculus for the area under the curve xy  whoever was skulking around here after hours must be a math

blend in act natural  how bout these kids today huh  oh my god look at this selection of donuts  this is pathetic  who left a tenth i wanna know how that makes sense   you  shawn focus math teacher   theres no math teachers here  how do you know  that guys been wearing goggles hes clearly a chem lab teacher  violin hickey  music teacher  however a gym teacher could be more our speed  hey buddy uh were new here  and we were told to see a math teacher specializing in calculus  professor hahn handles all remedial math  that qualifies as remedial  whats calculus the one with the blocks and the shapes   do you know where we can find him  you can catch him at the end of the day   hes in my carpool  sweet gus this school has a carpool   answer to our prayers  why  gus managed to get his car impounded he parked on a statue   im contesting the ticket  heres the thing  we had to take the bus to school today  i accidentally gave myself a wedgy gus had to sit next to the girl who peed  why are you telling me all of this  i thought it seemed obvious can we get a lift home  so must be fun being a gym teacher you get to play sports all day  i teach gym at a school full of prodigy nerds  i start off my day by getting 300 notes  excusing kids from gym class because of rickets or ibs  i tossed a ball at a student once  he wet his pants and his parents filed a civil suit against me  professor hahn hahn  math teacher right  yes are you the new psychic lecturer  that i am im getting a feeling about you are you a right said fred fan   are you too sexy for your shirt  excuse me  im

right here stop right here  deep voice missed the carpool on friday  sounds like our guy now weve just gotta figure out  why and how hes gonna kill somebody  and one more thing if you are late picking me up in the morning  i will tear your head off  maybe just the how  are you prepared for your psychic seminar  gus please  any leads im adapting this into a nancy drew fanfic  i believe whoevers involved is in the vicinity  we made notes for you bullet points you might wanna try to hit   dont show any fear  dont split any infinitives   dont dangle your participles  at least not in public  look if i understood what you guys were saying  id still be a virgin now run along go to class  really  hahn is here  the seminars open to both students and teachers gus  i personally extended hahn an invitation so i can grill him  in front of a live studio audience  if hes killed before ill get him to confess  howre you gonna interrogate someone and teach a class at the same time  first the carrot then the stick  you dont even know what that means do you  leave me alone  phsysics  the physics of psychics  im professor shawn spencer  i will be your psychic ferryman over the river styx  thats gus my ferry   hello  each one of us is born with a kernel  of what i like to dub paranormalevolance  i however was born with an extra normal amount  two cops to be exact allow me to demonstrate  congratulations on getting your braces removed  that doesnt mean youre psychic maybe youre just hyperobservant  you wear that white sweatshirt everyday  shall i tell the class why  you  you young man  a little aloe will do wonders for that combination skin  and perhaps you should use more care while shaving  or just wait until you can grow facial hair altogether  you couldve just smelled my aftershave on the way in  how bout a real test ill write the answer on the board  and ill tell you the question have at it young trebek   trebek i said  this is jeopardy   potent potables  questions that start with p  the smartass who thinks hes gonna make me look silly  who is this guy  your negativity is really impeding my psychic ability   or youre just a big fraud  go to the principals office   wait a sec  get out of here go  go go get out of here get out of here  none of you should be friends with him  psst hahn  professor hahn  im getting something from you  a kind of darkness yes  i see you clearly  with a target  i shop at target  sure but but i  i see you on a cell phone with your cousin  plotting planning something secret  yes  yes ive been planning a  surprise party for my sisterinlaw shes impossible to surprise  thats amazing  yeah well if shes gonna have puppies shes gonna have puppies  theres nothing we can do about it look if you had her fixed like i   do you need something  yes actually   well  well what  well order me off the phone  you need me to work and im wasting time  thats a nice touch  ive been reviewing the statement we took  from the kids on campus they said whoever this teacher is  hes already killed once and hes going to kill again   right  right  it strikes me that its difficult to solve a crime that hasnt happened yet so  why dont we focus our attention on the murder that already has   makes sense  great  these are the case files for every unsolved homicide  in the santa barbara area over the last five years  lot of paper cuts there   have fun  no  i need you to review these  and tell me if there are any connections with the meitner faculty  yeah im not gonna do that  you delegate this background stuff all the time  to me usually almost always when i have dinner plans  now  go through these with a finetooth comb and tell me what you find   if its not too much trouble  ohara you are drunk with power  i know isnt it great  and that amazing demonstration is phsysics at work  its like thinking of a song and then bam its the next tune on the radio  or or that moment when you know its right to kiss a girl  thats when you use the power  professor hahn   im still sensing something from  um professor  call me sensel   how can we harness  uh uh uh sensei   sensel  yes  how can we harness this power to help us um  kiss girls  ill take it from here shawn  oh i dont know gus  now may not be the time to impede their psychosexual development  well maybe youve forgotten that i was the one who took  the hottest girl in school to the prom  thats because i told her you were dying  otherwise i would have had to pay for the limo myself  let me take this please  gus my ferry  thank you shawn  now kissing someone for the first time can be tricky business  i like to employ the kadeem hardison method  when youre on a date  uh uh i can sense a question forming in all of your minds  if its who is kadeem hardison  or how do we ask someone on a date put em down  listen its not your fault  just look at this class youre all a bunch of dudes  um were girls  thats awkward  ill cover all the dating stuff in my next seminar  puberty  monster or misunderstood friend  that kid i sent to the office had some weird zit cream on  professor enrico  guster burton guster  you interviewed me for admission   math prodigy  i interview people all the time  was this recently  semirecent   but i tapdanced in trochaic tetrameter   made you wanna cry  that rings a bell  so visiting the old alma mater   no i went to public school  really  couldve sworn i recommended admission  either way i assume a person with your skills ended up at jpl  or some kind of think tank  actually i ended up in pharmaceuticals  you know curing stuff  well keep up the good work  thank you  dude you didnt even mention magic head  guys were freaking out  were pretty sure professor hahn is our guy   so turn him in to the cops  not without proof   know anything about him  the only time we see him  is when he gets his espresso in the morning before homeroom   theres an espresso bar here on campus  wait  wasnt hahn involved in that thing you remember that thing   the thing with the other thing  no no just the first thing  from five years ago when the student attacked the professor  oh yeah that couldve been hahn  some student attacked hahn and he made sure the headmaster expelled him  whos the student that attacked him  according to the school computers  the only kid to be expelled in the last ten years was a lester baekeland  what are you doing  getting the plague apparently  god  babcock babette battra something  baekeland  god  i can see why you wanted to go here gus  they keep meticulous records of everything just like you  expelled for cheating  dude theres a transcript of his hearing   what does it say  the kid claimed  hahn busted him for cheating  then tried to extort his scholarship money from him to stay quiet  hahn denies it  headmaster of course sides with the teacher the kid gets expelled  that means hahn is a blackmailer  maybe he threatened the wrong person this time  gus  gus  i got in  i applied and i got in that means a lot buddy  youd rather stay with your best friend than   you know have a future  no shawn  it says parents of applicant refused admission  if id known id gotten in i wouldve been ghost  this place has a direct line to the ivy league   why would my parents turn it down  i dont know   maybe it was just too expensive  i couldve gotten financial aid shawn  half the kids here are on scholarships with stipends  can we not obsess about this right now we do have a murder to prevent  im not obsessing shawn  i just found out that the course of my life may have been changed by my parents   youve seen sliding doors  i most certainly have not   yes you did  dude i have not seen sliding doors  it was me you and missy isaacs what are you talking about  im talking about a gwyneth paltrow vehicle that i know i never saw  please i know youre home  this is my fifth message call me back  theyre just screening my calls until ive let this go  but its not gonna happen  gus lets face it  your parents thought splitting us up at a young age was a mistake  and i cant say i blame them  for a while i was your only friend that wasnt imaginary  or an action figure of some kind  shawn if anything my parents wanted me to stay in public school  so that i would stand out compared to people like you   yeah no holes in that theory  i dont know which is worse  my parents dodging my calls  or you volunteering me to pick up a murderer first thing in the morning  dude it is your turn to drive the carpool  whats our plan  today is murder day  speaking of murder day is that really what youre wearing  shawn in about two minutes were gonna be in a confined space with a killer  please tell me you have a good reason  of course i have a good reason gus  this time itll be just you me and him  and i will totally break him down  thats hahns house  or  maybe itll just be you and me  well according to our arson investigator  here is our murderer  apparently there was a slight gas leak in the stove  overnight the room fills with natural gas  the coffee pot clicks on in the morning theres a spark and kaboom  no im sensing it was definitely more of a kablam   so youre saying this was an accident  arson investigator says  theres no sign of foul play  the only time we see him is when he gets his espresso  in the morning before homeroom  wait im having a vision  hahn preferred italian coffee espresso  why would he be brewing coffee here  if he was gonna get his fix in the morning at school  im sensing our killer brought the coffee machine here  and used it as a detonator after creating the gas leak  what killer spencer   our expert says its an accident  i say murder  its what drew me to this wretched place  talk to the girl who makes the espresso  i usually dont do this but i have a strong sense shell back this up  hahn had a cup first thing every morning  what do you call those coffee people theyre not   cashiers theyre not waitresses  barista  gus if you dont know the answer dont make up words  dude hahn was broke  no wonder hes a blackmailer  the due date for the payment is the same as murder day coincidence  i think not  it was staticky  but we heard a deep gravelly voice talking to their cousin  someone named muriel  we are so on this case now  its your call ohara  either its an accident and were done  or its a homicide and theres a killer on the loose  i dont buy this accident angle for a second  those kids practically said this would happen  lets bring them back in for questioning  if you confess now name your accomplices  i will let the da know that you cooperated and maybe  just maybe no guarantees just maybe  theyll cut you a break  its terrible   what  am i scared  am i quaking no that was what i call   lower case mad you need to be   upper case mad  those strange kids are in interrogation b  listen ohara  given your slightly pedestrian performance  and the fact that this has now jumped to a straightup homicide   maybe i should take over as lead  but why its my case  which was fine when it was just kids telling tales but  there are certain nuances involved in a murder investigation which   require a more experienced touch  nuances  the chief says ill learn by being primary   yeah but  but what  there was an explosion  ive never had a case with an explosion before  ive had assault and burglary cases  once i even had a murder by thermometer but i never had an explosion  come on havent you ever pictured yourself trying to out run a fireball  down a dark tunnel  no  obviously due to recent events we are taking a closer look  at everything surrounding the school including the statement you gave to us  you mean when we predicted someone was going to die today  and they did   well that and  watch your mouth kid  okay youre not fooling anybody we know whats going on here  what he means is  please tell us again about the phone call you overheard  no tell us about your relationship with hahn   you little son of a  lassiter stop theyre teenagers  were sorry  lesson 63   do not apologize to the perp  theyre not perps   you dont know that  you two arent really acquainted with  game theory or prisoners dilemma are you  he means you two dont really get the good cop bad cop dyad   are you guys like together  no shes way out of his league  but no ring given his age im guessing divorced   i wha sorry what  still cant talk about it  so its relatively recent then  im getting separated not divorced  did you ever just listen to her problems   rather than always trying to solve them  no you had to be the big tough cop  didnt you you never let her inside  see this brainiac  this is whats waiting for you when you turn 18 youre gonna graduate  and get your diploma and then bam  were taking a trip down to the docks  that doesnt look very intimidating with uh you know the one arm  when did my house become a daycare center  dad youve been bugging me for months to fix your computer  i finally bring the geek squad in to do it  and now youre gonna give me a hard time  thank you  hahn had someones juvenile record  maybe he dug up something on our killers past which means   we have to hack into the juvie database  yeah im with you  except for the part about coming to my dads house  well according to the kids the hacking may come back to us  now the authorities will be led to an antique computer  purchased by a former cop can you say wild goose chase  jeez this computer is ancient  i didnt realize colecovision was still in business  all right im in  muriel juvenile hall slash halfway house  what am i looking for  im sensing our investigation centers on the year 1991  91  theres nothing but a bunch of photos here  click on the top right  thats that kid i sent to the principals office  kirk godel  why the hell is a photo from today mixed in with photos from 91  its not  this photo was taken 15 years ago  im having a vision  the man from snowy river  eddie macons run  spartacus   kirk douglas  yes  see if theres a student named kirk  the registrar gave me access to all their files  its perfectly normal you know   what is  the anxiety of being in charge  i can sense you have the weight of the world on your shoulders  i just really wanna get this right  oh ive got something  kirk godel  godel  its almost pronounced like girdle because of the omelet on the o   pretty sure thats an umlaut  ive heard it both ways  lets see no juvenile record only child  all stats match up with his school records nothing out of the ordinary   lets see what google says  uh search it with the word muriel  oh heres an article from the muriel county newsletter  according to this article kirk godel and his parents  died five years ago in a car crash  there should be a death certificate on file but theres no sign of it  what the hell is going on  a little aloe will do wonders for that combination skin  circle your horses jules were about to crack your case like an egg  and then well make some umlauts with shallots  and justice  please take your seats  good im glad youre all on time for phsysics two  the wrath of khan  todays lecture will cover come uppance  and how to solve a crime in a crowded room  someone here is living a lie  someone in this room is a ghostfaced killah  its not you  but you have to do something about the hair immediately  okay id start now  you  your heart is pure id say lose the earring  but i actually think he pulls it off  but you y  why do they always run  dont they know it makes them look guilty  you need this guy  thank you detective lassiter  have a seat   you mind telling us what were doing here  well  as the beautiful industrious  detective ohara has already gathered  youre not the real kirk godel are you  will the real kirk godel please stand up  i dont think thats gonna happen  you stole the real kirk godels identity so that you could get into this school  but theres more to this case than stolen identity  yes  im sensing a much darker diabolical past  you did a stint in juvie for causing someones death    what are you nuts hes a kid  true  so how could this be possible class  time travel  he cryogenically froze himself   in order to travel to the future  no  hes a clone of the original  you know what just never mind guys  save it for your online role playing  hes wearing makeup   is he gay  no  well maybe  look i dont i dont know  but the reason hes wearing makeup is because he is actually 30   trying to pass for a teenager  30   what kind of moisturizer do you use  class i would advise you take notes  there will be a test on this  you were always the smartest kid in your class  but with juvie on your record you couldnt get into college  then one day you read a story about a 15 year old from your hometown  who died in a fiery car crash  and that was the real kirk godel  and you had a light bulb moment  all your life people thought you were younger than you looked  so you decided to take advantage of that  and hit a huge reset button on your life  you forged kirks documents  then you went online and deleted his death certificate  a new identity plus your natural intelligence  meant you were a cinch to make meitner  now you would graduate from one of the best high schools in the country  get a scholarship to the ivys  and become a young captain of industry  and it was all rolling along beautifully until hahn  discovered your dirty little secret  he blackmailed you for your scholarship stipend  he needed money to make a bank payment by wednesday  money you werent willing to pay  you were so distraught you called your cousin to vent  you decided that the only way out was to kill hahn  and make it look like an accident  finally you hacked in and deleted  all records that you were ever in juvie  brilliant until the end  well until this until this last part  when you got caught  on the wild line  like a salmon  pencils down  come on  cuff him ohara  here use mine  youve earned it  anything else i need to learn  theres one last lesson  forget all the other lessons and know that youre a good cop  you know im gonna need those cuffs back right  good   martinsdale  macendale  jay macendale  once we had the name it was pretty easy to track the rest  when he was 15 he stole a car on a dare  accidentally killed a pedestrian and thats what got him in juvie  i cant believe he passed himself off as a teenager for this long  i dont know dad slap a wig on you  youre the spitting image of yourself when i was a kid  what is that supposed to mean  whats his problem   he finally got a hold of his parents  dont tell me it was too expensive  my file said i qualified for financial aid  quality of life  they have 247 slushy machines there  the lockers are made with teak thats the strongest wood  these pieces look like theyre handcarved shawn whats with the generosity  i saw you were still using the ratty board with the plastic pieces  so i went ahead and shoplifted this for you  im kidding i bought it  those kid geniuses turned me on to a great ipo  now remember i win i get the truck for a week  all right how bout i win you wash the truck for a week  yeah i really dont understand what that means  im out there in a pair of jean shorts   continuously washing the vehicle for a  shawn focus  focus  too far to drive  you derailed my future because dad hates curvy roads  i couldve been the next wittgenstein  i never got carsick a day in my life  gus doesnt deal very well with surprises  ill talk to you later mom  you never told him i was the one who ran over his dog did you  dad no  one thing at a time  thank god that dog was 17  checkmate
