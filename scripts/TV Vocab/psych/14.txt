cave gus and i sculpted last winter  what about your license   my pilots license   its out back in the cessna  or perhaps youre referring to my license to kill  revoked  problems at the kazakhstan border  i could give details but then id have to kill you  which i cant do because my license to kill has been revoked  im talking about your private eye license  what you need one dont you   psychics are exempt from the requirements  oh well  hooray for loopholes  a little dark  could use a couple more lamps youre probably killing your eyes  that outlet  looks a little overloaded  that plasma youd probably do better by putting it on that wall  youd have less glare coming in through the window in the afternoon  you know dad  i really appreciate you making the long drive down to feng shui it up sweet for us  but were kind of in the middle of something here  what would that be shawn  would that be nba  garbage can hoops  or trivia superchallenge   believe it or not we have an 1100  so maybe we should wrap this up  ah its a little too late for that shawn  i am your 1100   o i know you know that im not telling the truth o  o i know you know they just dont have any proof o  o embrace the deception o  o learn how to bend o  o your worst inhibitions o  o they will psych you out in the end o   bill peterson  he owns peterson motors  i met him about 20 years ago when i grabbed a couple of punks  boosting tires off of his lot  shawn shouldnt you be writing some of this down   why would i do that  will there be a quiz   would you shut up and pay attention   i got a call from him yesterday hes got a kid brandon  hes just a little younger than you  he thinks his son might be mixed up in something  like what   hell fill you in when he gets here  the point is he doesnt want cops involved so he called me  and you said  i said im retired  and he should definitely involve the cops  sweet you came all the way here to tell us that  awesome  no shawn  he doesnt want his son in trouble and i might have mentioned  to peterson accidentally that you  you might be able to help  whoa time out flag on the play  did you vouch for me   no i wouldnt say i exactly vouched for you   gus henry vouched for me  i did not vouch for you  you were bragging on me  you have a dadcrush on me  shawn i was not bragging on you  i merely restated stats about your track record that are in the newspaper   lets hug it out  put your arms down   give me hug  no im not going to give you a  if i had known that peterson was going to insist on hiring you  i would have blasted your character outright  and i would have mentioned your unnatural fear of pointy things  distaste for pointy things  please just do me this one favor would you listen to the mans story  tell him you cant help  send him to the cops and whatever you do  dont do it with all that  rolling your eyes around and all that  floppy crap  jesus  first of all i dont flop around all the time okay   my game is predicated on finesse   how dare you criticise my job  hes here  hes here dont tell him i came by do you got a back way out this place   you came through it  oh right  excuse me are you shawn   yes thats correct mr peterson  wow that is my name  dont be too impressed bill  i couldve gotten that information anywhere  after all peterson motors is gigantic   yeah well im suitably impressed  dont be burton guster  pleasure to meet you  look ill get right to it i have a son brandon  up until a few weeks ago he worked for me now hes disappeared  what happened a few weeks ago   i fired him he was lazy directionless  i thought i could get him to buckle down focus in on something  how did that go   well hes been evicted from his apartment his cellphones been cut off  and he forged a check from my account to the tune of 30000  i need to find my son  can you help me   well mr peterson this sounds like a case for the police  let me get you a number  gus dont be a gooey chocolate chip cookie  what   this is precisely what we do here sir  we find people  well find your brandon  okay make sure we are not disturbed i need five minutes uninterrupted  make sure no one comes in  yeah  whats with all the secrecy ohara   ive got a real mindbender  problem with the railway theft   no  its a detective  is this something for internal affairs   its detective lassiter  whats the problem with our head detective   well its his birthday  oh thats not a problem  yeah it is he seems quiet  he is quiet  thats who he is  ohara i think its nice that you care for your partner but hes a grown man  hell be fine  i just thought it would be nice to surprise him  oh  detective lassiter does not like surprises  of course he likes surprises everybody likes surprises  detective lassiter has a very particular comfort zone  and you dont even want to know what we now call the secret santa debacle of 2005  i just  wanted to do something nice for him but nobody seems to know what he likes  well youre his partner shouldnt you know   well we dont really talk  i mean he doesnt he  nods and responds mostly never really poses a question  although sometimes he asks if we can ride in silence  ohara  your heart is in the right place  but i am very sure you will have to do this yourself  okay fine  shawn what are we doing here   gus let me ask you something  whens the last time you were evicted from your apartment   never  exactly  you wouldnt understand  this is my world  so the landlord keeps brandons stuff as collateral  brandon comes back landlord gets paid brandon doesnt theres a garage sale  well the buzzer upstairs says that his is 227   marla gibbs   regina king  jackee  hal williams   hal williams   hal williams as lester jenkins  looks like somebody took a screwdriver to this thing  let me see  okay so brandon needed something inside here but he couldnt get in  if you were in his shoes what would you do next    first of all id feel  tell me about it  but then  i think id come back with some scissors  lets see if we can find what he was reaching for  here my reach is better   excuse me  what    when exactly did we have a  it has always been better  but my arms are slenderer  slenderer   what   slenderer   skinnier   yes  you know what  youre right  my biceps probably wouldnt fit through this thing anyway  i knew youd fall for that  lets see  final notice final notice  final notice plus an eviction   gosh this kid has some serious cashflow problems  no wonder why he stole from his pops  what do you got  a bunch of pawn shops  whoa wait a second  if youre a guy with an apartment whats the one thing you definitely dont have   i dont know a horse   a horse thats true   answer we were looking for was yard or garden  i would have accepted both yard   and garden  i was joking  so if youre a guy without a yard or garden  why would you have a business card for a garden supply store   what is rrlrll   rrl rll   of course rrila rilla  no no rrl rll  what does it mean   we should probably figure that out huh   you think   how long are we going to sit here   brandon might not even show up  when i suggested we do a stakeout you were like  no no we need to do something active   i am doing something active  what   im preparing to try and enjoy this chalupa  odd  no whats odd is the customers that keep driving into this place look at these cars  theyre ridiculous  theyre all fancy and whatnot  not exactly what you would use to pick up shrubs and fertilizer  lets see what these people are up to  lets go  wrong turn  what the  dude  its a maze  what is rrlrll   shawn what are you doing   right left right  dude the letters on the back of that card were directions  follow me  right  rrl rl   rrl  shshawn  left  left  whoa wait a second wait a

this   why   just hold it up there you go  now maybe next time you wont force me into such a barbaric form of retribution  good news  there appears to be a seat opening up  still i think our best course of action would be to   get the hell out of here  go go go go   i want you to know i cannot hear anything you say   shawn what the hell is going on  what the shawn what are you doing   its his ongoing sensorydeprivation experiment  sharpening one sense by denying others  in this case he cant hear which amplifies his sense of smell  amazing  thats one word for it  i need complete and utter silence  what do you need silence for shawn if you cant hear anything   please henry let the boy work  i smell chips   potato  potahto   lets call the whole thing off  mr peterson  i want you to grab
