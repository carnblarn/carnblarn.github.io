elevator  no bodies   a dogfighting ring a missing snowman  no  yes a snowman is missing but were not on that case relax   i am not working  i know you arent  i do not work on my birthday  i think youve made your position clear on that   then tell me where were going  thats not how a surprise works  happy birthday dude  welcome to the fall line launch party for ciao clothing  gorgeous models fake celebrities  no food though  this is the most exclusive event of the year  whats the rub  i think youre in the wrong line there gentlemen   i think were on the vip list  names  black and tan   first names  no first names  one of us is black and one of us is tan   were a modeling team  perhaps youve heard of us  lets just go  were retired  just check your list  holy crap it is here  sorry for the mixup tan  i beg your pardon  my name is black  his name is tan  i cant believe you just made that assumption  you should be ashamed of yourself and your family  okay how did you pull that off  well ciaos number was in the phone book  i dont ever want to hear again that my filipino accent doesnt work magic  this is one of the most thoughtful presents anyones ever given me  man thats berlinda desidovicz  the waitress  shes not a waitress shes the model  the one from the floppy cakes ad  the third girl on the left on that billboard i always point out   you know her name  her name i know her life story  she has a fan club well shes putting one together  im number one on the interest list  shes one of the most popular models in the entire santa barbara downtown area shawn  ive been in love with her since the icy pops ad   shes the one that says gooey   yes shes the gooey girl  this is huge for you man ill hook it up  i can take care of this myself what you think  should i pull out the cheetah  the cheetah is the worst name for a pickup move in the history of mankind  remember the rule treat a woman like a person  then a princess then a greek goddess then a person again  besides i think operation  colonel sugarlemons is a much better move for a place like this  cool  good luck  emily  ladies and gentlemen  our chairman and founder gregor uwe steeb  ciao  ciao  do not worry  i will raise this myself  im only the head of the company and after doing all the design work myself  i was looking forward to some menial work  gregor  oh my god  gregor  gregor  you absolutely sure you dont want to work tonight  you expect us to believe that you model  what thats hard to believe  what me and my bro here arent worthy of leering into a little camera lens  or bluesteeling it up occasionally  your bro of course  his features are immaculate  but you  not so much  what  what are you insane  help help me out here tan   hes a foot model  well that makes sense  really thanks for that  hes lying  it was foot and  ankle  and i did some hand work okay  perhaps you recognize this  from the insurance commercials  i have to go to the bathroom want to come   okay  ciao  she seems so bored so lonely  yeah but so does everybody here dude  did you notice that the mike stand was set too low when gregor came out on the stage  why would the mike stand be set so low when hes the only one who was gonna speak tonight   do you see the clock  but what if we stumble upon something huge  what does the clock say shawn   fine  thank never mind  its your birthday no work got it  all right you will each one by one go to the area ive  sequestered state the name of the agency you work for and  why am i surprised  usually its because just tell me if youve seen anything

boots  wow henry thats some wildlooking footwear  yeah   susan this is my son shawn and gus  nice to meet you  you can call me sue  most people call me sue b  because there are two sues at the office  but obviously thats not really a factor here  could you  help me in the kitchen with these  well be right back  so  heard about pluto  thats messed up  yeah  really dad  cheese cubes and wieners whats happening here  is this some sort of blind date  sort of i dont know  shes just  what do you call it nondescript  nondescript  ive never heard a woman described like that unless she was a robbery suspect  i just dont know i mean shes pretty  shes a little boring and prim  i cubed these myself  she didnt even try one  what do you think whats your opinion  i have no opinion of any kind whats oever  shawn come on you have an opinion on everything especially when it comes to women   just give me your first impression  no  why not  you have to get over this  nobody wants to grow old alone  maybe a nice lady will help him relax a little  new subject gus  did you see the chief run out of there  must be something big  you know i was thinking theres only 73 minutes left in your birthday   actually 72 minutes  not until midnight shawn  im cinderella and this is my ball  and im not lifting a finger until my carriage turns into a bigass pumpkin  got it good got it  thank you  okay where do you want all these people  just put em in both interrogation rooms and well rove it  lets go go go  so the electrical cable offstage was deliberately severed  the chief thinks it was done pro  that means   you dont remember where you were this afternoon  it was yellow  and boring  are we talking about a restaurant  i dont know maybe  just write down that it was lame  i do like that jacket  really  somewhere a transient is shivering in the night  detective  fine tell me what you got  hows it going crime fighters  theyre not very forthcoming or bright  one of them cannot confirm the correct spelling of his own name  did you by chance interview a model named berlinda is she still around  gus we dont have time for this  i know and thats why im here to offer our services  id rather shower with a bear  look theyre only gonna talk to their own kind okay  shallow judgmental cruel and gorgeous  were already embedded  what do you mean embedded  chief we may or may not have used deception to get into the party tonight  see you at swimwear wednesday   dont let em scare you tan  hes tan   they think were models  they think im a model   me too  a foot model  and ankle gus dude thats just ridiculous anyway everybody look at my jaw  well ive seen enough youre hired  what  hired you can look the word up change that tie detective  now mr spencer if you have a moment id like to see you privately  of course chief  ciaobella and gregor are home grown celebrities  the local media is sharpening its pencils on this one  and that is not the kind of press that this department or its interim chief needs   do i make myself clear  clear as a crystal ball  good so tell me  did your father say anything about my friend susan  they all live here  well gregor owns the building  the ciao studios across the street  he uses this loft for his prime models  i wonder if it looks like the loft in head over heels  you and only you can confirm that  my husbands funeral is tomorrow at 1225  be there no later than   and ill have to approve whatever youre wearing  now obviously  we have no choice but to continue with the fall line unveiling on wednesday  maam before we move on should i hire someone to do magnolias   tomorrow for the service  well of course hire someone emily  its not like they grow on trees  that marriage always seemed weird to me  like when liza minnelli married david gest  yeah well ciaobella and gregor lasted eight years gus  i suspect that some of those marblechiseled simpletons are more devious than they let on  were gonna have to dig deep and blend in in order to get real answers  dude you thought i was gonna have trouble blending in  i have this shirt this shirt  most of these shirts  and these are my exact kenneth coles  and that picture of my mom parasailing in montego bay  you moved me in  dude we got lucky they just threw some guy out  now we can live it up chic while we catch a killer   now help me set up my clapper  im not moving in here shawn  i dont care how many secrets we uncover  showers free  i got the window  you must be sigrid   what is that cossack  die  you can question her you know who im questioning  whats up roomies  initiation  thats what  put em up   im allergic to pillows tommy john both elbows  come on  give me your best shot  black  it would really behoove you guys to get our names right in the future  good berlinda youre here  look we are so out of the loop  you gotta catch us up on everything you know  the dead gregor thing that awful ciaobella   the agency  maybe we can play truth or dare  actually we were thinking about maybe going to a bar doing some 02  couldnt we do that after we talk because i know i have so many questions  i could be ready in three minutes  shawn  dad  how did you find me  shawn i was a detective for 15 years youre not hard to find  was that guy wearing a bra  could possibly be so important that youre here right now  its karens friend susan  she called again twice in the last two days  doesnt that reek of desperation  no no no this is not happening  shawn this is ridiculous  you come to me for advice on one of your stupid cases at least once a week  i ask for a simple assist on dating protocol you cant give it to me  call me oldfashioned shawn i havent been pursued by a woman in 33 years   it used to be the other way around you know  okay fine dad look  women your age they dont have time to play games  she was wearing a cardigan  but she saw the inside of your house and didnt run screaming in horror  ride the upside now i cant talk about this for one more second  because im proud of the fact that i have never been in therapy okay  shawn no   hello  dude what the hell happened to you guys  some of the models got creeped out that you hang with your dad all the time   what  all right fine  we were afraid if we hung out with him any longer we might catch wrinkles  just tell me where youre going   shawn i cant talk now  gus youre not being helpful  and we have a case to  solve  miss bloom  im sorry i didnt mean to startle you   im black  i know who you are  youre staying at the loft  youre the one no one believes used to be a model  whos saying these things  i believe you  thank you  i think your ankles are magnificent  well i play a lot of pingpong  wow these are really good  thank you  ive never really shown them to anyone before  why not  id totally wear these   this if i was very confused  yes  you know i just let gregor and ciaobella do the designs  its ciaobellas company now  well my lunch break is over  its after 900  yeah i kinda work long hours  im just so far behind ciaobellas gonna freak  ive gotta get back to work  will i see you tomorrow at the funeral  yes definitely  im yeah i think so yeah  good  dont work too hard  hi youve reached burton guster with central coast pharmaceuticals  leave me a message and ill get back to you  straight to voice mail  thats how were doing it now  one moderately hot chick comes by and suddenly im invisible  you know what gus thats fine  im taking the bunk next to the window  and dont be surprised if your pillow smells faintly of my butt  what is this  did you guys get up at dawn dude you couldnt give me a little shake  we got up five minutes ago  sigrid we can all go together  i would rather eat my own earlobes  than spend another hour with you callous monsters  that girls acting like a freak  did you accomplish anything last night besides selling me out for vacant head  yes i did  i found out that berlinda always wanted a pet dwarf bunny as a child  and she loves anything that smells and looks like lavender  sweet  lets call the chief and get paid  i also found out that ciaobella was grilling all of the models  because she was convinced that one of them was sleeping with gregor   really  yep  well that coupled with the fact that shes drunk with power  treating her sweet little assistant like dirt give us a pretty good suspect id say  lets crash a funeral  oh my god  is he wearing hugo boss  what a sellout  see you never  good night forever  you bald bastard  hold on  it was me who peed in the hot tub  okay  you reap what you sow uwe steeb remember that  you dont even know that dude  im in character shawn  besides berlindas listening shut up  you know what man  i didnt want to tell you this  berlindas the one that couldnt spell her own name  so  you dont know her like i do shawn   dude  what  that was a love note thats a love note thats a love note  she just hid a love note in the casket that means sigrid was gregors mistress  ciaobella found out about it and killed him i got it   you cant dance at a funeral shawn  all of a sudden youre the arbiter of good taste  we wait until its over and we do it without blowing my cover to berlinda  she only dates models  fine ill call jules  well thank you all for coming  we gather today not to mourn the passing  of my dead husband hassenfeffer  but rather to celebrate  all that he once was  while i will always miss  gregor uwe steeb  whose real name was gregory lapspanksi  i encourage you all not to cry  but to drink and laugh and dance  as we remember a man who once thought  a belt made of dried bits of panther was a good idea  goodbye my love  gregor  shes really planting one on him  miss masterson  ciaobella  ciaobella  ive changed my mind  it wasnt the wife  i loved gregor and he loved me  but he wasnt gonna leave his wife and you never learned to share as a child  so you went ahead and killed them both  for symmetry  sound about right  no it wasnt like that  i mean sure it was frustrating  i couldnt say anything about her without him flying off the handle  he wouldnt even let me drink out of the same glass as her  he said that comparing me to her  was like comparing cleopatra to miss cleo   you think berlindas back at the loft  that analogy doesnt make any sense  it would if you knew who either of them were  but i was sharing  i accepted it  a piece of him was enough  i mean it was that or nothing  i miss him so much  he was the only one that knew how  to accentuate my shoulders  to make my waist and hips look smaller  you realize you had more motive   than anyone sigrid  no  now emily bloom has taken over sole creative control  of ciao i mean she inherits everything  emily bloom   who  the mousy assistant  she started as an assistant thats just how they treated her  but shes third in line  interesting  she failed to mention that little factoid   is that the same suit  yes okay it is  i can get more than one wearing out of a suit in a work week   its the same tie  get out of here  dont go getting any ideas about hopping a plane to trinidad and tobago  youre not out of the woods yet missy   whats the plan stan  go away  the reason we brought you in on this case was so that people would stop dying  ohara get down to ciao i want you to put the clamps on miss bloom  our little kiwi ladder climber  check  then i will pay the penalty to terminate the contract  william will you please make sure  those pleather samples make it to alicia silverstone before 300  dont even give it another thought  no a bunny does not need to go blind in order to confirm  that our buyers should not eat our clothing  how would you like it if i doused your retina in henna  you cromagnon piece of   im detective ohara from the  screw you  lets acknowledge the curve samantha  you know real women real figures  just raise the waist line make it an a cut  and dont think for one second i didnt notice your new bangs   you look 21 again  miss bloom i need to ask you a few questions  and were walking  we believe that both your predecessors were killed by the same person  and no one stood to gain more than i did by killing them both  well im glad you can see where this is headed   ill need you to account for your whereabouts  now its just the protype  but ive never wanted to be a woman this badly in my life  okay can you try these on  i dont think thats appropriate  wait excuse me what  these are fabulous  now are we talking in your office or mine  okay back to work everybody  william order pizza for everybody  that yummy place with the soy ricotta  thank you  well this is my office so fire away  youve been head of this company for six hours  and youve changed just about everything  youre not exactly preserving the ciao legacy  you know i have all these things ive always wanted to do  and im turning the company green im ending animal testing  subsidizing proceeds to help find a cure for breast cancer  do any of those sound like bad things to you  unfortunately thats not an alibi  no it isnt  and whats more i dont think i have one  i mean i was with them all day every day  i see  well im sure you wont mind if i have a look around  and chat with a few of your employees  no of course not  thats it miss bloom  detective  arent you forgetting something  right  you know you have such great lines  theres no reason why you cant dress to arrest  is there  all right what do we know about emily bloom  well she wrote are you there god  its me margaret and freckle juice  i think that was judy bloom   then i got nothin  could you possibly be bringing less   to the table right now  shawn youre just upset because   im more than a pair of ankles  i dont get it  emily bloom was the vice president of the company  yet she was running coffee and balancing the books  dude are you oiling your head  lavender  berlinda likes her men to shine  chief  mr spencer im going to ask you a very important question   and id appreciate some candor  shoot  has your father lost his mind i mean why hasnt he called my friend susan back   honestly he should be so lucky  chief i cannot get involved  in some sort of soap opera starring my father   for the record  hold on  this is vick  he asked me out  wonderful oh my gosh what did he say   oh well he left a message  oh yeah that sounds like henry   dad  should i take her to crab shack willies   or the third wharf  those cant possibly be real places   look dad im really busy okay  do not bring your purse into the restaurant   shawn just pick a restaurant  listen im gonna call him back  okay call me later honey  i dont know where you should take her to dinner  hold on  thats her gotta go   he called her  he called her  now stop messing around and go find me a killer  goodbye   am i dreaming  nope  i just look this good  how is it possible that i am the only sane person   in the universe right now  question  do you think this shirt enhances or detracts from my traps  berlindas going to get me into the fashion show   have you worn that before  nope  this shirt was designed by gregor uwe steeb shawn  its a part of the new fall line  im only the head of the company  and after doing all the designs myself   these are really good  thank you  ive never really shown them to anyone before  that is not gregors design   what are you talking about  theyre stealing her designs   whose  emilys  gregor said he personally designed the whole new line  hes full of it thats emilys ive seen it  theyre all emilys  would you please put some pants on  the fish and chips is actually pretty good  ive been craving meat lately  well in that case the prime rib is excellent  byob help yourself   no no actually i dont think it is  is it hot in here  i dont think so its pretty comfortable  whew thats better  dont you think   what happened to you  i am a woman chief  and i am choosing to dress like one  you cant do that ohara  i paid for it myself i was feeling good about myself  it was my lunch break and  carlton is that a new tie  dont be ridiculous   i trust this is all in aid of something  yes chief  i spent the entire afternoon at ciao and i am certain  that emily bloom is not our killer  i grilled her she didnt break  not to mention she has over a dozen employees  that would take a bullet for her she simply doesnt have it in her  to kill somebody much less two somebodies id bet the farm on it  im sensing something  gregor and ciaobella were stealing emilys designs  stealing them passing them off as their own all the while treating her as a peon  thats not a bad start for motive  toxicology report ciaobella was poisoned  the only thing in her system were traces of arsenic soy milk  and green superfood powder  bad news jules  i think you just lost the farm  would you like me to butter your biscuit  excuse me  so whats it like working for the mayor  its okay  itd be more fun if he wasnt married though  so whats it like being retired  i mean youre not that old so whats the story  you take a slug  or did you just get tired of being good all the time  now be honest  isnt that better than some flaky piece of fish  thats good   very good  yeah  its good  oh damn it damn it  damn it i dropped my fork i  ill just get one myself  okay for the record i still dont feel right about this   dad i thought you were supposed to be  shawn i was wrong  shes like this carnivorous mink  she wants to eat me right here  that was weird  oh come on  so shawn  still feel like shes our killer  threedead bodies   detectives go call an ambulance  holy crap  shes stable now  theyve pumped her stomach i have a sample on the way to the lab  emily  black  whwhat are you doing here  its a long story that you dont really need to hear  how do you feel  not terrible i just i cant remember anything  that happened after i finished my dinner  dinner  what did you have  well the pizza was gone so i just had  a superfood smoothie and some tofurkey jerky   oh my god  what  i was really hungry   and i just wanted something quickly  no no no ive gotta go solve  im im im really glad  though that youre feeling that youre not um my name is   how bout i come back later  yeah id like that  sweet  gregor and ciaobella  im all over the second and third hows with these smoothies  all the models that would have benefited from killing gregor and ciaobella  have no reason to kill emily too i dont think   whats the missing link  right put a pin in it and ill make my move  on berlinda and well pick it up in the morning  only a few know that their actual wedding took place  in a private ceremony on the small bahamian island  of abaco two years earlier  today would have been their tenth wedding anniversary  did you know that  no shawn im not interested in learning new trivia   about our murder victims  ten years is a milestone  anniversary in this state gus financially its a benchmark  it means all the assets get split right down the middle  were not gonna solve this thing tonight shawn  i know part of it  i might even know 23 of it dude i could totally go up there   but you wont  all right spencer we did a rush tox screen on emily  you were right she had the same poison in her system as ciaobella   but in a much higher dose  i definitely know 23 of it  stop it shawn dont do it  dont just get up there and start winging it thats not how we operate  dude where have you been for the last two years  come on shawn im so close   would you tell us why were here  never afraid to take risks ciobellas dress  of electric lights set the paris   fashion world ablaze  oh my god  this is a doozy i mean wow  establishing her as one of the top designers working today  stop the projector  or or just keep it going thats thats fine  i know this may be hard for some of you to believe  but im not really black  and im not a model  my partner gus and i are detectives  youre not a model  im only a detective parttime  and my full name is tan gus  ciaobella masterson was murdered  by her husband gregor uwe steeb  wait wait wait  that doesnt make any sense  gregor was already dead  do i come down to your office and bother you while youre working  all the time  thats fair  gregor was having an affair  he couldnt chance getting caught not with his tenth wedding anniversary approaching  he was desperate to get out of the marriage without losing half of his company  so he poisoned ciaobellas green superfood powder  only she wouldnt die  because she was bulimic  ciaobella couldnt keep anything she ate down  thats why it took forever for the poison to take effect  all gregor could do was wait  he wouldnt even let me drink out of the same glass as her  and keep his vampire mistress away  from the poisonous elements  but ciaobella knew of the affair  and had herself a mind for murder  using her own skills with electricity  she laid a trap for gregor  before his plan was complete  whats up  what about emily  emily was drinking a superfood smoothie the day she took over  really jules   you too  im sorry  is this just a freeforall anybody can just bounce in anytime they want  im sorry  in summation ciaobella killed gregor  gregor killed ciaobella  emily got caught in the green powdery crossfire  but not before she designed the new fall line  its revolutionary by the way  we all deserve to feel beautiful  what am i supposed to do with these  nothing put em away  i guess what im saying is  youre all free to go  that was crazy right  you could have told me that over the phone  hell you couldve put it in an email  come on  dude did you see that  that was like the most stylish wrapup ever  except for the part where there was no one to accuse but whatever right  it was hot  gus  gus  all right here i am  why are you dressed like perry como   thanks for coming son  you said it was important  clearly youre about to shoot an old spice commercial  thats funny  look shawn i just i need to talk to you you know face to face  i got it youve been invited to a very special screening of bullitt  im going on another date with susan  what the woman you described as a carnivorous mink  ill admit her behavior threw me a little off balance  but the night ended up being a lot of fun  oh my god  you have a hickey  you called me over here to show off your hickey   thats sick  shawn no  no i called you over here because  i dont want to feel guilty about moving on with my life  your mothers not a part of it anymore she hasnt been for a long time she is not coming back  and i hope shes happy yeah i mean that  she deserves it but my life is here shawn  and i dont want to have to sneak around trying to live it   i cant deal with this right now  well shawn you have to  look i dont care what you do okay i dont care  i just dont want to hear about it so dont call me on the phone asking me for advice  and dont expect me to meet you and your new dominatrix girlfriend for dinner   kid this is not easy for me either  yeah it never was  have a nice date  and unless you plan on taking her to wayne manor  lose the turtleneck okay let her admire her work  and remember you treat a woman like a person and then a princess   and then a greek goddess  and then a person again  right  okay
