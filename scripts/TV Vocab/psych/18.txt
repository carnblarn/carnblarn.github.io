outside the hotel 0630   you werent there  yeah sorry  i got up early and went to go get coffee  son let me ask you a question  what made you think those 100 bills were authentic  um cause they said 100 on them  are you an idiot dont answer that  if i plopped a granny smith apple down on this counter  and carved a 100 on it would you accept that as legal tender  dont answer that do you know what microprinting is   im confused should i answer that  i know what it is  the introduction of microprinting as an antireplicant feature  began in 1990 with the addition of the words united states of america  printearound ben franklins lapel  in addition the words us 100 are printed  within the lines of the lower left 100  im sorry is it just me or is this unbearably boring  i dont know how ms leikin works but gus and i  are going to investigate the body of the store  and search for our culprits twisted wretched filthy aura  because that is what serious psychics do  shawn what are you doing   shawn  dad  wow you look so tiny down there  what the hell are you doing up there  what does it look like im doing were making a case   a federal one  oh of course you are  well when youve finished wrapping things up  for the pentagon i want you at my house i got a project for you  afraid were gonna be a little busy having our pictures  taken with the president of the united states of america  mm oh i think youll be there   you owe me  i owe you  yeah for the last 12 times i helped you solve one of your little cases   you agreed  gus did i agree to that  well technically i think you did  see ya   excuse me can i help you guys  hello garrison  were working on the counterfeiting case  and we need to see all of yesterdays security footage  how do you know my names garrison  you thought this was gonna be a problem  im sorry man i i didnt mean to freak you out  my name is shawn spencer im a psychic with the police department  there was already a psychic here last night from washington no less  she looked at all the tapes and there was no positive id  she already came here huh  and shes good she also knew my name was garrison  uh you mind if i take a peek anyway i work a little differently than her  my process is a little more complex  i can sometimes pick up images that are underneath the   epidermal layer  here it is  this is the tape of the counterfeiter that she looked at last night  you know honestly if that pretty lady psychic  couldnt pick up anything i cant imagine youre gonna have much luck  you know what youre probably right we gave it a shot  thanks garrison  tall short age race  do you mean to tell me that the only thing  you can remember clearly is that he was a man  and technically i cant even be sure of that now can i  wait im getting something   he did not wear corrective lenses  actually that is true  okay well thats something to go on good work mr spencer  great and so were looking for someone in santa barbara   who does not wear glasses  he he had a small scar  about three inches on the jaw line  and he wore a single stud diamond in his left ear  yes and yes  shes exactly right i can see that clearly now  thats why shes the best  tough break  wh jules  dad im confused there are plans for a wet bar  yeah thats right for entertaining  right but i dont see anywhere in the plans the portal into 1976  shawn a wet bar happens to be a timeless home feature  right perfect for those warm summer evenings when reggie jackson  and dyan cannon swing by for harvey wallbangers  shawn are you gonna crack wise or are you gonna get to work  i feel like it should be noted that neither gus nor myself   are licensed plumbers  yes i understand that shawn  ive already installed the sink  all you two have to do is connect the fittings  all right   lets get to work  seriously   this will be good  it will  work is good gus  work is glorious its the breath of life   what is this  its a drill  of course it is dont be ridiculous  youre still upset that lindsay showed you up at the crime scene arent you  what is her trick   maybe shes just more psychicy than you  gus dont be ridiculous   theres no such thing as psychics  i dont know shawn  even ive been getting a little bit of intuition lately  in fact im getting something right now something very strong  shes shes better than you  you know they say imitation is the greatest form  of flattery but that hurts   it hurts below the belt  shawn if you want to beat her  then we have to actually work the case  utilize my knowledge you know i have a coin collection  ive studied tender from around the world  i have over 85 buffalo nickels shawn  okay  first of all and this is key dont ever under any circumstances  ever admit that to anyone outside of these walls  secondly i love utilizing your knowledge gus  i cant wait until we have the case of the missing thimble  but this case is not about counterfeiting  its about me versus her ecks versus sever   joe versus the volcano  fine then lets get to it   what do you know  all right this is what i got  he managed not to be identified on any of the security cameras  which means hes smart  smart enough to stay ahead of the game  which means changing up anything that could be linked or traced to him  like his vehicle his key it was distinctively nissan  probably a murano maybe a sentra  so we go back and check the outdoor surveillance cameras  from the store and look for nissans   in the parking lot yesterday  yeah yeah yeah  i already tipped lassiter off to that  the only one that didnt check out was a new one with no plates  ewings informational packet links this guy  to over a dozen vehicles since he left washington  his patterns to spend six to eight days  in a town before pricking up ears   you read ewings informational packet  cover to cover  thats weird i just read the cover  but i dont need to read the whole thing  to know that thats his mo  hes too smart to still be driving that car gus  hes gotta be switching out his mode of transportation   on a daily basis  and paying cash  gotta launder as much of that funny money as he can  so the question is to which car dealership would a crook go  to spend lots of cash without pricking up ears  this must be what jay leno feels like when he walks  into his garage which makes you kevin eubanks  i dont think they roll around town together shawn   can we talk to the owner  first we play customer  its the people who groove on the floor that are gonna  give us the scoop gus  excuse me my buddy here is interested  in the bana yellow ferrari though hes neither gay nor european  i hope thats not a prob  look who finally figured it out  little late  how did you not notice her shawn   i wasnt expecting her to be here  you were looking right at her  shes got me all out of whack   get your head in the game  so whats going on  no one calls us anymore  thats the new thing i thought we were a team  yeah first of all the whole team thing  she wasnt talking to you and secondly ewing didnt call me  he called ohara   its not like i asked him to  its okay clarice   you dont have to make excuses to us  it wasnt just today  my phones been ringing all the time  i dont know how he got my home number i mean please  do you think i wanted to pick up my phone at 200 a m  and hear his voice all gravelly and masculine  probably called from the hotel  maybe just got out of the shower or finished with a swim dripping wet  just catch mr spencer and mr guster up  on what ms leikin was able to figure out  apparently our guy came in here bought a used lamborghini   for 47000 in cash  next day he tries to return it  all sales are final but the sales manager makes a concession  offering mere 26000 in cash  he accepts it what kind of idiot is this guy  a genius idiot according to the feds  you see those familiar with this sort of thing  know that its the classic grift  essentially he traded 47 gs of worthless paper  for 26000 in cold hard cash ive seen it before   where in a mamet play  any witnesses  no but a lamborghini was spotted outside of town  in goleta but it was moving too fast to make an id  you know i dont think hes a swimmer  hes not really that build i bet he plays rugby  hey what color is that suit   black  really   it seems blacker than black  its washington black  look if anyone wants to join me im gonna be taking a look  at some of the bills from the safe that didnt get deposited  look leikin i think its possible that we got off on the wrong foot   is that right  yeah i mean this is silly  we should join forces like pitt and jolie you know  work together make it nice for everyone  i dont think you get it i have nothing to gain here  if you havent noticed my job is safe  its you im worried about faker   in that case maybe we should just date  im seeing somebody   well is it  serious  yes   you didnt know i was gonna  yes i did  dude dont you know the move where you take off  your jacket and you lay it across some seats   get your head in the game shawn  uh budgies  these are good but theyre not great  you see how on this bill the edge of the nose on ben franklins cloudy  did you get that mildred  hey is there any reason a 100 bill would change colors  actually yes  its an effect caused by colorshifting ink  its only present in 100 bills  the changing color is called color diffraction  and its made possible when light reflects  off of metallic flakes added to the ink   good work gus  thank you  so well check the information that ms leikins gathered for us  thank goodness finally some nice seats huh  this is what im talking about  what  did i did i just sit in something   gus do i have pudding on my jeans  no no   nothing  shawn i think were not welcomed here  gus dont be a paranoid schizophrenic   were always welcome here  no look   oh my god were not welcome  its nothing personal mr spencer  special agent ewing just feels that ms leiken  has things covered on the psychic front  and i have to agree with him  okay take a hint  certainly dont need to be told twice  i think you were just told three times  you know what this is fine because we had a good run  thank you for the memories oh just one more thing  you might want to check the cash from the dealership  because its not all counterfeit  thats ridiculous  if i had learned how to laugh as a child i would right now  i looked at all those bills myself  do you really want to go against the leading special agent  in counterfeiting with 14 years of experience under his belt  and say that those bills werent fake  not all of them just one  and i believe the serial number was   ald 975 7080 7  7  where are we going  shouldnt we have stayed until they checked the bills out  wait for it  wait for it   spencer hold up  the bill checked out its real  all right answer me this mr psychic  why would a counterfeiter ever  use real bills  because he had to  man i read your informational packet cover to cover  our guy spends six to eight days in every city were only on day four  quite simply he ran out of dough  he didnt know what kind of deal hed be able to make on the car  turns out short one bill   lucky for us  so whats our next move  well ill call washington and begin  im sorry i was asking mr spencer  oh oh you want to know what i think his next move is  oh gus look she wants  well lets see here hes gotta print more money  my guess is he uh set up shop here in town  so we find his little nest we find him  well buddy i really hope you like this  it took me 19 hours to bake put it in last night before bed  it takes 19 hours to bake a pineapple upsidedown cake  it does when its being heated by a 60watt bulb  its not upside down shawn  who could that be at this hour  are you gonna invite me in  eh uh guess  so this is what a psychic detective office looks like  you know i always imagined it  does something smell like pineapple  pineapple upsidedown cake  would you like some wait  before you answer that are you a fan of delicious flavor  all right look  this isnt easy for me to say but  i was wrong youre better than i thought  your discovery at the station today was a huge get  i think we should work together after all  the faster we find out where the counterfeiters den is the better  that is if you guys are willing  i dont know  depends dont you think gus  wait im definitely getting something  oh this is good  its a its a its a transient location  uh where people can come and go anonymously paying in cash  and and its remote  so they can print large sums of money on a noisy printer without being heard   yes yes im getting that same thing  yes   and i see it  yes  its by a body of water  really its by a body of water  leikin thats amateur stuff  you know what i might expect that from john edwards  definitely from miss cleo but not from you   leikin  wait  im also im also getting something in french  a sign maybe   could it be a european hotel  wait a minute  she may be on to something  i know this particular hotel its on my sales route  on a private beach   what  its just its strange  im im pretty familiar with your route gus  i dont recall any private beaches with hotels on them   what are you talking about shawn  where was it you went last summer  for the pips autograph signing convention   you met gladys knight  no   just the pips  actually a pip  the other two got stuck in traffic look i dont wanna talk about it  the point is its been under construction for months  which would account for the noise and it caters to europeans   this could be the place  sweet we totally scored  but you couldnt have got that without my transient location thing am i right  i dont  i dont think that cake is cooked  listen i need to know every guest  cashed in the last week  im sorry who are you and what do you want  special agent lars ewing  federal treasury department  head detective carlton lassiter santa barbara police department  presidential recommendation for distinguished service  presidential physical fitness award  eighth ninth and tenth grade and ive got a cocktail napkin  from air force one  i personally arrested ivan boesky  i wrestled in high school   what with your conscience  that is it  look we need to know whos paid with cash or travelers checks recently  my god youre a firecracker  it would probably be easier to ask who didnt  im sorry  this is a hotel were a cash business lots of european travelers  with what foreign credit card companies charge these days cash is king  the south tower i see him  i see him in the south tower  how many rooms in the south tower  there are 170  all right lets start banging on some doors and call for backup  if we tap every available source of manpower  we can have this thing done  i can alert washington right now  and have an 80man swat team on a c130 hercules  they could be here in less than three hours  filthy sheets  i see dirty filthy sheets  yes and towels on the floor  and a mediocre halfeaten turkey club sandwich  and hes refused maid service  okay what guest refused maid service  i might remind you we do cater to a very european crowd  hes isolated  hes in a lessdesirable room thats not facing the ocean  do you have any rooms that face the parking lot  a few   hes in one of those  lets see  french woman  another french party  here heres a single gentleman  paid all in cash corner room facing the alley  and according to this hes never taken his do not disturb sign off his door   room number  key  clear  nice job psychics lets get to work  thats a really cute frontloader  thank you  he prints the money then he washes it here to soften it  then he tumbles it dry and beats it up with stones to give it that  natural worn texture  dude theres linen fibers in that paper  what was he doing amending the constitution  you cant print money on regular paper shawn thats governmentissue  im getting a visual  he printed a batch of about 50000 which will last him a while  five bills a sheet at least 80 sheets missing from this ream  that sounds about right  wait  no im getting more im getting a lot more  like 500000 which would last more than just a while  maybe maybe a whole lifetime   thats not possible  it is if you live in one of  the baltic states  im just not getting that feeling at all  anything over 50000 is just getting blocked from my receptors not a chance  receptors really  this would do it  this is a 500sheet ream and its likely he used it all  treasury seal  no  passport seal  uh this guys officially on the lam  we dont catch him now we can kiss him goodbye  the railway stations obviously the airport security has been notified  and all the interstate agencies are on alert  theyve all been given the sketch  based on ms leikins description of the suspect  okay but please keep your phones on just in case we get any movement  whats the point nobody ever bothers to call us anymore  shawn i dont do this much but i just wanted to say thank you  i know we havent nailed him yet but you were right we make a good team  yes we do  and hopefully tomorrow well wrap this thing up  have a good night  wait for it  wait for it  shawn i was thinking maybe we could go somewhere now  maybe continue working to see if we cant stumble upon some  collective apparition  thats a fantastic idea  i love it where could we go at this hour thats still open  you know what i think theres a color me mine that stays open late   you dont quit with the jokes do you  im sorry would you like me to stop  not yet i kinda like it  but actually i was thinking back to my hotel room  you know its something we could try  i mean its not as much fun as making ashtrays with our names on them but  yeah  im a flexible guy a sportsman  good  all right ill head back to freshen up what do you say we meet at 2200 hours  perfect oh im so rude  gus buddy would you like to join us   well i  that sucks  so 2200 on the dot ill be there  dude what time is 2200 hours  gus  buddy help me out  what is it is it like 1100 times two  buddy  so tell me shawn are you planning on doing psychic police work forever  no  no just until i find the girl of my dreams  and then ill whisk her off to carmel and  open a small haberdashery  do some macrame maybe  maybe blow some glass  well as hot as that sounds i think the psychic world would miss your talents  just make sure they appreciate you  after a while the world tends to take people with our abilities for granted  well thats awfully easy for you to say  i mean youve already met your special someone  your handsome prince  youre serious with somebody remember  actually i  recently had a change of heart  really  would a certain psychic have anything to do with that  well we do have quite a connection  we do its  its like our minds are just fused together you know  i feel like holly hunter in broadcast news you know  when shes inside william hurts head  okay lets try it  im thinking of something   none they dont bury the survivors  yes exactly  you have a favorite color and im seeing sea foam green  actually its blue but that is so near the green family   pick a number between one and ten  eight  thats close enough   you totally wanted me to do that  you totally read my mind  o dissolve the nerves that have just begun o  o listening to marvin o  o all night long o  o this is the sound o  o of my soul o  o this is the sound o  whoa slow down what do you mean she took off when  you know i dont know when she tricked me okay  she clearly wants to take all the credit for herself  look just just meet me over here  oh thats lassie on the other line i gotta take it   youre dropping me for lassiter  hurry up  you wait till now to call us  i called you as soon as i heard do you think i want  junior gman here to beat me to the punch  thank you  well its affirmative our counterfeiter  shot with his own gun there are signs of a struggle  checks out as steven j grabinski his only priors are a couple counts  of petty theft and smalltime fraud in washington  he had a small scar about three inches on the jaw line and  he wore a single stud diamond in his left ear  damn shes good  whoa touchy  i dont know how you do it in washington but here  we dont disturb the body till forensics has a chance to come in  collect some evidence  lassiter ease up  were lucky if our psychic doesnt lick the body  well  i guess congratulations are in order  we have to hand it to our federal agents here  though we would have preferred to bring him in and charge him  this case looks pretty much wrapped up  theres no need to congratulate us for doing what is our job  we dont ask for commendation for what is merely our proud honor  of servitude to our country  perhaps just a small hug  just an ittybitty one  im serious  too much  so howd you sleep  well i guess i was right about one thing  it turned out to be a pretty good week for you  look im sorry shawn  i dont know what you want me to say to you  i dont know either  you lost a case you lose  shes on the winning side youre on the losing side  shes the winner youre the loser  you know dad had i made a list of things i did want to hear  that wouldnt even have made the top eight  something is really off with this cake  but shawn you want my advice  i think you should quit   what  you should quit  thats what you do when things get tough  somebodys better than you you quit   where is this even coming from  oh come on shawn  ive got 80 examples sitting on the tip of my tongue  eighth grade you quit the bassoon when bobby nowocinski beat you out  for the solo in the winter festival  let me get this straight  you have an example from eighth grade sitting on the tip of your tongue  shawn the point is a year from now  you wont even be working for the santa barbara police department   you dont know that  all right look shawn  now im gonna tell you something that you do want to hear  i accept you for who you are   is that a fact  that is a fact  you dont have to prove anything to me im gonna let you off the hook  now hows that feel better  now you can go ahead and you can quit this too  first of all and i think i can say this now  with a fair amount of certainty  theres definitely something not right about this cake  maybe because it was baked with a childs oven  were talking about a deluxe easybake oven gus  i paid over 300 for it on ebay this is hardly a toy  okay i didnt major in psychology  but im gonna guess this doesnt have anything to do with the cake  im sorry  its got nothing to do with you or me or my dad or the cake  its got a little something to do with the cake  but its mostly about lindsay showing us up on this case  shes either a crazygood psychic  or shes just a better detective than me  hey i thought you had her back at the hotel  when you surprised her with that 500000 thing  im getting more im getting a lot more  like 500000 which would last more than just a while   maybe a whole lifetime  thats not possible  i did have her  i totally had her come on  mildred you kept a record of everything  that was said in this investigation am i right  if someone as little as burped i got it down   theres a symbol for burp  terrific  i need you to clarify something for me  two days ago in the morning outside the home depot center  ewing and leikin making small talk can you read that back   what was that 0700 hours  no no it was 700 a m  heres something  ewing do you know of a good chocolatier  leikin i had someone in seattle  specialized in hazelnut praline stuff very good   it was just after that  something about the dye  used in public swimming pools  to identify urine  no   the musical wicked  no   something about coffee  yes thats it  mildred could you read the coffee thing  ewing you breached protocol leikin  i waited for you outside the hotel  yeah sorry i got up early and went to grab coffee  mildred where are ewing and leikin now  where im supposed to be catching a chartered flight back to washington   im late  not a problem  well give you a ride we happen to be headed that way  thats great   mildred here say this  shotgun  tough luck buddy  well folks  you all did a nice job on this investigation  so uh  you have a myspace page or something  whoa lindsay lindsay lindsay  wait wait wait  i just wanted to make sure i had an opportunity to congratulate you  you know personally   thank you its not necessary  no no no it is necessary  you did it you cracked it  i mean you deserve all the credit youre amazing shes an amazing person  look shawn dont feel too bad   therell be other cases  yeah yeah i know i know  but not for you  you see  it all started when you identified the scar on the jaw line  of our counterfeiter along with his little diamondstud earring  i mean i couldnt even draw a hair color  so theres no way that you could do that unless  unless youd already seen him before   this is ridiculous  is it  its not like im wearing a giant moose costume  i had a vision you were drinking coffee   oh congratulations  but not at the hotel  you were driving past one starbucks two starbucks 17 starbucks  and ended up all the way in goleta  on the very same day that grabinskis lamborghini  was spotted just outside of town in anybody   special  goleta  thats right goleta  the two of you were partners and you were in touch the whole time  whats more they were lovers in the night  im seeing somebody  i didnt think it was possible to fall in love with somebody  in the span of five minutes  she got us so close to the counterfeiter a month ago in wilmette illinois  probably just missed him by five minutes  thats when you met him  you didnt miss him she had him  she had your bad boy redhanded  suddenly you were much more interested  in combining forces and making a whole lot of money  and it was going well  it was going very well  until you blew it  you know which moment im talking about right  the one in the hotel room when you realized  he had printed way more than the 50000 that youd planned  and the passport  so you called him that morning you met him at the warehouse  it was you who struggled with him  and it was you who shot him dead  only then having your vision  that miraculously led everyone here to the crime scene  oh come on i mean ive seen poor losers before but this is just sad  your dna was all over him  but you covered your tracks by touching the body in front of everybody  before forensics had a chance to come in and brush it  or comb it  braid it   maybe put it in pigtails  shawn  that only leaves one outstanding issue  and that is wheres the rest of the money  wait a minute  whats happening  whats happening to me  ive heard about this  its called spontaneous psychic
