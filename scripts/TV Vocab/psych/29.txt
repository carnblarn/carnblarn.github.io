part of this place anymore  and whe ther or not this was murder you are he reby ordered to steer clear  these guys are not to be messed with  i cannot possibly be more serious about this  tuesday at 1100 is perfect  ill be there with bells on  okay  dude who says that  closers  closers say that  well if by closers you mean middleaged women then  yes i do believeive heard the phrase  are you for getting that we many have stumbled up on a murder today  a murder that youre taking entirely too unseriously  the mans name was arthur holmstrom  and he died during the sacred star ceremony  get over here look at this  its weird  weird  those guys look down right evil white men in hoods   dude theyre violet  thats how it starts shawn  do you see that  holy crap shawn your dad was right  its one of those scary lodge guys  theyre here for us they know you think they killed that guy  lassie  what are you doing here  i think you know why im here  hope fully youre here to help gus and i were about to do some scrap booking  well need someone who can work the scalloped scissors  spencer i get why you have to act like an ass at my station  but do you have to act like this in your own office  it enhances my perception  how else would i know that you came here because you think arthur holmstrom  was murdered  no ones talking down at the lodge  i was just driving by the office and saw the lights on  you want to hire us  come on lassie its not that tough let it go   lass come on  look around  youre in a safe place surround ed by men  who love you  gus  lassiter i love you  look  you have a connection in there  so i need you to feel around and see what you canfind out  the departments hiring us  not the department me and i cant pay you  well that sounds worth while  i guess this would technically be called a  favor  maybe i could pay your expenses  done   when were finished we all go for a picnic  this is a discreet investigation  id like to show you something  see this  its the lodge radar  and look at this  its me  flying under neath it  now look down here  its gus  he cant fly  it is imperative that you keep a low profile  place the robeon our new brother  thats it im official  no brimstone  i dont have to crab walk or get tickled with a feather  come on somebody tickle me with a feather you  gentlemen to the bar  yes  save me a shot  dont you think its odd that its just businessas usual  when someone died here the other day  definitely  it appears as though hes been all but forgot ten look  holmstroms already been moved  those paintings are in order of rank  once the high most patriarch moves on hes replaced by the next guy in line   thats irving parker  right  holmstrom was fifth in line  some how he leap frogged three other guys  in cluding parker and two of your doctor buddies    15 grand for clothing for kids  these guys are ultraphilanthropists  theyre the most charitable organization in the city  why would they commit murder  well maybe it was for the kids  the shroud of charlemagne   dude holmstrom was wearing this hood the day he died  check it out its 100 years old  like a lot of the guys around this place  sorry   what  nothing  thank you  shawn  you know my newest clients  dr masood nigam and dr roger downs  yes yes i do  congratulation son your client ship  just youre in good hands with gus  nimble agile hands  surgeons hands really  he once removed a boil from his own thigh  using a paper clip and a warm can of sprite  dude when did you have time to make all these sales  we were in there for an hour  an hour is all you need shawn when youve got sales reptitude  dr mccormerly can i talk to you for a second  youre calling me a day after our first date you really are out of practice  so whatd you find out  well it appears our victim made top dog with very little effort  one day he was fifth in line for the job the next day he was high most patriarch  and the next day he was dead  does anyone suspect you  no members are beyond suspicion  members  sweet justice they made you a member  now dont get all mad lassie  there was a 15minute waiting period  i finally learned the lyrics to informer while they convened and agreed on me  let me give you my card dr mccormerly cause you do not want to miss out  on this baby  are you staking me out  no   yes you are  no im not  i can sense youre right around the corner  whoa youre breaking up can you call me back lassie  i dont have time for this ive got another call  ohara finally  where are you  im at lunch  get me a turkey and avocado   let me talk to her  hands off   is someone there with you  hi jules   spencer  youre having lunch with shawn   maybe  is something going on  look do you have the toxicology reports on holmstrom or not  yeah but theyre inconclusive well   actually theyre just strange  strange how  oh come on  well it doesnt look like natural causes and his blood had trace elements of  i dont even want to say  come on ohara  well it had what looks like the toxin similar to the venom of a  brazilian vine snake  youve gotta be kidding me   he got bit by a snake  am i on speaker phone  no   well then how did he hear  jules how bout you just tell us  he didnt have a mark on him there werent any puncture wounds  the only thing he had was a little skin irritation on his face  obviously these results are inconclusive so run the tests again  because we need results that arent ridiculous  i dont know lassie i kind a like this snake idea  why are you sharing information with shawn on a case we havent hired him for  you know what ohara you breaking i call you back  nice  you joined the lodge  what can i do dad im a legacy its in our blood  damn it shawn im not kidding youve gott are consider this  you get a lot of power ful people in to one room and dangerous things happen  would you please let the police just do their job   i am working for the police  sort of  its a discreet investigation   yeah discreet thats one of your talents  im working on a theory  arthur holmstrom was poisoned with snake venom   snake venom  the brazilian vine snake  specific to remote river basins in nor thern brazil  about two to three feet in length  so someone snuck a threefoot snake in to the lodge and killed him  during the ceremony   the perfect crime  right  except there were no marks left on the body  so were looking for an invisible snake  you know shawn thats it rightright there  that is your problem  maybe youd be better off looking for something that you can see  there is a pecking order right in front of your eyes  dad youre gonna ruin my diagram  yep whos at the top  whos the next guy in line  i know where the top is you could have just pointed now theres  coke all over everything  forget it just grow up  me grow up a grown man makes a crawly snake  this is parkers place  i can see the sign shawn  well i bet theyre very busy inside  might i suggest coming back this evening and breaking in  good idea  let me see what im doing for the next three to five years  with time off or good behavior  were here now i can get us in  all of a sudden you can just get us in  shawn im totally in a sales zone this week  you leave this secret hand shake to me  im not showing an appointment mister  guster burton guster  and this is my associate william zane  im an old friend and im just paying mr parkera birthday visit  its not his birthday  i know its mine  were here on lodge business  thats a three right there  what  nothing better to do on your birthday  well its my 29th not one of the important ones  youll

birthday thats your sales reptitude   it comes in all flavors shawn  is suck a flavor  dude  the worlds very first crockpot  what the hell are you guys doing here  mr parker its me shawn spencer   im the newest monarch remember  yeah i remember  so what the hell are you guys doing wandering around my ware house  this is my very good friend gus hes looking to join the monarch lodge too  i thought maybe you could make that happen you know haze him a little bit  soak his hand in warm water while hes sleeping that sort of thing   do you have any sheep here  this is not a lodge  this is my place of business  and the fact that you slid into member ship on the coat tails of your turn coat dad  that doesnt guarantee any favors from me  now im through talking to you nicely  i want you to turn around and get the hell out of here  right now   im surprised he didnt say good day   whats that  i said good day  dude did you see those shipping crates  cci  aif  xap  those are airport codes all brazilian  brazilian airport codes how do you know that   i lived in an airport for a month gus  that was tom hanks in the terminal  same difference we need to talk to lassiter  no you need to talk to lassiter ill drop you off   where are you going  i have appointments with four new clients  and product doesnt sell itself  man  lassie  anything  well ive got good news and ive got bad news  the good news is we found a pretty solid suspect on the holmstrom murder  finally well who is it lets go get him   thats the bad news  that is ridiculous  whos in charge here huh  ill tell you this i better be home for dinner  heads are gonna roll thats all i got to say  heads are gonna roll  oh no  do not go down that road  look im not happy about this either lassie  now that ive joined the lodge that makes your fatherinlawmy brother  which makes me your uncle  inlaw its gonna get especially awkward around the holidays  spencer you cant seriously suspect parker  unfortunately it sort of checks out  if it was venom that killed holmstrom it came from a snake  that only slithers in a region where parker does half his business  hes in room a whos going to question him  i will  carlton do you really think this is a good idea youre related   its against department policy  ohara quiet im gonna handle it  dont you dare tell the chief  i cant believe this is happening  lassiters desk  its your wife  i mean your exwife  hey  yeah well it seems that irving is kind of a  well hes a murder suspect  yes  no this is not because i want the barbecue  i already gave you the golf clubs   so howd he go  not quietly  you ever meet his wife  no and if shes anything like her dad i dont want to  okey doke  that seems fair  ohara please go down to the room ill be down in a minute  spencer i want you to listen to me and listen closely  i know irving parker very well and he wouldnt kill anyone  sure he might hobble their spirit and crush their soul  and dance in the flaming ashes of their broken marriage  which he had a partin ending but he wouldnt kill anyone  look hes the only suspect we have  he tried to hate me to death  i know its circumstantial but in a pretty bad way  i know and im going to go treat him just as i would any other suspect  but i think holmstroms murderer is still out there just just workshop it  do what ever it is you do because at the end of the day  it absolutely cannot be him  workshop it  four five six seven eight  i dont know if reverse engineering the case was such a good idea  did its won 12zip  but lassiter said he was sure that parkers not our guy  well the board seems to disagree vehemently  fine then lets move away from him and check out the other lodge members   what do we know about holmstrom  holmstrom  we know hes dead thats a good start  im serious shawn i was in that lodge making contacts  i know you have sales reptitude  now can we please retire that expression  throw it a party put it on medicare its just not working anymore  no shawn what im saying is those other lodge members were hardly over whelmed with grief  even as holmstrom lay on the floor i was shamelessly moving my product  and no one see med to think anything of it   id say holmstrom had some enemies  well we gotta figure out who they are  and how do we do that  theres something much more important we have to do first  tobias ive heard the canvasadds ten pounds is that accurate  maybe you could paint some angry tigers or a puma  laying prostrateat my feet  this is a portrait of your head  i thought we were here to find something about holmstrom   we are this is for posterity   dont worry youre next  he doesnt get one hes not a member yet  maybe we could paint him in the background of mine put his head in the pumas mouth  youre going to ignore that  heywhy did they take arthur holmstroms painting down so quickly  all of his things were taken over to his house  do it lightly  say what you will about credit cards and paper clips  sometimes a door just needs to be owned   thats a screwdriver shawn  screwdrivers too  i think it was unlocked   it was not unlocked  i think it was  the door was most definitely not unlocked  gus the man was a widower nobodys here  why dont you let me use my new contacts to get the information  is that how we do things gus really why talk to someone about holmstrom  when we could have his home office tell us everything we need to know  his hopes his dreams   his love for the ladies  i think thats his wife  people lie stuff doesnt   did you lock the front door  yes i locked the door  i dont think it was locked i know i lock  you see that they had to break a window  burn  no  i just tried that well i did it in a different spot shawn  hes coming hes coming coming coming  watch out  people breaking into offices no one respects anything anymore  my god did you see who that was  its hard to see anything with someones knee in your eye  its your own knee get out of here  look at this place  whoever was here wasnt invited either  a secret safe   dude you gotta get us in there  i cant get us in that safe shawn  thats a martin 16  youre 36 months into a subscription to modern safecracker magazine whats the point  im an amateur shawn   well its timet o go pro fingers  fingers  twist it up  watch out  would you stop it  now ive gotta start all over  this month would be good   its not happening shawn  try 362436   are you serious  just click it in gentle  that was a good idea now what  i really thought i nailed that  shawn youve really gotta work on your estimating skills   dude  youre a safecracking machine   i know  grab that  all right ive got 25 000 for komputers for kids  this one says 35 000  one of these books is a fraud  dude holmstrom was skimming funds from the lodge  and look hes writing in some secret ancient code  no this isnt code theyre abbreviations  hx means history qd means every day c means and  deposit history follow up with accounts every day transfer and with drawals    youre telling me you can read this  of course i can this is doctors shorthand  and this is doctors handwriting  see these sticky notes holmstrom wrote these  he wasnt skimming he figured out who was  one of the doctors is cooking the books   how sure are you  85 86  weve gone on much less  look irving its been four hours  is that all  you know carlton it may be the rage talking  but if i had it to do over again the day my tory came home with you  i would have told her to go right back out that door  and come back alone   thats what i should have done  all right irving thats enough  now i loved victoria and because she loved you  i let it slide that youre a pain in the ass  but youre at my table now and around here we call someone like you a hostile witness  its a good way to get yourself locked up  i can make your life a living hell  so you better give me the respect i deserve and i suggest you cut the crap  clear  i want a straight answer and i want it immediately  how did arthur holmstrom advance to the highmost patriarch  when you were the next in line  well i dont know how artconvinced the other guys  he asked me and i said it was okay  he was a friend of mine and he had health problems he was getting worse  and i gave him the only chance hed probably ever get  now as for the snake business i havent traveled abroad in over three years  i havent been out of the country since you got married  doctors orders are we done  were done when i say were done  were done  you can go  weve been to four doctors offices none of the hand writing matches the books  plus i probably caught something from somebody and im tired  of reading high lights for children they always hide the apple in the bike  can you man up shawn is that possible  im on an unbelievable hot streak right now and im not about to ruin it  its good to know that moving oozing infection gel is more important than finding a killer  hey maybe we could park on a steeper incline next time  my quads arent burning enough  tell heather to call back tomorrow  yes  good afternoon  im burton guster with central coast pharmaceuticals  were closed  yes well im here to drop off some product to dr downs  hes a brother of mine   he isnt here at  well he was expecting me  you can leave your card  i just thought id drop by and pay him a birthday visit  its my birthday the big twonine  remember that one  im 26  really  so  will dr downs be here later  i will make sure he gets this  and look hes writing in some secret ancient code  dude i just solved it  call lassie  ohara  right   to absent friends  to absent friends  absent friends  like arthur holmstrom  what  my sweet violet brothers we congregate here today in the flesh  not only to recognize our new highmost patriarch irv parker  but also to bear witness  along with the magic head of gus the wisdom of baum  and that  that stuffed creature  arthur holmstrom was murdered  duck duck duck duck duck  duck duck duck duck duck  goose  dr roger downs  entrusted  with the proceeds of charity activities was funneling funds into his own pocket  and covering his tracks by using a dummy accounting ledger  now when holmstrom discovered the corruption  he confronted downs and made a play for the highmost patriarch position  in exchange for his silence holmstrom got what he wanted  but downs still couldnt chance getting caught and so he killed  his own lodge brother right here  on the eye of hathor in the middle of the lodge  and this  is the murder weapon  how dare you accuse me  i am a respected officer of this lodge  by the shores of gitchagoomee i can see you in the house  frantically searching for the ledgers that holmstrom kept securely stored in his safe  ironically to keep you good to your word  arthur holmstroms death was  unfortunate but i had nothing to do with it  check it out lassie  im quite certain youll find traces of a powdered form of  the venom of the brazilian vine snake  native to brazil  its part of an antivenom that dr downs uses in his charitable work abroad  who knew that in small doses  it acts as a vaccine while larger doses are absolutely lethal  i did   really  this is absurd  holmstrom died of natural causes  by the halls of montezuma  i see you taking great care to put on protective gloves  while lining the inside of the hood with the powder  for holmstroms patriarch ceremony  making it deadly venomous  the poor old mans head and face never stood a chance  not too keen on the hippocratic oath are we rog  i have nothing to say  speak to my lawyer  hold it right there dr downs youre under arrest  and none of this your highmost  would have been discovered with out the intrepid police work  of one detective carlton lassiter  santa barbara police departments own  highmost patriarch  nice collar detective  its all in a days work irving  you may t be my soninlawmuch longer  but im thinking you might be a monarch yet  hey you ready to go   what could you possibly mean by that  our big weekend remember  i cancelled i felt bad so i just thought wed go this weekend  dad  i wish youd given me a little bit of advance notice im im swamped here  yeah right  all right look im gonna go you want to come along youre welcome  whoa dad wait a second  theres still something that doesnt make any sense to me   why did you leave the lodge  look shawn its not important let it go  come on you big liar throw a little truth on the barbie see if it stinks   what are you talking about  im talking about man candor  lets have some  all right all right you want some man candor you want the truth  my marriage was falling apart and i made a choice a stopped caring about the lodge  because i realized the only real member ship that mattered  was family  there  family  you really expect me to believe that  what the hell is that  this you gotta see  nice addition dont you think   we grabbed em on our way out of the lodge  way out  yeah gus and i decided we didnt want to belong  to a club that would have lassiter as a member  you can have yours if you want it  nah  no i think it should stay right where it is  that way i can always keep an eye on you
