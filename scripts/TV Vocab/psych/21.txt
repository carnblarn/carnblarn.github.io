you  dont hide gus in the pantry  no a lie always leads to more lies  instead of lying to me about baking these yourself  and then lying to me about your secret ingredients  that you put in you should have just said that gus  baked these muffins and i might have let you off the hook   who said gus made them  go to your room   i dont know where that is  shawn  whos shawn  public parking huh  nice to know that my first visit to santa barbara  isnt a good enough reason for you to pop for a couple  of extra bucks for the valet  the restaurant doesnt have valet parking uncle burton  am i gonna need

sorry shawn i cant make it  for crying out loud burton the cops are handing you a case  youve gotta take it youre the only psychic detective theyve got   thats very funny  dont speak   just one minute  yeah  i know what youre thinking  of course you do youre a psychic detective  a few months ago i was on the phone  with my great aunt whos hard of hearing and pretty much out of it in general  i told her i was working parttime at a psychic detective agency  she mustve misunderstood because now everybody  on my moms side of the family thinks that im a psychic detective  and youre gay   no  german   no  invisible  my assistant shawn   gus this is uh  wow i know its a mess  why dont you just tell him it was a simple misunderstanding  its too late  i cant come clean now without everyone thinking  that i lied to them in the first place  plus uncle burton has had it out for me ever since he started going by gus  even though im names after him  if he figures out that im not psychic hes gonna make it his mission   to destroy me in front of everybody  all right say no more   youre not getting destroyed by that man  im getting hungry over here   dont worry i have a plan  you do  uncle burton  how would you like to come with us and watch your nephew in action  tag along with you guys on a real detective case yeah  hey maybe this wont be the most boring vacation  in the world after all maybe  i cant wait to watch you work your psychic magic  psych 206  meat is murder but murder is also murder  o i know you know o o that im not telling the truth o  o i know you know o o they just dont have any proof o  o embrace the deception o  o learn how to bend o o your worst inhibitions o  o tend to psych you out in the end o   so how you feeling buddy a little nervous  feel something happening in the belly  maybe you should do some of your lamaze breathing  no you know why shawn  because your little plan to embarrass me isnt gonna work  as soon as the cops see uncle burton hanging around  theyre gonna kick him right out nice try shawny boy   hey guys  ah buzz  you know im not sure theyre gonna want you having any guests in here  i mean since its a crime scene and all   no its not  its not  no theres no crimescene tape at the door  the forensic guys are not collecting any evidence  and it seems as though you guys dont suspect foul play  so ive got as much right to be here as you do  and dont give me any of that fancy police talk please  ive seen enough hill street blues to know whats what  i gotta go  hey thanks for coming so quick whos this  this is my uncle burton from new jersey  shawn invited him  very nice to meet you uncle burton  his mother named him after me  its not a very common name but some of us still use it proudly  jules whats the skinny what do you got  vince wagner longtime restaurant critic  at the santa barbara mirror died suddenly after eating  his wifes chicken soup all signs point to natural causes  but the wifes acting a little suspicious  i want to make sure i didnt miss anything  so id like for you to get a reading on her   then thats what we will do  shes in the den  finally a chance to see gus psychic powers at work  shawn can i speak to you for a second   what is the problem here  stop playing shawn  you know i cant do this   yes you can  no i cant  you make some observations you form a conclusion  and you reveal it to everybody in a ridiculous andor roundabout way   what are you talking about  ill show you  raw chicken next to vegetables charred pots and a refrigerator  full of takeout containers  what does that tell you about the wife  i dont know she sucks at cooking   oh youre on fire  what  uncle burton come quick its happening  shawn stop it stop playing  put your hand to your head it really helps sell the thing  im not doing it shawn  this better be worth skipping dinner for  hes a psychic wildebeest  im im seeing something  im sensing something  im tasting something  it tastes bad   shes a bad cook  you sound just like my husband  mrs wagner oh please excuse my partner  his psychic visions are often terribly impolite  no need to apologize  i really am a terrible cook  im very sorry for your loss  im sensing that youre at peace with your husbands passing  well not exactly at peace  but it wasnt easy being married to a food critic  he graded everything i did  surely he couldnt have graded everything  i never broke two stars  well thats   awfully harsh  so why did you keep on cooking for him  health reasons he had gotten a worrisome checkup  from his doctor recently he ate out every day  for his job and always brought the leftovers home so  i started making him healthy homecooked meals just once a week  thats what dinner was tonight  thank you for your time mrs wagner you have our condolences  she didnt kill him  if she wanted him dead she wouldnt have cooked him   healthy meals once a week  great lets just tell the police  and get uncle burton out of here before they ask us anything else  check it out  i went to candy emporium this time for research  there are over 100 flavors of lollipop on the market  not one of which turns your tongue black   can you believe that  what are you talking about  right before we left i caught a quick glimpse of the critics mouth  his tongue was coated black  now what else could possibly cause something like that  bismuth subsalicylate  that dude that used to play for the mavericks  no shawn its the active ingredient in those pink stomach medications  he mustve had some look lets talk about this later my uncle is  gus the critic was murdered  i thought you said the wife didnt kill him  she didnt he was complaining of an upset stomach before dinner  he asked for chicken soup  thats the ultimate im feeling sick meal  except of course for a tub of bacon grease and hotdog water   but usually  shawn this place is a sty  maybe you ought to tidy up once in a while huh  or did you forget that youre the assistant  you are absolutely right sir  the person whos not the psychic detective should be in charge  all the cleaning it just makes sense  meanwhile gus here has new psychic knowledge about yesterdays case   yeah  no i dont shawn  i mean i shouldnt spent so much time working   when ive got family in town  oh dont be ridiculous burton  you think diagnosis murder ever let family get in the way of his work  another excellent point i bet diagnosis murder never did that  go ahead gus call up on the spirits  ask them what happened to the dead critic  fine  o oh spirits always willing o o to lend a helping hand o  this psychic stuff can get a little wimpy huh  at least hes not doing it in the tutu and capezios  i asked you to help me solve the murder of vince wagner  show me what transpired  im seeing something  im seeing  im seeing  i dont know what im seeing  wait wait  its coming clearer now  somebody put something in his food  at a restaurant  and that is what made him sick  sick to the point of having a seizure  no no no  thats what killed thats what killed his nose  what   thats what killed him  whoo gus  you are so amazing with that stuff  if it wasnt for his psychic talents id have to get some lame job  at a pharmaceutical company or something  that happens to be a very exciting industry shawn  now lets go and tell the police our new revelation  uncle burton wait here  no way if i wanted to sit alone in a dirty room id have stayed at home with my wife  im going with you guys  killed his nose you went like this  how do you kill a nose  shawn that visitors badge is not gonna hold him up for long  i cant be psychic in front of the cops  dont worry i have a plan  im gonna go in vicks office you wait here   for what  my signal  the stuff you did in the office genius all of it  but i wanted you to say poison gus poison   get it right this time  this time  shawn what are you about to theres no time to explain  ham pencils  sheila e tomato bark velvety shark toast  shark toast  is there something wrong with you mr spencer  you picked today to ask him that question  dude lassie what happened to your arm   i dont want to talk about it  he wont tell us either  and what were you saying when you came in   i couldnt understand any of it  oh jules its this case  these visions im having theyre so intense  i cant even describe them  every time i open my mouth the wrong fishes come out   you mean words  isnt that what i said oh no  if only there were someone here that could translate  you know someone whos known me so long they understand everything i say  someone just slightly less handsome than i am  gus perfect this is perfect   gus gus get in here  what  oh mambo beef puddles swirlywhirly jungle pants  quick translate that into normal words for us  man they made me fill this thing out for six pages of paper work  and they didnt put my picture on it   sorry who are you  dont ask anymore questions  no one concentrate gus tell us that all this means  swirlywhirly jungle pants  it means the critic ate something he wasnt supposed to   two bones and a skull  two bones and a sku poison  yes the critic was poisoned  man this is better than ghost whisperers  guys we checked the wifes soup its clean  and am i now supposed to believe that guster here   carnival stud muffin huh  what  it wasnt the wife the critic was poisoned at a restaurant  now that makes sense  wagner was pretty harsh on his own wifes cooking  he was probably even harder on the restaurants he reviewed  he could have easily been poisoned by a chef who got a bad review   do you think so  yes yes yes  okay  call the lab i want a tox report on my desk asap  youre actually listening to this  well weve gotten information in stranger ways before  never hurts to check it out  burton that was fantastic how do you do that stuff  he cant talk tight now uncle burton  psychic episodes like that leave him very very parched  no no no let me get you some water  down those stairs around the corner  thank you what do we do now  weve gotta figure out what that critic ate  if he was poisoned by a chef it had to have been something  he consumed in the 24 hours leading up to his death   how do we do that  well wagners wife said  he brought all of his left overs home right  the refrigerator was packed with takeout containers  the one on top was probably the most recent  the restaurant it came from was   the curvy a  the curvy a  that doesnt sound like a place that serves food shawn  its not the name its the symbol on top of the box  come on man you eat out all the time  what place has a big swoopy curving a  i dont know what does it look like   antonios  sweet   why did you write on my hand  why would i write on my own hand   this thing is totally permanent  wha shawn  lets make this quick before uncle burton starts thinking  of sticking em with the check  fire up the entrees for the eighttop  mario where are my starters hurry up  hey chef antonio  wed like to ask you a couple questions  sorry guys no customers allowed in the kitchen okay  no were not customers  were from the health department here for a surprise inspection  again we just had the surprise inspection a few days ago   why is there a problem  yes   you werent surprised enough  lets make this quick  walls and the floor are clean drainage is clear  hand washing station is stocked with soap and clean towels  dry food storage over there walkin freezer over here  looks good  arent you supposed to check the temperature  of course gus go ahead check the temperature   me why do i have to do it  dude im wearing short sleeves  so did you hear what happened to the food critic down at the mirror   thats some nasty business huh  sure i heard about wagner  i dont say im sad  ten years ive been working in this town that man never gave my food  a good review  sounds like youre not very fond of the guy  vince wagner made my life miserable with his asinine reviews  honestly i am glad that that bastard is dead  chef antonio  youre under arrest for the murder of vince wagner   take him  murder  is this a joke i   who put you up to this  jules whats going on here  tox screen came back positive  apparently wagner ate a poisonous mushroom called the death cap  what are you saying  there were death caps in the mushroom risotto  wagner ate here the day before he died  we found the leftovers in his fridge  looks like you were right shawn or gus  or whoever  what a relief we caught the guy we solved the case  and best of all i dont have to be psychic anymore  what  we got the wrong guy  guys its not that complicated  whenever a critic eats at his restaurant   antonio prepares the meal himself  not this time  the mushrooms in the takeout container we cut into cubes  antonio cuts his mushrooms into strips  lassie i have a really strong vibe he didnt do this  look we know antonio hated wagner  wagner died from eating his risotto we have the risotto  we even have wagners notes proving he ate the risotto  its a slam dunk  thats wagners notebook it says the risotto was cold   so  so  whoa the sandpaper with the bana patch  i think he means the risotto was cold   thank you gus  youre welcome  why would food be served cold at a fivestar restaurant unless  unless the poisoned food was cooked somewhere else  you know what i think  case is closed  hey guys i want to thank you for an incredible day burton  youre a regular rockford files  did my uncle just thank me for an incredible day  a more important question how much tv does he watch  im serious shawn  my cousin took him to the super bowl on a helicopter  and he never even thanked him for that  im serious too hes like this crazy tankshaped encyclopedia of detective shows  i be he even saw manimal   youre right  about manimal  shawn we have to solve this case before he leaves   why  because i think ive finally  figured out how to get back on his good side  ive been seeking uncle burtons approval all my life  hes mean to everybody  but ever since he started tagging along on this case  hes been kind of nice to me you know why  you dont have the braids anymore  he likes detective shows if i could solve this case  before he leaves he may finally get over the whole gus burton thing   but im gonna need your help  all right fine mr psychic detective  tell me since antonio clearly didnt kill the critic who did  i dont know  maybe we should find out if anyone else hated him   see who else may have had a motive  what  youre gonna start a crimefighting revolution with talk like that  shawn you say stuff like that all the time  phil pritikin mr editorinchief  shawn spencer  longtime reader firsttime caller  whats going on with the sunday spread  layouts waiting for your approval on the mockup  mockup funny word like i was saying   where salazars alderman story  shes typing it up   do you want copy to read it first  no just send it straight here  anything else  you know phil now that you mention it i would very much like   does he work here  i dont believe so sir  son im a busy man  if you dont work for me i dont have the time  i just have a question about vince wagner  cooper these guys got questions  oh i also have an idea for a crossover strip  where dilbert finally meets marmaduke  did you guys need something  hi im burton guster with the sbpd  were investigating the murder of vince wagner  im cooper i was mr wagners assistant  great maybe you could help us out  do you know of anyone who may have had a grudge against your boss  are you serious  we call them the angry chef letters every chef who ever got a bad review  would write a nasty letter to mr wagner about it  so youre saying this is all hate mail  i dont know if id call it all hate mail  it ranges from mild dislike mail   to extreme abhorrence mail  how about i wish you were dead mail  oh we have those too back here  any one of these chefs could have cooked the poison risotto  and snuck it into antonios restaurant  youre right we should talk to all these chefs before they open for business  call the restaurants and make a reservation   for justice  is justice the time   or the number of people in our party  just call em  and make it for three uncle burtons coming  all right  so what did you think of vince wagner  looky here he was a jackass  you know what he called my awardwinning jambalaya  jumbalousy  now tell me if this aint the best damn jambalaya youve never had in your life  you know what he wrote in his review of my famous miso yellow tail roll  miso disappointed  dont laugh its not funny  no its not  lets put it this way  he once referred to my white chocolate tiramisu   as ass cake  oh now that just seems mean  i didnt kill him i was here that night cookin  had a bunch of big groups never even left the kitchen  i was either in the kitchen or out here talking to customers  i own this place i have to watch over everything  every bowl every noodle every chopstick  i didnt kill him i definitely thought about it a couple of times  i could never figure out why that guy was so angry  he ate out at fancy restaurants all the time for free  and still all he did was complain  ask her some more questions maybe shell give us some cookies  im confused why are you here  wagner never even reviewed my restaurant  oh make it right there it is  that was without question the tastiest deadend we have ever gone down  well at least it wasnt a complete waste of our time  it seems to me like any of these chefs were way to busy to murder the critic  matlock never ate this good  im going back to the car an unbutton my pants  you know ive been thinking about what that dessert chef said  wagner got to eat out at fancy restaurants  every day on the newspapers dime if i was him id be happy  i mean who wouldnt want to have that job  thats a good point  thats a really good point gus  i think youre right we were wrong about the chefs  maybe this wasnt about revenge at all maybe this was about  somebody wanting the restaurant critics job   someone who works at the newspaper  exactly  we need to get down there and talk to the editor  wait wait shawn hes not gonna talk to us  he doesnt talk to anybody who doesnt work for him  i dont think that will be a problem  okay i think i have something here  you sir are lefthanded  you have a new baby at home  you just covered a story somewhere in the midwest  and you you just really really need to pee  just go  all right you convinced me  congratulations youre our new astrological forecaster  now get out of here youve got a

keep it quiet though  every single person who works here  is playing some sort of angle to get the restaurant critic job  sir meeting in five  you know these cheetos are so crispy yet airy  and its subtle flavor is such a  wonderful contrast to its eyecatching color  i get it  every day with the cheetos  shawn  there is 100 applications in here  thats 100 suspects my uncles flight leaves today  we dont have time to talk to 100 people shawn  we dont need to we just need to talk to the one guy  that can link one of those people to the murder weapon  and whos that  delicious  are you sure about this guy  hes the only mushroom farmer in the tricounty area  if anyone can help us he can  mr mooney thanks again for taking the time to speak with us  so how many types of mushrooms do you grow here  a couple of hundred depending on the season  does that include a mushroom called the death cap  the death cap heck no man those things are poisonous  besides they only grow in the wild  well lets say we were looking for the death cap around here   where would we find it  well i know a few places in the hills  why do you ask  why do you ask why do i ask  why do you ask why do i ask why do you ask  why do you ask why do i ask   why do you ask why do  shawn  im im just curious  yeah well a guy came in here a couple of weeks ago  and he had the exact same question  do you remember this persons name  cant say that i do but i remember exactly what he looked like   can you give us a description  yeah okay man  the guy was about ninefeet tall right  he had sunshine coming out of his mouth and he had a hippotamus for a hand   i dont think i have any more questions  yep thatll do it  okay uncle burton just let me know when youre all packed up  and ill pick you up and take you to the airport all right  we spent two hours riding up to that mushroom farm  and were right back to when we started  dont be such a gloomy you gus look at the bright side   now we know the killer is a he  and that he has a hippopotamus for a hand  that helps us out a lot   dad what are you doing here  sagittarius   please return the bb gun you confiscated from your son in the second grade  ps you are a crankypants  thats an amazing coincidence  didnt you confiscate a bb gun from me in the second grade  look shawn heres your stuff  next time you want something from me be an adult and ask for it  passing yourself off as a psychic thats bad enough  but horoscopes shawn shawn  what if some idiot out there reads this crap   and decides to take it seriously  dad  it clearly states that astrological forecasts  are for entertainment purposes only  besides i only took the job for a case  were investigating the restaurant critic murder  the cops already have a suspect but were pretty sure that chef antonio   was framed  then i assume you know all about the  veggie burger incident  of course we know about the veggie burger incident dad  were professional detectives   gus  googling it  shawn you know maybe instead of wasting your time  writing this garbage for the newspaper you might try reading it once in a while  a couple of months ago vegetarian customers at antonios restaurant  started complaing about how bland the vegetarian burgers were  in my personal opinion you eat a burger without beef in it  youve lost the right to complain about flavor  ive heard that speech before just call someone a hippie and get to the point  the point is antonio decided to make the burgers tastier  by adding beef broth to the recipe  oh great all the complaints stopped till some crazed vegan lady   by the name of dwyer   found out about it  and started organizing boycotts against antonios restaurant  theyve been feuding ever since  this guy secretly fed beef to vegetarians  why are we trying to get him out of jail  because he didnt kill the critic take a look at this article shawn  she advocates any action to put chef antonio out of business  for the veggie burger incident  she calls herself the vegan vigilante  how very villainous of her  you think she couldve framed antonio for wagners death or what  only one way to find out  do you know where this dwyer lady might be  sure i saw her at the drivethru a couple of days ago  thats very helpful dad  what makes you think shell be there today  meat is murder  stop eating your fellow creatures  all animals have got the right to live  meat is murder  i hate it when my dads right  stop eating your fellow creatures  all animals have got the right to live  yo vegan vigilante lady   how long have you been out here  three days  we heard that you had a grudge with chef antonio   were you near his restaurant recently  yeah  i led a protest outside of his place on tuesday night  tuesday night  excuse us  that was the same night the critic was poisoned  dude i think we just found our killer  detective lassiter sbpd   whos in charge of this freak fest  guys we got your message  will you please tell us what this has to do with the  case   nice shirt  thanks  did you buy that today by any chance  this old rag nah  ive had this thing for just about forever  remember when i sent off those cereal box tops to get this thing  you didnt do that   sure i did  no you didnt  it was the same year you got your first cabbage patch  shut up   i remember  why do you ask jules  all right this wack job is in violation of at least six different  municipal codes and she smells like curly fries  i say we cut her loose take her down wheres the restaurant manager  hes probably inside managing the restaurant  copy that  wait for it wait for it   is there a problem  no no im just  making sure im not being followed  good cop always aware of his surroundings  i better go help him  uncle burton  burton i got here as soon as i could  who are all these strange people  its all a part of our investigation we had to come check out a lead   thanks for meeting me down here  oh no problem  that ride in the cab gave me a chance to fill out this postcard  letting everybody in the family know about our psychic detective  well i hope you saved some room on there   cause i just solved the case  yeah  a few months ago chef antonio put beef broth in his veggie burgers  at his restaurant infuriating vegetarians all over santa barbara  that woman tried to put the chef out of business  but it didnt work  so instead she poisoned the critic and framed chef antonio for it  what are you talking about i never poisoned anybody  you guys are nuts  hey watch the way you talk to my nephew cause he can see right into your soul  you were there on the night it happened  and im sure that seeing the chef behind bars must make you pretty happy  well of course it makes me happy  he didnt have respect for the rights of animals   meat is murder  but murder is also murder miss dwyer  well be right there  guys theres been a development in your case  someone died from eating death caps that were discarded downtown yesterday   yesterday  yesterday  dude it couldnt be her shes been chained to a pole for three days  plus were now here near downtown  she still couldve done it  she could have easily have slipped out of here   and done it when no one was around  actually she couldnt have  we have a rough description of the suspect that threw the mushrooms away  it was a sixfoot tall man  psychic bogus  our second victim was a homeless man  ate a bag of death caps he saw being tossed in a dumpster yesterday  then went to the health clinic today after complaing of abdominal pains  he died a few hours ago  what else do we know about the person who discarded them  not much the victim died before he was able to give us an accurate description  and chef antonio was in custody so it looks like hes innocent  not if he had an accomplice now that weve got the chef  his partners out there trying to dispose of evidence  lets go down to lockup talk to that chef  thanks  see you later   where was the dumpster located  at the corner of laguna and vista  shawn we were on the right track  laguna and vista is across the street from the newspaper  whoever threw out those mushrooms works at the paper  we have to go back over there   uncle burtons flight leaves in an hour  i dont care  do you know whats at stake here shawn my entire future with my family  yeah that two unsolved murders and an innocent man whos still in jail  but your family too  dude we still have no idea who the killer is  and its gonna take longer than an hour to figure that out  fine lets go to the stupid airport  listen burton  maybe youre not all to blame for fouling up this case  i mean i cant help but think that youd do better at this detective business  if you didnt have shawn weighing you down  i mean i dont see what hes bringing to the operation  youre psychic hes not   what do you need him around for  you know  gus your uncle has a point  what im trying to say is it was murder she wrote not murder they wrote   thats true  oh this is great  i left some of my clothes at the hotel  maybe if somebody hadnt rushed me down to the burger stand  i wouldnt have forgotten to pack my new yellow hippo shirt   you mean your hip shirts  no i mean my hippo shirt  i bought a couple of em down on state street  you know normally i dont go for modern fashion but these hippo shirts  they make my arms look so huge  theyve got a nice little hippo logo right on the sleeve see  nice  he had sunshine coming out of his mouth  he had a hippotamus for a hand  gus i just figured it out  who had the best access to the person picking the next restaurant critic  think about it  uncle burton you might be a little late for your flight  so im proud to announce that our new restaurant critic will be  my hardworking assistant nick  thank you so much sir  i am so surprised i honestly didnt expect to get this job at all  thats not exactly true is it   whoa gus  dont worry i got it  you knew that phil pritikin would give you this job  thats why you murdered vince wagner   wait  i said i got it  hang on hang on   youre saying hes the killer  yes  and im going to tell you exactly how he did it  in just a second  you never told me how he did it   why do you think im trying to stop you  what are we gonna do  my uncle thinks im the psychic the newspaper thinks youre a psychic  and the cops think im just translating your visions   give me a second to think  hurry up  okay i have a plan  blurt out something nonsensical do it now  keylaces shoeboards pineapples  oh no the visions have become too complex for one person to decipher   gus might i offer my help  yes shawn you  magic head  two heads working together as one  you  you wanted the most coveted job the paper had to offer  and you were in the good graces of the one guy that could give it to you  but there was a problem now  what was that problem  the problem was wagner was never going to retire  so what did you do  you hatched a plan to force wagner off the job  the first thing you need was a fall guy  unfortunately lee majors wasnt available  apparently he was available he lives here in town  but he was a little out of your price range  so you flipped through wagners hate mail and you discovered that  chef antonio was the perfect candidate  you knew antonios signature dish was his wild mushroom risotto  so what did you do  you tracked down some death cap mushrooms  and baked em into a risotto that resembled antonios  but you made two mistakes first  you sliced your mushrooms into cubes instead of strips and second  wagner noticed that his risotto was cold  why would risotto be served cold in a fivestar restaurant  because antonio didnt cook it you snuck it in  we just had a surprise inspection a few days ago  a simple call to the county will confirm that there were no real  health inspectors at antonios restaurant that night  you posed as one  and that gave you the cover you need to switch out the risotto  with your poisoned batch  stop  wagner died antonio was arrested  and no one suspected you were the real killer  this this is preposterous  you cant just walk in here and accuse someone of being a murderer  well
