dad im pretty sure i did finish it  it sounds to me like it was stolen  oh so somebody breaks into the school and the only thing they steal is your painting   whys that  because its the perfect crime  sit  shawn there is no such thing as a perfect crime  we leave in 45 minutes make something pretty  lassie wow is your hair starting its own cult  trying to do a performance review here mr spencer  i thank you not to bother us  that seems like a strange thing to thank me for but youre welcome of course  and now as a show of gratitude   how about a little advance on our next case  you do realize youre not an actual employee of the police department  define actual wait define police   wait  im not giving you an advance on a case  that may or may not happen in the future  perhaps i know something you dont  no well lets be honest its not like crime is going to suddenly stop is it gus   seems very unlikely  out  so thats a no on the advance  pardon me for asking the obvious question but how are you out of money  you have no possessions and no expenses   thats mostly true  thats completely true  but gus and i also have a big ski vacation planned  ski vacation  mr spencer its the middle of summer where are you going to find snow at this time of year   are we ever gonna start skiing  soon as i finish this hot chocolate   why dont you just throw it out  i would but   this hot cocoa represents the end of our vacation money  how are we out of cash weve only been here four hours  the american dollar was not as strong as i anticipated gus  which is why i had to put the whole thing on a credit card  you dont have a credit card shawn  i said a credit card not my credit card its your card  thats why im being so aggressive about getting the money to pay you back hi   hi  hello  see that man a month ago i wouldve had us styled up   with those girls tonight  what  but im spoken for now i have abigail and she has me  you have been talking about her this whole time why didnt you bring abigail on this trip  gus you are my best friend just because ive entered into some newfangled relationship  does not mean that our guy time   goes by the wayside  you know shawn  if youre gonna keep staring at girls you cant preach about how committed you are to abigail  all right first of all the person im staring at is a man hes handsome  dimples brooding eyebrows but a man nonetheless and i   know that guy  you dont know that guy  i think hes wearing 10000 skis  all you own is that hot chocolate  no ive seen this guy before i just cant place where  well i can play too  i need you to like me  he arrested ernesto ramon chavez  dude you remember when we were in lassies apartment  and we saw his wall of suspects   you mean when lassiter killed that guy  he didnt kill him we got him exonerated  i got punched and pistolwhipped remember  im still not sure he didnt kill that guy   lassiter  lassie  what does the name pierre despereaeux  mean to you   are you in my apartment  please  i havent snuck into your apartment in weeks  which reminds me were all out of peanut butter  spencer whatever youre up to   just stop all right theres no need for a psychic with an art thief   hes an art thief  no way  a dangerous art thief right never been caught  never left enough evidence to be accused  lassie just cut to the chase what kind of reward are we looking at for catching this guy  or an advance for catching him  or a finders fee because im looking right at him  no no you dont do anything all right you have no jurisdiction up there  you have no jurisdiction anywhere especially in canada  youre not thinking this thing through  youre right youre right with the exchange rates we wont get the check right away gus   ask about taxes  spencer you listen to me  despereaux is mine i absolutely forbid you to do anything  sorry lassie too late its time for us to catch a thief  so what do we do now do we call the authorities  we make sure its despereaux and i have an ingenious plan to smoke him out   sounds good  pierre   that was your plan  lets go  turn turn turn  i think we shouldve taken that second ski lesson  were doing great remember what the instructor said  pizza slices to slow down  french fries to speed up  we got him theres only one move we cant follow  whats that   he just made it  the slow gentle turn  that was it  pizza pizza  you know what this means gus   that we suck at skiing  no it means that this hot chocolate  just became a writeoff    psych s04e01   extradition british columbia    vo by merana    thx for timecodes   so

want to do this shawn  have a little faith gus ive done it once i can do it again   we are in a foreign land  not really   we went through immigration  why you gotta question everything  heres the thing robert the thing is this  i am a psychic  we work for the santa barbara police department weve solved over 47 cases  im also a pharmaceutical rep if that means anything to you   youve seen the mentalist right  yes   its like that  except that guys a fake  right if i was a fake psychic it would be eerily similar   exactly the same  a virtual carbon copy  okay well now mr spencer you seem like a nice enough guy but  you should know that there are many here at the rcmp that would be a little  more skeptical of these alternative methods than  youre probably used to in the states   whats he doing  hes having a psychic episode   its a bit offputting  you get used to it  hey biking to work i like it its great for the environment  i live a kilometer away but uh yeah actually its cleaner  hey you hows the little guy is he walking yet  um barely he just turned one do i know you  hello  robert give me your mitts  im sensing that you have a lot of really good ideas  but that nobody around here seems to want to listen stay the course buddy  youll have your day  im getting ed  i am getting ed  you gotta be more careful shawn  this big boss comes out its make or break no more wild guesses  you seem like a  get your socks ready gus cause im about to knock them off  what you got   i got nothing what have you got  nothing   i got it  no you dont shawn its obvious   yes i do shh shh  dont

amazing  my birthdas today howd you know that  its all right here   lassiter  hello there constable  this is deputy commissioner ed dykstra with the vancouver rcmp office  and im here with a couple of fellas you work for and they have some  psychic information about a  uh pierre despereaux   you familiar with him  familiar  ive been tracking that man for six years  im the closest anyones ever gotten to catching him  hey thats terrific  if you could just send up those files detective spencer and i would be much obliged  detective are you kidding me  despereaux is not to be messed with okay  check with interpol hes cunning and extremely  dangerous and if he is up there you will need  my expertise on this i know all his patterns i want to be made a full partner on this  well i think thats something you better run by your superior here   no noi dont want  hey there buddy  spencer you listen to me  and you listen good you do not touch despereaux  you will wait for me i will be on the next flight up there  well i sure would love to see you too man but dont you think you should probably focus  on your case load  i dont think the chiefs going to approve this  i have 325 days of unused vacation time i will see you in five hours  chief  little favor to ask  i mean do you believe that a highranking member of the us law enforcement  not being allowed to carry his weapon on him  did you really think it wouldnt set off the metal detector  ive got to get my hands on a gun ohara i have enemies everywhere   maybe i can pick one up at the hotel  oh absolutely  right downstairs in the gift shop  they have kleenex mixed nuts and 9millimeter lugers  thanks for letting me use your miles  thanks for bringing me along  if i didnt bring you along you wouldnt let me use your miles  still it was really sweet  hi shawn  what  sea taxi to false creek  no no tell him were not here on a sightseeing mission tell him we are here on official business  okay okay got you  it is business looks like despereaux already made his first strike  its a crime scene  uh can i help you  listen dudley im detective lassiter and this is my partner juliet ohara  were from the santa barbara police department  oh you work for mr shawn spencer  eh sorry so sorry  ive been instructed not to let anyone in without checking with head detective spencer first  this is a joke right  brace yourself guys  he never steals a single item its always always multiples  thats directly from my report spencer  shh dont interrupt the head detective when hes working  the ions are specifically concentrated here  and here  crime ions  write that down   this is mr lassiter  detective  okay and his partner juliet ohara  they are from santa barbara  welcome aboard glad you made it okay  hi jules you look  normal and stuff i got nothing  uh this is mr stockwell owner of the necklace in question  well mr stockwell may i call you gibby   my first name is randolph  ive heard it both ways  hows he doing   hes been better  let me start by saying  let us not cry over spilled syrup if im being honest  its a little silly for a man of your stature to wear a necklace like this dont you think   what the hell are you talking about  the necklace  is an authentic edwardian baroque calibercut piece  it has never touched human skin it is worth 35 million  what are we talking canadian dollars  he stole something else too he stole a painting   ed hes better than i thought im afraid  i sold that painting two weeks ago  if i may id like to determine whether this was actually the work of despereaux now  i assume you found no alarms tripped no prints  no none but we did find a  burning cigarette in the ashtray over there and mr stockwell is not a smoker  a merchanteuse blonde  blonde wheres the blonde ill need to read her immediately  its a blonde filtered cigarette merchanteuse its french  despereaux always leaves one burning as his signature  despereaux always comes in and out of town undetected  with an army of aliases usually of an artist  pardon me if everyone would like to adjourn to the roof  the psychic criminalcatching portion of the day is about to begin  everyone just please stay where you are he does this all the time  mildly impressive that you found me here  you two are making a marked improvement from your  harlequinade antics on the slopes   in my defense i have two left knees  you know whats more impressive  in about 15 seconds youre gonna see  a fierce albeit gunless american detective  his striking snow bunny partner which  i mean nothing salacious by and half the rcmp  are gonna storm this roof and take you down  wait for it  id love to but i really have to go  where do you think youre going  to my room  now its your turn  to wait for it  okay clearly that was more impressive  i am telling you he was here   he was right here  and he jumped off   from a handstand  it it   wasnt from a handstand he just he jumped off normal style   he jumped off a 26story building  sir somebody was just spotted   coming out of the service elevator  we didnt have a man down there  because you asked everyone to come up here   you know because of shawn  it doesnt matter its not him  we just saw despereaux leap from this building   he was wearing a flying suit  he wawewe dont know that  guys  ed  look i just want you to know that i believe you  completely except for the jumping off the building part  mackintosh   we looked like idiots  gus we have to regroup  and we need to eat   shawn this place seems a little  exclusive  dark cozy  romantic a little sexy  first of all you say those words like theyre bad things  secondly do you know how hard it is to get a reservation at this place   you have to call like a month in advance  you invited me on this trip on friday   when did you call  its irrelevant  what matters  dude dude  there he is hes sitting right there what do we do do we call the cops   what if he sees us  he sees us   how do you know  hes waving us over   oh my gosh he is  we shouldnt go over there   right  right  we found you so looks like we win  i am neither known nor wanted in this country  at best im a person of interest in the places i do my work  such is the curse of my talent  so since i have taken the time to find you please  dont spoil it with rudeness have a seat  thank you  you know ive uh ive enjoyed our sparring so far  the look on your faces when i jumped from that building was uh  amusing but   id be remiss if i didnt inform you that youre  that youre way out of your league the simple fact is  youll never catch me its impossible  which makes what should be an exciting life  somewhat pedestrian  ill tell you what  to make this more interesting for me  im going to write down everything that im going to do  sometime tomorrowim going to steal a manet  and then im going to make you look foolish again  and then the next day im going to treat myself like a king  okay  heres what im going to do first  im going to get some of that maple candy that everybody seems to be raving about  then im going to purchase myself a walking stick  preferably something with a rams head carved into the handle  and finally were going to catch ourselves an international art thief  im not saying for sure its going to be you but uh  right now youre at the top of the list  are you writing on our cloth napkins  look its not my fault okay you guys should have some sort of notepad system  like next to pay phones they have a little a little pad that you  i just dont understand why anyone would want to do that  unless youre animals of course   animals whoa  what is that  oh you know what that is  where did he go he disappeared again  i believe so unless hes hiding under the table  in which case this conversation would be embarrassing  no im afraid we fell for the flaming baked alaska diversion trick again  so what are we supposed to do  you gonna pretend like you got the information about the manet psychically  please gus thats cheap and easy give me some credit  we dont know why he just handed this information over to us   well do what any reasonable detective would do  whats that  i see a man  net yes  i see the painter john manet  edouard  where in town might one find an   edouard manet  what he said  because i believe that despereaux is going to try and steal one tonight  how clear are you on this  its as if he wrote it on a piece of paper and put it in my hand  you sure this is the only manet  yes theres not a single one at a gallery in town  i took the initiative of making a book of all the things of value  that despereaux might hit i even used my binditall not a manet on the list  but then your girl detective there she did a little more digging and found this   this is william charles pulvers boat  yacht   yacht hes a billionaire  millionaire  okay former billionaire now millionaire living off of his yacht  has an extensive art collection he sailed into town yesterday  he has a lateperiod manet hanging over the piano in his state room  what exactly are you wearing   what oh i  you look like julie christie in doctor zhivago  i get cold okay i grew up in a subtropical climate  no ii didnt mean it i think its you know i mean i think it looks nice  shawn what is the matter with you   we can still talk as friends  ii know that  all right i cant do this spencer youve got to find me a weapon of some sort  i dont care if its a cane with a blow dart in it if this thing goes down and it gets ugly  were waiting for a single man to enter an empty boat  which may require deadly force   shawn i gotta pee  i told you to go back at the hotel  i couldnt i got freaked out there were rose petals everywhere  all over the toilet why would they do that its weird  its not weird its wonderful   did you see that  what   i saw something its a shadow  no its not a shadow its a person   what is he doing out here  hes definitely packing heat   that makes one of you  shut up guster  well lets all just think this through  there is a man and a shadow on the dock   repeat a man and a shadow down on the dock  tell them not to approach  well dont dont approach   dont approach the man or the shadow  theyre approaching  false alarm it is a false alarm this is not our perp   everybody back to  its too late  he took it already  thats definitely not a manet  so he pretty much told us exactly what he was going to steal  where he was gonna iteal st from and when he was gonna be there and we still couldnt catch him   i mean how good is this guy gus  shawn  why are we on this carriage ride you dont find it oddly romantic  what  no not at all  what better way for a couple best buddies to  take in the stars some cool crisp canadian air  maybe solve an art theft  so just let me know when you want me to head to the kissing bridge   wait a minute  what  wait a  now it all makes sense this whole thing  the rose petals on the bed the reservation at the bistro now this carriage ride  this whole trip it was all planned as a romantic week for you and abigail  i  okay all right okay i admit it  the dates for her teachers conference changed quite unexpectedly  thats why you asked me at the last minute i was an afterthought  gus dont get caught up in the minutiae of trip planning  thats it you deceived me shawn im done with this im finished  we need to figure out what despereauxs next move is  besides you do not want to get out of this carriage  its freezing its dark out here  and there are most likely raccoons everywhere  uh im staying here you are getting out  my credit card paid for this ride and im taking it just not with you   but good luck figuring out this case  no gus please stop it  wha at least leave me the blanket  hello raccoons i know youre watching me  i dont blame you id be doing the same thing if i was you i mean who am i  some mysterious biped infiltrating your natural habitat  i know you dont mean to scare me with your beady little yellow eyes that glow like the devil  lets do a list well do a list of famous raccoons  meeko from pocahontas check  rocky raccoon  judges good reading on rocky ra  where do you think youre going  to my room  okay  okay you little  masked night bandits  i gotta go  i think i know where despereaux is  but youbut youre probably not interested  well its  maybe a couple of you are more so than  more so than the others  hello bertrand   yes sir how may i help you  i seem to have misplaced my card key  oh well id be happy to replace your key i just need your name  pierre despereaux  im sorry uh theres no one by that name registered here  despereaux always comes in and out of town undetected with an army of aliases  usually of an artist  uh heres the thing  i register under a lot of different names in order to protect my privacy  so why dont we try john van gogh  nothing  jacques hockneystein  stine  okay uh sir  um im not sure what shenanigans youre up to but i dont like it   and i dont appreciate it  it mightve been edgar degas   well yes yes that name is here   um do you think i could get a  im so sorry about this  its my assistant that makes all the reservations shes been under heavy medication  she was recently diagnosed with parvo  well isnt that a dogs disease  yes yes it is my assistant is a golden retriever  adorable but dim  her whole keyboard is just three big buttons she has very large paws ah  shouldve fired her years ago but shes a rescue and i just didnt have the heart  gus guess where i am right now  im in despereauxs room right now  yeah im gonna im gonna rifle through all of this stuff  and then im totally gonna pull a john turturro from millers crossing on him  and then well get some sundaes im just gonna sit here quietly  wait for him to get back and then im gonna click on the lamp  scare the gingersnaps out of him what  no i dont remember how that movie ends why  thats a  negativo on the sundaes buddy i repeat negative on the sundaes  so so  this is your room  this is embarrassing isnt it i mean uh  its a real rattlesnake of a misunderstanding its its amazing how much this place looks  just like the room that gus and i have over at the   captain vancouver doright inn  sit  you know  i never was a fan of millers crossing  too much gore and violence i mean dont get me wrong  i appreciate a good murder  but why does it have to be so messy  wheres the elegance the grace  people dont kill people with panache anymore  i wish i could stay and chat with you but im actually getting ready to press on  there there wouldnt happen to be a manet in that suitcase by any chance would there  you know you should keep at this detective business mr spencer  you have the hair for it and laundry delivery day tuesday  thats half the battle  what  oh you thought my marco ciccone loafers were a gun   maybe  no no no no mr spencer  this is my gun you see  a gentleman of leisure never packs his weapon next to his socks  its uncouth  what you think im going to kill you   no  youre right  not yet anyway  i have to be pushed very hard to get into that kind of business  number one its messy and i have to spend one more night here  number two you have nothing on me but your word  your very shaky very suspect word  therefore you pose absolutely no threat to me whatsoever  i do have to thank you though  you have been very useful for me   my pleasure  and now if you dont mind  oh uh i dont even know how to respond im both relieved  and offended at the same time but  i know when im beat  one more thing  what day is today  sunday  yeah thats what i thought  spencer i dont want to hear it anymore i am telling you he is done  he is heading for the border  lassie listen its not molson time just yet   i know hes going to steal one more thing  so whats he going to steal   i dont know  where is it then  i dont have a completely clear picture on that but i am honing i am a honer  there is a small jet  waiting at a private airfield just over the border in blaine washington   registered to one of his aliases   barry picasso  no  its scheduled to take off in four hours we plan on being there  okay look guys heres the thing i actually spoke with him last night  what do you mean you spoke with him  i mean i had a a vision wherein we we spoke  see he he had a vision what exactly was he doing in this vision  packing  of course he was packing because hes leaving town  wrong because he wanted me to to think he was leaving town  it was all a show for my benefit  there is no way this guy would leave town with out his dry cleaning  and that does not get delivered until tuesday  trust me he cares just as much about his pants as he does about thievery  so let me get this straight despereaux comes to you in a vision  to fake doing something  i do have to thank you though you have been very useful for me  i was a smokescreen  he used me as a smokescreen  im sorry shawn but this is a really good lead  wait wait wait guys dont you at least want to hear my plan  it could be good you dont know  what   i want to see your book  my book  yeah the one with things that despereaux might steal   nobody ever wants to see my book  i do i want to see the book  im also going to eat these waffles  i gotta hand it to you mackintosh the binding on this thing is impressive  the presentation i mean just outstanding  and then the next day im going to treat myself like a king  he told me everything  that clever bastard  who  what can you tell me about the buschlen mowatt gallery in yaletown  well i know quite a bit actually what in particular  in particular uh the security system  government issue actually i was on the team that installed it and set it up  thats fortuitous can it be set down  i have a shot at redemption for you for recognition  but its going to be dangerous and were gonna need gus are you in  wait before you answer that are you a fan of solving crimes   yes  thats my man   thats him  thats who  thats the gallery owner hes the last one out  that means its closed we can go inside thats where the crown is  that was your plan shawn to steal the crown  no absolutely not dont be ridiculous  possibly move the crown at best but the point is to get to it first before despereaux  not only is this a felony of international proportions shawn  but also we are not art thieves  what do you think this is for  big apple come in are we good to go  uh just about shawn  uh over  see gus  its not really breaking in if the actual cops help you break in am i right  do i need to explain the law to you shawn  you can try but its probably not going to make much of a difference  so how do you plan on getting through this obstacle  dude i know youve seen entrapment at least 26 times  you have to do this youre twice as limber as c zetajones  uhuh shawn not happening  gus we dont have a lot of options here its not like we can turn back  look its three lasers plus theyre canadian lasers  im gonna guide you through this  usain bolt   gus to the world  thats what im talkin about  you got this  thats it buddy  now now lower your right shoulder just a little bit like two inches  yeah there you go  thats your way in thats your way in thats your gateway  arch your back  clear  watch your feet watch your feet okay youre good  okay all right this ones a little trickier  knee to chest knee to chest  now pivot about 30 degrees  to your left safe  dude thats your safe haven thats your safe haven  right hand green right hand green   thats twister shawn oh yeah  how come we dont play that anymore  get your butt higher arch your back spread your cheeks if you can  scratch that abort cheek spreading pivot  pivot your body about 30 degrees left to the left  boom but what  what are you doing  oh buddy i had mackintosh disarm the lasers too  but i wanted to see how you would do it  now we know for the future that if we ever encounter this exact scenario  oh you are the man for the job what  there it is  wheres the crown its in that metal box  it closes when the gallery does dont worry mackintosh disarmed this too  this my friend is the easy part   i thought you said this was the easy part  its supposed to be the easy part  dont i get any credit for planning this whole thing in like less than two hours  no you dont get any credit the cops are gonna be here any second now  they will not  man stop playing theres nobody behind me   shut up shawn  im not turning around  freeze  dad   they arrested you too  i posted your bail shawn  it was more than i expected you owe me the difference plus the exchange rate  do you realize they charged me nine bucks for an us magazine   what about me  dad you didnt bail out gus  now i gotta bail both of you out wheres your dad  shawn used my one call to vote for american idol  shawn you didnt say anything about  gus i thought he had his own cash dont you have a credit card  my credit card is maxed out  dad believe me ive spoken to him about not overextending himself   shawn do you really think this is fun  well stanley park was nice  you do realize you cant leave this country  dad do you understand we had him   but  but what shawn   he was too good  too good   whatd i raise you to do  it was literally the perfect crime  the perfect crime there is no such thing as a perfect crime shawn  all right well fine well then it was as close as you can possibly get   it was this close  the only way its close  is if you make it look like the perfect crime  now im gonna see if i can put gus on my credit card  in the meantime i got a 400 salmon boat and if i miss that this trip  is a complete waste  big apple what is this what happened   fired  why  really  because of what happened down at the museum  aw man im so sorry  i feel like this is partially my fault  partially it was your idea  well it probably wouldve just been a suspension  but then the crown ended up going missing so  say what  you know  it was gone   when they opened the case  thats impossible  no  when they opened the metal display case the crown was missing  wheres the crown  its in that metal box it closes when the gallery does  dude we watched the museum close  we we watched the thing close we never left the building  the only way he couldve taken it is if  how  is if he had had it all along  i sold that painting two weeks ago   hes a billionaire  millionaire  okay former billionaire now millionaire living off his yacht  oh i know why despereaux never gets caught  because he doesnt steal anything   we gotta hurry  thats my helmet  iohguys  mr spencer  you have an impressive learning curve  thank you  i also play the mandocello  not well  but who else do you know who plays the mandocello  im no longer amused  you almost had me  i mean the yacht and the high rise were just flawless  but you left me too much time when you stole the crown  and i covered all my bases  which means you didnt have time to steal the crown  but then  you didnt have to because the owner just  handed it to you  i knew you were worthy  worthy and very disappointed  really shawn  ive been hiding back here for ten minutes  i thought you were gonna give your speech from inside the plane   gus  what im seriously cramped back here  im about to drop the hammer on this guy just flag down the stewardess order a mojito  just call me when youre done  man i thought you were so cool  but youre just here to look the part  this whole time im thinking  this guy is thomas crown  youre barely remington steele  which makes me what laura holt  you think a guy like me wants to be stephanie zimbalist  maybe  the items were handed to you one by one   thats him  thats who  thats the gallery owner hes the last one out  the gallery owner had the crown when he left the gallery  he was having money troubles  as did the rest of your victims  and you  youre just the middleman  you made it look like the items were being stolen  hence your  calling card  and always in a series right  so it wouldnt call suspicion to an owner in financial peril  who suddenly gets his manet stolen  insurance fraud  really that is so lame  i mean do you even have a pilots license  i do  but now i feel as though i have to hurt you   which saddens me  i thought you were a master criminal  the genius of my plan is in its simplicity  perhaps its not as sexy as you believed  but dont forget  i got away with it  no you didnt  hello despereaux  bet youre not too happy to see me right about now are you  i have absolutely no idea  who you are  detective  thank you  your boss is really good  we do not work for him  it just seems that way sometimes  mr spencer  ive often fantasized about escaping from prison you know   shawn  yes  dont you think its odd that  youre  in a relationship now  yet you invite me to maybe the most romantic place on earth  okay look jules listen i  i made these plans weeks ago  and gus refused to come on account hes a man  and im a man  or some nonsense like that  look i have a point its this  i refuse to feel uncomfortable around you  its silly you mean too much to me and  and i am perfectly capable of keeping this  platonic as long as you are   oh please i can  well i can too  great  but how  so at least show me what you had planned for this perfect date  okay but promise not to laugh  you hired this guy  technically gus did  wouldve lost our deposit  i dont he was supposed to be more discreet   this is overkill huh  no no not if youre six  a mime though really shawn i dont know you dont really strike me as a mime guy  oh no no nothe mime had nothing to do with me this mime is  clearly working on his own  you seen enough more than   so abigails into opera huh  no not really  just robust italian men  i didnt even know he sang actually   look at that bridge  yeah its beautiful  littleknown fact   that bridge was built by wolves  really
