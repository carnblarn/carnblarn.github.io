                please dont touch it  excuse me  gus gus gus  wheres your project shawn   did you even do it  my project  of course i did it  when  when  last night  its right here  this head is to exact scale  it took me three months to make it  yours took five minutes  no gus youre totally wrong  it took me a whole hour  check this out  i hate you shawn  lompoc  okay i did it  thats seven in row  eight the gas station guy confessed last week  oh i wouldnt call myself a hero  im just doing my job just like all of you  hey thats enough goofing off  lets get back to work huh  you too  ladies and gentlemen  detective lassiter  oh stop it   jules  shawn   is there a problem  with what  with you with me with the chief  she hasnt called in a month  is she still mad about me requisitioning the segway  you did that  no  well i dont really  have time right now but the short answer is  we just havent really needed any outside help  well whats the long answer  i mean throw a but in there  and add something about a dream  where you and i got thrown out of a mattress showroom  detective lassiter is literally on fire  what kind of fire are we talking about  michael jackson in the pepsi commercial fire  or misusing the word literally fire  hes solved eight cases in a row fire  nine i just rembered the deshano case  hey shawn whats new  you still doing the psychic thing  is this some sort of weird dream  on the last two cases the first suspect  lassiter questioned confessed  its really magnificent  we are talking about carlton lassiter right  yea high  bats ninth for the department softball team  tenth we play with a rover  spencer long time no see  or is that no need  i cant believe this  oh believe it its real  theyve done a preliminary on the body down  at the marina detective  theyre ready for you at the scene  well i would love to stay and chat  but duty does call  oh spencer you look so sad  come on well show you how real cops do it  no comeback  shawn thats slightly embarrassing  whered you get that suit the toilet store  good luck with this one detective  theres no identification  nobodys been reported missing fitting this description  oh mr spencer  im surprised you didnt take the segway  she did know about that  ohara just told me  traitor  ill deal with you later  so whats the new case weve got  a slight error in grammar there buddy  which part got   i came all the way down from the office shawn  gus dont be a giant snapping turtle  well have a case in five minutes  nobody can explain these puncture wounds  we cant rule out an animal attack  no no theres nothing in these waters  with a bite radius that large  no this is maybe a boating accident  the wounds caused by some machinery  i cant really be sure at this juncture  completely stumped  you getting something  mr spencer  yes  yes i am  no no no no hold on okay ive got it  the wound on the head  was caused by the edge of a boat  when he fell in the water unconscious  and the wounds on the back  they were caused by a large industrial crab trap  or a whale  it definitely couldve been a whale  lost from his pod  separated migrating north or south  and sees our man dead already floating up  above the surface  thinks its a seal and then whale  a whale  whats your guy got  watch and learn jules  watch and learn  or detective  if you dont mind  id like to see what mr spencer has to offer  all right look  this is gonna be a little rough okay  i didnt have time for shading  theres no forced perspective  if i had really had my druthers  i wouldve done it in charcoal  you know what im talking about  look what im trying to say is  im not the artist id like to be  okay mr spencer enough  can you or can you not tell us whos responsible  for this mans death  if i can present you with a semiaccurate sketch  of the culprit is that enough to get us on this case  yes  all right  the puncture wounds  theyre the key  giving me the impression that this crime could only  have been committed by this guy  this guy here  excuse me  what  chief  where are you off to  so what thats a no  gus  this is not a boating accident  psych 202  65 million years off  o i know you know o  o that im not telling the truth o  o i know you know o  o they just dont have any proof o  o wheres the deception o  o learn how to bend o  o your worst inhibitions o  o tend to psych you out in the end o   youre mad  no im not mad im happy  im thrilled i love looking like an idiot  well that explains your shoes  you almost closed down our agency  with that little act of yours shawn  me  youre the one spending all your extra time  at your little side project   you mean my real job  soon to be my only job  gus youre panicking dont panic  those bite marks are consistent with a tyrannosaurus bite  you know that yes i know that  the hard way  i was canned from the wyoming natural history museum  for that little shot  the bruises from the teeth didnt go away for a year  but totally worth it  it was my best screensaver ever  gus please connecting a dinosaur to this case  is the least of our worries  look i can i stash a toy dinosaur  in the window of the killer  i can link him to a box of dino bites or fruity pebbles  i can play six degrees of dinosaur with you right now  youve never been in a movie with kevin bacon  or a dilaposaurus have you  how about you play six degrees of kiss my ass  first of all that sounds like a totally disturbing game  whats weird is that my guess on the jaw radius  was actually spot on  it almost seems to make sense  so now youre getting on board with your own joke theory  how are you gonna match your bite radius  to the victim shawn  drag the body to the wyoming museum  i can do you one better  what  i need to borrow my dads truck  you coming or what  thats clearly a no  the one thing we can be sure of is  the cause of death was not drowning  blunt force trauma to the head was severe enough  to knock him unconscious  more than likely he fell from some sort of  a platform after knocking himself on the head  and this is how he ended up in the water  no he landed on something hard  dislocated a rib  he has bruises consistent with a six seven  or eightfoot fall  my guess is that he landed on something else  and ultimately expired before tumbling into the water  you know this might be a leap  but i would check the offshore oil rigs  see if any of them are missing workers  ill make some calls  interesting detective  thanks chief  this theory feels good just makes sense  the work boots the odd configuration of the wounds  you know us ted its worth a shot right   we dont go out on limbs too often  thanks guys  i just need to measure something  oh good  youre all here get ready to be shocked  can we get the sheet off the dead guy please  confirming the bite radius  no mr spencer  whoa hey hey be careful this isnt mine  mr spencer your antics have always been a little  lets say unorthodox  but let me be as frank as i can be  with my assessment of your most recent behavior  seek help  chief sometimes you have to jump off a cliff  you have to close your eyes  you have to unhook your clip chasses  chassis  climbing thing  and you have to leap  now i ask you chief  will you leap with me  are you thinking about jumping off a cliff  maybe  dad  ive brought the keys back hello  okay this is creepy why is gus here  why do you think shawn  hes a hostage  perhaps i can shed some light on that  two hostages  doug devette is an old colleague of mine from the force  the chief asked me to have him drop by  why  doug is the department psychologist shawn  what is this some sort of intervention  yeah sort of  we dont like to use the term intervention shawn  gus  dont look at me  im here for the cupcakes  dad i am not on drugs  oh nobody thinks that shawn  well im not completely sure about that doug  were all just a little concerned  that you might be stretching yourself  a bit too thin  it wasnt my idea but hes right shawn  youre acting like a nut job  just because i take gus giant dinosaur  head down to a dead body does not make me a nut job  what  you took my trex  my mom gave it to you  gladly  she also gave me some pictures you can pay me to not show  your next girlfriend  what pictures  the ones that document your terence trent  darby phase  whatever shawn  you took danny dino to the police station  no gus give me some credit  i took him to the morgue  good news  your specifications were spot on  your father tells me you have delusions of magical powers  delusions really  doug im employed as a psychic  ive solved 18 cases this year  i have business cards and a personalized coffee mug  that backs up the whole thing  i feel things about people  you for instance are color blind  thats nothing to be ashamed off  youre also really stressed about something  college  it can be very expensive doug  oh that was good henry  doug do not be a stooge  not a stooge but in this one case he was right  knock at door  karen do you mind  were in the middle of an intervention here  we dont have time for that  but youre the one who asked for this  and i thank you henry  but im afraid that this cant wait  we just got a break in the case  we just found out the name of the dead man  you want to tell him who he is detective  no  his name was christopher franzen  he is a paleontologist  a dinosaur hunter  as expected  doug  pleasure was all mine  oh no shawn mine  we should get together  all right heres what we know so far  a man a paleontology professor washes ashore with wounds  specific to a dinosaur  i dont think we can rule out the possibility of island  somewhere in the pacific where dinosaurs do exist  and have an appetite for jeff goldblum  im being serious shawn  well look whos mr onboard and sounding like  a whacked wombat  then what is it  i dont know  it actually scares me that my wild dinosaur reach  landed so close to the bullseye  this guy was possibly killed by something dinosaurrelated  but it was probably a model or something from  the archaeology department  well have to spend the better part  of the next 24 hours sifting through  their entire collection of artifacts  and by we i mean mostly you  this is all there is  no no no no  this is just the big stuff  we got the trilobites in a shoebox  but the shelf is kind of high  youve got pinhead chatterbox surgeon and stitch  up there on a shelf  shawn those are cenobites  well what are trilobites  fish fossils  oh gus for my sake at least pretend like  you dont know this stuff off the top of your head  do this move  trilo trilobite  what itll help you  im serious  look ethan i can honestly say  there were more historically significant items  in the lost and found at the taco johns in porterville  yeah  yeah its a little sad  word is the whole program is going under  you sure about that  look professor franzen would never really give us  a straight answer  in fact most nights he wasnt around to give us any answers  he was a pretty crappy advisor  and when he did show up he was late tired  completely disheveled  nobody really trusted the guy  look do not ever take a class from him  hes dead  oh yeah  then totally  well this sure was a dead end  yep but at least we were the first ones  to find the dead end  oh come on  he really is on fire  literally  i dont get this  the cops beat us to the dead guys house  i dont know how i feel about the police department  being so proactive  feeling the heat  what do you think im afraid of a little competition  i know youre afraid of competion  why else would you have purposefully broken  the battlezone at pizza royale  dude you beat me once  and only because you first  used the eye piece and then revealed you had pinkeye  lets venture off the beaten path  whats wrong  im just trying to figure out what to do here  since as a rule we dont break and enter  what do you mean we dont break and enter  the 2400 motel  the hotel de la cruz  the spellmasters box  yeah but we really shouldnt pick this lock  you know i want to pick that lock  yes i do  watch out  what are you the lock whisper  are you channeling michael jackson  who heard the second click  i heard the second click  really  come on  i cant see anything  oh i got it i got it  gus that thing is brighter than the sun  think you just gave me glaucoma  you cant give someone glaucoma  thank you  this is better than the entire university department  it sure is  and his digging equipment is some heavy duty stuff  looks like some shovels are missing  part of a portable light kit  a lot of brushes  and fine finishing equipment which i would assume  he was only using in the lab  dude i got something what  he was the worst tictactoe player  in the history of the world  im investigating and youre analyzing his doodles  doodles are the window to the soul gus  or maybe thats the epiglottis  wheres the uvula  lassiters here  that guys like five minutes behind us everywhere we go  dont sleep in the nude tonight  spencer  enjoying your time riding my behind  definitely not in the nude  this lock looks too high tech for a backyard shed  we gotta find somebody who can crack the code  theres already someone here who can do that  that person is me  well make yourself useful  ill need you to step back please  give me some room to operate  further please  further  jules could you help me out here  just get him back onto the cobblestone  thats good thats good  thank you  i am sensing the first two digits  what is it 31  gus help me out here  come on buddy  you can have my tony gwynn rookie 25   eight  three  three  four  two  and two  theres one more  wait  theres one more  nine  that was amazing  ill give you that one  cant see a thing in here  oh ive got it  wait im sensing a light switch  tools are missing  good work detective  he had a blunt force trauma  that could be supplied by one of these missing items  maybe this rock hammer or this medium shovel  but where would they be  the bed of his pickup  it wasnt parked out front or at the university  we find that truck we find the murder weapon  lets go ohara  burning daylight  excuse us  man you missed the truck  im not the psychic  what  why would someone frequent a fruit stand  thats over 50 miles away  they like pomegranate  yeah i know him  he was my best customer  dont know his name  but he comes by every night before closing  did you ever see which way he went  yeah  always up the hill  thats all i see  although every once in a while  i see him come back down the hill early in the morning  well thank you very much  gus you got anything else  yes is that peach pie in the back  yeah  another dead end  lets turn around  hold on a second  this looks like a place someones been sneaking into  what is this  looks like some kind of farmland  or grazing plain  oh look at that  its like that movie the one with sigourney weaver   aliens  no   alien  no  alien resurrection  gus the one with the holes and shia labeouf  they had holes in shia labeouf  the holes are in the ground dude like that  and jon voight was walking around all crazy  ohanaconda  yeah never mind  gorillas in the mist   death and the maiden  no  half moon street  just let it go  ill be damned  what  somebodys shooting at us  oh god theyre shooting  were gonna die  run gus  gus run like the wind  no get get up  come on get in the car  hurry up shawn  start it start it  go go go  dude look at the road while youre driving   im staying down for safety  he was shooting  directly into the air gus  bullets go up they have to come down  do you know what the trajectory would have to be for that to happen  dont you dare argue physics with me  not while were in the process of almost being killed  didnt you see the trespassers will be shot sign  oh yeah  it totally said that  my bad  mr spencer if you have any substantial information concerning  the christopher franzen case please get on with it  ive got something  its a cluck  a cluck  actually theres two  two clucks  a cluckcluck here  a bawkbawk there  here a bawk there a  cluck  everywhere a bawkbaaawk  let me guess you have a name  macdonald perhaps  no no its a farm  with a farmer an old farmer  farmer shooty pants  thats a nickname   i dont think thats his actual handle  ive got it  lassiter found the paleontologists truck   you helped  i did help  it was his hunch  it was down at the old marina i just had a feeling  i also found the prints of a certain grad student named ethan robinson  along with a stack of letters from said grad students demanding the professor  stop ruining his life  were sending a car over to pick him up  oh im sorry am i interrupting your trance  i dont buy it  which part  the damning evidence or the murder weapon  theres more going on in this guys life chief im sensing  digging  yeah the archaeology department was going under  he was trying to make a big discovery  put him on the map get more funding  the farm  i can see the name of the farm  its wallll  wall  walker farms yeah we got that lead off the phone records yesterday  apparently our victim made a series of phone calls  to the farmer trying to buy some of his land but it wasnt for sale  farmer was forthcoming cooperative  definitely not a suspect  anything else  i have to say you have been very through  were just doing what any good cops would do   shawn what are you doing  yeah what are we doing shawn   i need to borrow some tools  what kind of tools  digging tools a little excavation project we got going on   are you still on that dinosaur thing  were still on that dinosaur thing  what is there an echo in here yes were still on the dinosaur thing  we step foot on the far end of this guy walkers farm in ojai  and he starts blasting us with buckshot  we know our dead guy was there every night leading up to his death  digging around the periphery of this property  no shawn wait  i dont want you borrowing my tools  oh gus will leave his class ring as collateral   no i wont  yes you will   no i wont  sure you will  no i wont  i cant support this  well theres a shocker  you not being supportive  would you shut up and listen  im saying i cant support you going somewhere where you could get shot  what are you are you worried about me  shawn ive been worried about you since you were three years old  and started eating your own toenails  well  dad ill be fine okay  were not gonna go anywhere near the house  and if itll make you feel any better i will stand behind gus the entire time   no you wont  yes i will   no you wont  oh yes i will  you want to bet  i dont like it  it doesnt feel right  i know feelings  pardon me did  did you just say i know feelings  perfect  this will be easy  oh theres a pattern here  those guys dig with a reason  how do you know that  gus i worked at the museum for almost an entire weekend before i got canned  he was the worst tictactoe player in the history of the world  wait a second  those werent tictactoe boards  those were all the places hed dug  there were like 25 xs  no way he scored that often  the xs were misses  in this case o marks the spot  and thats the o  this is the only hole filled by a bulldozer  no selfrespecting paleontologist would use a bulldozer  why do you know that  because shawn if you use a bull   gus i dont actually want to know  then dont ask  this shouldnt take long grab a shovel  and keep an eye out for that farmer   how you doing on your side  good solid  im holding up   shawn  what  im keeping watch thats how the other guy died  what youre not concerned  all right i get it  its my turn  this is the end of the loose dirt be careful  this is weird  what that theres rocks in the ground  these arent rocks  these are fossils  but theyve been processed finished off residue  rocks chipped away  stuff you would normally do in a lab  franzen found something  why wouldnt he just take it out  and do the work in the lab where it should be done  unless  unless it was too big to move  oh dude im gonna get the leaf blower  you brought a leaf blower  you gotta be kidding me  i just discovered a dinosaur  filling that hole was the worst idea ever  it had to be done gus  we have to save it for when we unmask franzens killer  i still dont get it  he was on the trail of a fossil graveyard  it lead him right to deacon farms  farmer wouldnt let him dig on the land so  he takes matters into his own hands after hours  but why wouldnt the farmer let him dig  maybe he didnt want his farm disturbed  a dig like that is worth millions to a land owner  and the fossils i discovered werent even on crop land  you discovered  dont try to take away my dinosaur discovery shawn  i wouldnt dream of it  im sorry it was all you im very proud of you  dont you think once they unearth that thing  there would be a swarm of people crashing in from all over the world  why didnt he just lease the land  i dont get it   ive got an idea  what  lets ask him  what  were pretty sure we just found a coldblooded murderer  and you want to go to his house and ask him about it  we can ask nicely no  all right all right we come up with a cover story  were vacuum salesmen  no  traveling gypsies  no no no  well do of mice and men   im lennie  no  george you said that i could take care of those rabbits george  shawn  and later on youre gonna cook those beets   shawn  beets make me go   no lennie  gus you know how long ive been waiting to pull out my lennie  no shawn we do the national paleontology society thing as agreed  and we keep it very very simple  its not as much fun as whipping out my lennie  and why are we stopping here  have you tried these peaches  youre back  yes sir we are  were addicted to your citrus  peaches arent citrus shawn theyre stone fruit   its the same thing  no not the same thing  they have pits peaches cherries plums and apricots  i cant do this with you right now does your fruit come from walker farms  oh no we grow on our own little parcel of land  deacon walkers farm used to be a supplier of ours years ago  but they dont grow nearly as much as they used to  thank you so much for your information  if you have a moment my friend and i would like to buy every peach on that truck  including the one youre eating  you sure you dont want to do of mice and men  you so much as slur one word ill give you an indian burn so hot  your socks will catch fire  indian burn   i havent been threatened with that this millennium  take a shot if your ulna feels safe  i dont think the ulnas in the forearm  trust me it is   how can you indian burn a bone  stop analyzing my threat   get it right  i got it right   deacon walker  sullivan walker  is deacon walker home  there is no deacon walker  thats confusing  ive got nothing gus  then why name the farm deacon walker farms  because it used to be called deacon walker  roger deacon was my partner  hes not anymore  that cleans it up nicely   maybe we come in  no  what do you want  were from the national paleontological society  not interested  clearly hes not interested  we would like to make you  a very sizeable offer on a very small portion of your  hello my name is lennie  i like to  you think hed open up if we knocked again  im glad it only took us an hour to get up here  not like i wasted a whole day  franzen dug up here too  no he didnt  these are all new and dug with a bulldozer  a real paleontologist  would never use such an indelicate tool i got it   so our farmers been digging too  right  but if the gold mines out there why is he digging over here  its my dad  think he wants his leaf blower back  shawn  shawn youre not anywhere near that farmhouse are you  dad how dare you of course not  good stay away shawn  i know where i rember that farm  deacon walker farm i was up there about 20 years ago  a girl reported that her boyfriend went missing  roger deacon  he was a partner in the farm  he was never found shawn  never found  thats right the farmer claimed he went back to england or some nonsense  the point is we never found out where he went  i think i might know where he is  where   i might be looking at him  shawn  gotta go  shawn god   dude  what  it now appears a lot of our evidence is circumstantial  were checking the grad students alibi but  im not as confident as i like to be   shawn spencers on line one  what does he want  he wants us to go meet him in the ojai valley somewhere  were in the middle of the franzen case  i told him that  he guarantees that in ten minutes he can solve the case  nab the killer close an additional unsolved murder and  and what  unearth a dinosaur  well im curious  this is as far as my property goes thats all there is  well ive answered all your questions detective  what more do you want from me   im not entirely sure sir  we just have one more person  we need you to talk to  lennie  lennie  dont even ask  my name is not lennie mr walker  but if it were   i wouldve been amazing  no you wouldnt have  wouldve brought tears gus  guys the point  the truth is  im a psychic  i work for the sbpd  and the mystic vibrations  of the sea have brought me here  to solve not one but two murders  youre a what  christopher franzen was a persistent annoyance huh  he couldnt help it  his department was going under  he was desperate to find something significant  to save his career  and he knew that your property held the key  but you wouldnt let him dig  you couldnt let him dig  so he did what any selfrespecting paleontologist  on the verge of a nervous breakdown would do  he dug anyway  secretly  under the blanket of night  and into the early morning  and he dug and he dug and he found something  and thats when you found him you knew the magnitude  of the find  once word got out youd never be able to keep  the rest of the world from digging here too  and you couldnt have the rest of the world  digging here either could you  shawn  dad  what are you doing here  i was worried  about my tools  what  if i had known you were finally smart enough  to bring some backup i wouldnt have had  to come up here shawn  shawn will you tell them why walker wouldnt let him dig  roger deacon  deacon is buried on the property  dad  dad you just blew the big reveal  you already mentioned his name shawn  no deacon was the partner  walker killed 20 years ago   hey now wait a minute here  he what now  yeah he killed deacon and he buried him  somewhere on the farm and he cant rember where  isnt that right farmer shooty pants  i dont have to stand here and take this  no actually you do  what does this have to do with christopher franzen  he killed franzen when he caught him standing above his  dinosaur skull discovery sending him flying right into  the teeth of the dinosaur  but he couldnt bury him here  no no no he had called the farm  he had snooped around the farm  there was a trail to the farm  no he had to dump him somewhere where thered be no forensics  like the ocean  just let the salt water clean the corpse and wash it ashore  and the murder scene  well he hopped on his handy bulldozer  and filled the hole  im getting a bad feeling about your streak  you too huh  i think i need a lawyer  i think youre right  put your hands behind your back   what  you heard me  you still havent answered the question  why he dug all the holes around the house shawn  dad thats the finale  thats why i dont invite you to these things  he was looking for deacons body  whatever  are we done here mr spencer  no were not done  for my final demonstration  i will now discover a dinosaur  shawn  actually gus will discover a dinosaur  wait a second  you just want me to dig this hole  i do not  im not falling for that shawny boy  you dig it  ill take credit for the discovery  oh no you wont give me that shovel  its too late  you blew it what  and whoever discovers it gets to name it  im naming him zippy  or chompy  zippy the dinosaur discovered by psychic  paleosleuth shawn spencer  give me this shovel shawn  killed by a dinosaur  and hes right  it was an actual dinosaur  technically its the fall  that killed him  not helping  who am i kidding i am doomed  i am never gonna suspect an extinct creature  how can i compete with that  you dont have to compete  ohara i am physically incapable of pointing the finger  at a dragon or a leprechaun or the loch ness monster  i quit im gonna donate my badge to charity  it was a good run carlton all streaks have to end  lou boudreau fielded the ball cleanly  you have to let it go  who the hell is lou boudreau  he recorded the out that ended dimaggios hit streak  dont you watch baseball  of course i watch baseball  i just dont know meaningless   facts from 75 years ago  66  you disturb me  do you need a hug  oh what do i look like  yeah ill take the hug  okay thanks okay  oh come on you guys  were still doing this intervention thing  yes yes shawn we are  son you have no sense of responsibility  and lately youve been purposefully putting yourself  in a severe amount of unnecessary danger  on top of which you are constantly belittling  the good work of actually henry  i stretched the truth a bit  this isnt about shawn   this is about you  what  can we talk about your obsessive need for control  you come into my house devette  you lie to me  lets try to be rational  did you really drive all the way up to ojai just to crash  shawns crowning moment  get out  henry were here for you   at least listen  out now  get out  out  id like to start  when i was about seven he
