transport snacks from the kitchen to your desk  or the reception area whats your point  part of running a business together shawn  is sharing in the responsibilities of the business side of the

fromage  which loosely translated means of cheese  the truth is im actually a psychic  a professional one  and i am getting a major reading right in here  you are   there it goes again  what   whats it saying  its saying that you are a middle child  yes yes i am  it is also saying that you are not  a bank robber   you know this  yes very much so  there is something else at play here phil

had kidnapped you and was holding you somewhere  and if i didnt walk into this bank right then and get him these diamonds  and drop them in a mailbox down the road  he was going to kill you  and i screwed up  and i dont know how to get out of this honey im so sorry  phil that was something  i mean it was just really jampacked with uh information  it was also a little breathy  oddly soothing  she said not to worry  everything is going to be okay  but how   you dont have to  okay yeah  but how  i mean i feel like im being watched  by the cops by someone in here  phil i will help you  but you have to trust me  im working with the police department  i know who all the players are out there  i will get you out of this bank  and i will find out where your wife is  but you have to let me lead this negotiation  do you think you can do that  i think so  okay heres the plan  first keep up the crazy guy routine   we need that  all right  but do not speak to anyone here unless i am with you  secondly  youre going to have to give me some privacy  i wasnt kidding about the orange julius  luntz here  i have some info for you  stubbins is not behind this   someone  look spencer  the first thing you gotta realize about these guys is that they will try to manipulate anybody  they can to get out of there alive  i think that you have interfered and screwed up enough dont you  why dont you find yourself a quiet little corner in there and lay low copy  i im tell  kenny i need to talk to you  yes sir whats up sir   hello  lhasa apsos  i have an idea that might put you back front and center on this case  im listening  stubbins isnt behind the robbery  somebody kidnapped his wife and put him up to it  spencer you know that sounds a little nutsy right  what do you have to lose just send a couple black and whites out to look for the wife and see what blows back  how can you be so sure that sh what was that sound  spencer  hey mcnabb  yes sir  ive got something im going to send you out on  okay  what are we doing in the bank managers office  ive taken the liberty of putting together a list of demands that you can give to luntz   demands  yep  yeah were going to call out there  and youre just going to read these off to him  my demands  by phil  an airplane to take me wherever i want  tour bus blue with full tank of gas   and groupies  thats nonnegotiable  5000 in unmarked bills  this is a huge list  what if they wont give me any of this stuff  i dont expect them to phil  thats just to buy us time  so that we can figure out who in here has put you up to this  a zip line pulley system used to transport  deliciously flavored snacks and such from one location to another  what is this  look just call out to luntz okay  and remember i need to speak to him first  what do you know about this guy other than his name  we know that his house foreclosed on  luntz its phil  hey there friend  i was wondering why i havent heard from you  well im going to put shawn spencer  shawn spencer on the phone  he will be negotiating on my behalf from here on in  no no phil  dont do that thats a mistake   this is between you and me  hey cam  its shawn whats up buddy  spencer put stubbins on the phone now  thats uh  thats going to be a little awkward uh im not really sure how to put this  and bear with me because this is my first hostage negotiation  but it would appear that i am in fact making the demands now  so why dont you go ahead and put detective  ohara on the phone please  why in the worid would i do that  oh i dont know isnt the timbre of my voice telling you why  its spencer  shawn are you all right  jules how serious is this thing with you and luntz really  im so not having this conversation with you right now  is he standing next to you sniffing your hair huh  is he listening to me  shawn half the santa barbara police department can hear us  okay fine youre right  im sorry i dont know what i was thinking  just just answer me this

yeah  okay  first  i need a plane  oh gosh  this bank sucks  wait a minute  youre the bank manager  yes im nathanial gresling  do you recall rejecting a small business loan  for a zip line snack transportation system calling it  and i quote fiscally irresponsible   shawn  yes i do  well mr nathanial gresling  this little task of retrieving the mini oreos took me 14 seconds  zip line foom shh  five  fiscally irresponsible  nay i call that my fiscal obligation to my shareholders namely gus here   shawn  look im sorry  you think that was all my decisin  im just a dupe for the upper management  i dont have the power you think i do  we understand mr gresling  but im still a little fuzzy on the details  do you rember what happened this morning when mr stubbins came to the bank  i remember him entering the bank and he approached me  i was busy with a customer but he caught my attention  he asked me to take him to the safety deposit vault which i did  once inside the vault he drew his gun  how do you suppose he knew about the diamonds  the diamonds were deposited in that particular box one week prior  i very distinctly remember mr stubbins being in the bank that day  how do you distinctly remember that  well the gentleman who deposited the diamonds was a very wealthy customer  who management considers to be a vip client  therefore im instructed to treat him as such  right  mr stubbins was in the bank before  to get to his safety deposit box but i skipped him over  oh that never feels good  he was very upset  he complained  i felt bad for him and  maybe this was my mistake  but i told him that the gentleman was depositing some very valuable merchandise  therefore he knew about the diamonds  dont beat yourself up man its not your fault  thank you very much  god  nothing is agreeing with me today  excuse me im going to have to uh  take care of some more business  phil buddy whatre you doing  theyre going to meet all my demands  seriously even the plane  yeah  what about the snack line  yeah  um they wanted me to come take a look at the bus  its not blue is that okay  yeah  you have a shot take it  thats a negative on the target sir  how did you miss  he just fell out of my scope very strange  free hugs whos next  well were still coming to you from outside the national savings bank  where the hostage situation has escalated  shawn spencer psychic

there by the wife now  all right jules give me one good reason why you find this guy attractive   shawn  you cant give me one  i can think of many  is one of them that youre looking forward to giving him sponge baths in the near future  i happen to find his age and his maturity appealing  hes distinguished and virile and most importantly  he knows who he is  and that is attractive  you two know im in the van right  here stop here  this is it  shes being held right in there  all right spencer  youstay put  i will not be responsible for you  ohara we go on three you ready  one two  can i say it  let me say it  shawn  get back in the car  this could be dangerous  i will but i have to tell you something  shawn get back in the car  go out with luntz   what  i want you to go out with luntz  shawn  what are you trying to pull  im not trying to pull anything i just want you to be happy  so  if you think this guy can make you happy or even if youre not sure  and theres just a tiny part of you  that thinks that there might be a chance for that  i think you owe it to yourself to go for it  thank you shawn  youre welcome  when are you supposed to go out next  uh tonight actually  thats so fast  wheres he going to take you  marios  marios  that place is a little stuffy dont you think  i like their bread   clear  clear   spen  spencer  what the hell are you doing i told you to stay in the car  if id stayed in the car i wouldnt be able to tell you  that someone just took off running that way through the yard  theyre gone  ill call in a perimeter request get k9 down here  you want to help me with this gag  yeah  hello joanna  i have a message from your husband  im going to try to make contact one more time  and then thats it  prepare to go in with the gas  you come on come on right now   why what do you want  right now  dont move dont talk look at the floor  look at the floor  come on right now  right now in here in here   get in there  what   you have my wife  what are you talking about  you know where she is tell me where she is   tell me where she is  i swear youre crazy  wheres my wife  i dont know  all right mrs stubbins what can you tell us about the man that kidnapped you  well there were actually two men  two  are you sure  wheres my wife  i was blindfolded but through a crack in the bottom  i was able to make out two pairs of feet  i didnt see much but  i know one of them was wearing a pair of brown wing tip shoes  i got it the other ones in the bank  i gotta call phil and warn him  thats it men  its go time  hit em with the teargas and go in on my call  morgan phelps is the second man inside the bank  canine caught the guy running away from the house who gave them up  but i dont get the bank manager  gresling knew the bank was going to be robbed  he planned the whole thing from the beginning  he knew that his vip client had dropped off the diamonds  the diamonds were deposited in that particular box one week prior  he figured this was his chance to score big  so he contacted morgan phelps  who has a rap sheet as long as my arm  so why didnt phelps just steal the diamonds himself  they didnt need a professional bank robber  because gresling would basically just be handing the diamonds over  and phil was a perfect mark  they could put him in the bank on the day the diamonds were delivered  that plus the back taxes and the recent foreclosure  made him seem like a really desperate guy who need cash in a big way  so phelps plants himself at the bank to make sure everything goes smoothly  and then finds himself caught as a hostage when the whole deal goes south  ill keep trying luntz  but im pretty sure hes blocked all calls not coming from inside the bank  we need to get back there before he goes in  luntz  have your guys grab gresling the bank manager  take him into custody hes in on it   were looking for phelps  who  phelps have you accounted for all the hostages  were counting bodies now its a mess out here  all right  theres no wing tips  phelps is gone he mustve taken off somewhere  when did you last see him  we were being held in a back room   i know where phelps is  where  hes in the sewer hes in the sewer system   thats ridiculous  is it luntz  all right i do know this much  if someone were to access the sewer system out back  it would dump them almost anywhere in the city  luntz im a psychic  youre just going to have to trust me  plus listen to my voice  its even its steady no vibrato  gus quick help me boost lassie up to the ceiling   phelps is inside one of these ducts  what  whatever happened to the whole psychic sewer visin thing  lassie do we really have time to answer these questions  now come on just give me one of those size 12 narrows  freeze  come here  hold still  i got him  good work partner  well grab backup  partner  uh excuse me what was that about  you got to admit its better than a little boy cat  or a little girl cat  not appreciated shawn  but look at you man  surviving a bank hostage crisis and still looking all  poitier on a hot day  what  go ahead slap me in the face  tell me they call you mr tibbs   im not doing that  come on  itll make you feel better  they call me mr
