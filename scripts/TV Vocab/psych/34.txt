two grand    you know the allman brothers generally tend to inhibit my psychic powers  so why dont you just tell me  is there anyone thatd like to see your dad bite the bullet  just about everybody that comes to the show  anyone in here in particular have a grudge with him   against my dad  yeah  no way everybody here loves him  cant understand why anyone would want to hurt him  in fact ive been trying to get him to retire altogether  why doesnt he listen  give up the spotlight  give up the applause  the love  never  besides well my dad thinks hes unkillable  but hes wrong  hes flesh and blood  my flesh and blood  thats why im counting on you boys  okay let me let me introduce you to my dad  do we have our cover stories yet  dont worry i take care of all the finances and hirings  pop found us the two new diehards you asked for  damn already  actually im diehard  hes dieharder  we have two other guys in our crew  but they arent nearly as good as us  well how the hell you do that so quick  especially after what happened to that last bunch  excuse me what happened to the last bunch  well we cant talk about it for legal reasons  all i know is our attorney said that  it aint decapitation if the head dont come off all the way  i joke i joke  he better be  thats morbid  hi im viki  dutchs wife  now you boys have experience right  its up to you to keep my man safe  thats right  hey whats the most dangerous thing you boys done  we eat at taco johns with some frequency  so that puts us right there on the edge  oh we got ourselves a couple of comedians  i like that  okay you boys got the job  oh damn  did you just break your wrist  yeah well its okay  nothing busted through the skin  dad maybe you should take a break  i mean you almost got killed today  oh come on son  you just worry about your own safety  ill be fine  well maybe louis is right  and we can finally take that vacation  to dollywood  uh not to overstep  but i think you may still have a concussin from earlier  concussin  hell ive had a concussin since 1982  true story  anybody elses beer taste like metal  sunday dont miss el diablo  who the hell put that on there  okay did we miss something  hell thats el diablo  what is an el diablo  hes nobody  just some wannabe daredevil  no one knows who he is because he always wears a mask  right there see that right there  thats why we cant take no damn vacation  that son of a bitch is right on my heels  relax dad  hes amateur hour compared to you  dutch forget about el diablo  i got you that canyon jump in september  rock on manny  i told you clutch  explosions crashes  thats what people pay to see  you keep that up im gonna get you on tv  and it wont be that infomercial for the home stomach pump  this is gonna be one of those rain delay filler shows  dad please  its too soon to be adding new stunts  oh bull piss  aint nobody telling me i cant do anything no more  i think that was the worst english ive ever heard  all right  200 that im gonna take a fall        glen campbell rocks  oh damn i spilled my beer  it might be harder to keep this guy alive than i thought  you need me chief  why is someone lodging a complaint against my head detective  thats the third one this month  hes just going through a rough patch right now  hell be fine  i think hes having some serious dating problems  you know when i used to work vice  my partner was an alcoholic  and one night i went over to his house  handcuffed him to a radiator  and made him dry out  and when he finally sobered up  i gave him a choice  go into department rehab program or chew your hand off for freedom   he chose the program  is that a real story  maybe it is maybe i saw it on an old police woman rerun  the point is ohara  sometimes its up to the cops partner to keep their head above water huh  to do whats necessary to make sure that they stay on course  get me  yes chief  hmm this is for you  whats wrong  chief just gave me some really weird advice  well what does she want  well i cant be sure but  i think she wants me to find lassiter a girlfriend  good luck with that  that makes sense  i guess  thanks louis  so dutch doesnt have a will  because apparently invincible people do not need them  what is all this  those are forms that must be filled out so that we can be diehards  just sign them  these release the employer from any liability  in case the stunt tester is torn to shreds  stunt tester  is that what were doing are you crazy  trust me and be cool  wait this one is in case were accidentally  chewed to death by a malfunctioning robot  oh hell no  relax well be fine  deboned  killed and rekilled  how does that even work  gus dont be an old sponge with hair hanging off it  im all over this case  mimed to death   thats clearly a typo they meant maimed   what are we gonna be killed by marcel marceau  marcel marceau is dead  see theres nothing to worry about  we are solving this case shawn  before we have to do any of this stuff  fair  ive been checking out this el diablo guy  he always rolls into town the day after dutch  and theyve been competing for the same gigs for almost a year  including that canyon jump that dutch just got  all right motive  wipe out dutch and the field is clear  and el diablo is a daredevil  so he would know how to sabotage the stunts to make it look like an accident  ill buy that  and someone at the party told me that  el diablo performed at the fair the night before dutch  when dutchs team was no doubt prepping for their stunt  youre saying they had access to dutchs equipment  im sold  hes our guy  so where is he  where do we find this el diablo  how do you feel about checking out some old antique motorcycles  they call this a motorcycle show  theres like four motorcycles here  they dont even have the bike from blue thunder  that was a helicopter  youre right  i was thinking of blue lagoon  there wasnt a bike in blue lagoon  howd they get off the island gus  yo el diablo  whats up man  shawn spencer  this is my partner squirts macintosh  just have a couple sort of serious questions for you  on no no no you dont have to get on the bike  dude hes running  international sign of guilt  lets go quick  get in the sidecar  are you out of your damn mind  im not getting in that thing you get in there  gus you have absolutely no idea how to drive a motorcycle  get in the sidecar  dude its like high road to china  what are you doing  were going were going  jeez  louis  youre el diablo  louis  that is the sexiest thing ive ever seen  shut up shawn  youre guilty of attempted patricide  and you tried to kill your own dad  i never tried to kill anyone  you really think id hire detectives if i wanted to bump off my own dad  what kind of psychic are you  the kind that loves bees and historical novels  the kind that knows a lie when he hears one  and knows that only the guilty make a run for it  the only thing i am guilty of is not telling my dad that i do this too  and i ran because i dont want you two exposing my secret  why hide it  my dad forbids me from being a daredevil  because he didnt want me to get hurt  do you know what its like to have your father  tell you not to follow in his footsteps  i wish  i did this because i care about my dad  as soon as el diablo starts making some noise and he knows im legit  then ill tell him  then maybe hell let me take over the family business and finally retire  hopefully before he gets really hurt  psychic visin incoming  i see colors on your hands  on your bike  on your hands  my daughter my sister  my father the hero  yeah i repainted my bike recently  i had paint on my hands  repainted why  because you stole it from your dad  i borrowed it  dad was supposed to use this in the last jump  but manny got us a sponsor and a new bike  tech specs said the new bike was way safer  left this one for me  who the hell is manny  the agent  look you guys arent gonna tell him who i am right  its a sensitive subject  he wont understand it right away  i just want him to come to grips with  this is what i am  i didnt choose it  yeah  i had a similar experience with my dad when i told him i  wanted to take gus here to the prom  come on you and me at the prom  no misfire  okay  so the exploding motorcycle was provided at the last minute  by dutchs agent manny  who probably slapped those sponsor decals on himself  id say that warrants investigation  doesnt make sense  why would an agent risk his clients life  isnt that his money train  remember the after party  i told you clutch  explosions crashes  thats what people pay to see  manny may not be trying to kill dutch  but hes making the stunts more dangerous  to add a little pizzazz to dutchs act  which in turn gets dutch more gigs  which in turn is only increasing mannys 10  which in turn makes me wonder why you would use the word pizzazz  what are you doing  ill give you an aplus for the skulking  but a cminus for the leering  i have to find lassiter a date for the weekend  ive narrowed it down to three prospective candidates  jules why would you possibly want to jump into that snake pit  vick ordered me to  all right  would you like me to give your candidates the psychic once over  if you have to  im sensing itll be easier to get a stranger to go out with him  than someone he works with  or knows him  or has ever had a conversation with him  or he hasnt shot  one more question are we locked into the same species  enough already  what are you guys doing here  we need a background check on manny robertson  oh i know that name  yeah weve had him in here a few times on some getrichquick scams  why him  im getting a very strong vibe off him  on this awesome daredevils case were working  daredevils really  theyre still around  dont dont do that  dont hate on the devils  i just ii never got it personally  i mean ooh i can jump over a flaming trashcan   i mean why do people care  allow me  what is he doing  wait for it  wait for it  whats up  gus gus gus  im okay im okay  im okay  need any more proof  no i got it  im fine  we need to find manny as soon as possible  we should have a little breathing room actually  if mannys our mad saboteur  he wont strike until he has an audience  during the actual stunt  not during rehearsal  exactly  next stunts tomorrow  a jump closing night of the fair  dutch should be safe till then  clutch  or not  holy  are you all right  what  are you all right  should we call the cops or the ambulance  what the hell for  ive done that stunt a thousand times  that was just a rehearsal  now its your turn  come on i got you set up over at the stadium  you know dutch  seeing as how gus and i are just getting started  a couple questions about representation  namely your agent manny  first we rehearse  then i gotta strip viki down and oil her joints  wow not too shy about your wife are you  im talking about my bikes  i name em all after my wife  maybe we could just talk to manny himself  whereabouts is he  ill call him later  after i give viki a lube job and pull her nuts  hey guys come on  we gotta get ready for that catapult stunt  you boys ready to work  strip and put these on  all right this ones easy  all you gotta do is stand here  how the hell are we supposed to help dutch when were stuck doing this stuff  as long as were making sure the stunts are safe he cant get killed  ill make it safe for me outside  you need to man up  id put these masks on if i was you  what for  what is this an underwater stunt or something  wait is that gasoline  you must be out of your damn mind  well we had to see how fire retardant these suits were  you didnt know that before you tried to set us on fire  what do you think youre getting paid for  dutch dutch  great news baby  apparently some crazy fan ran el diablo off the road  at the classic bike show and he injured his shoulder  he cant do the clock tower death drop stunt and i got it for you  rock on manny  all right were gonna have to rig these  no no no time to rehearse  thank you lord  the time of the event was already advertised  if we want it we gotta do it now  you up for it dutch  what are you kidding  hell one time i bungee jumped off a building twice as high as that tower  and even though the bungee cord snapped on the way down  i still made it to the george thorogood concert that night  true story  yes sir  were gonna make some money dutch  no rehearsal  thats convenient  mannys rushing dutch into another stunt unprepared  another stunt  another chance for sabotage  what is going on  apparently dutch is going to jump from the building  spread his arms  and glide down to that large pillow  all live on camera for some daredevil web site  red  you see that  yes  now im in the mood for some coffee  what are you talking about  coffee shawn   what are you looking at  the same thing youre looking at  its a dunkin donuts patch gus  and they have excellent coffee  they have one on my extended route  you know what dude you astound me  and now i must have a blueberry crumb  its totally triggered my donut launch sequence  will you focus shawn  i cant  no dont jump  jeez  what the hells wrong with you  everythings wrecked now  are you all right baby  grab my hand grab my hand  gus  you couldve killed my husband you idiot  got you  idiot  how about mindblowing genius  dutch please  spread your arms the way you would in the middle of the stunt  i dont take orders from nimrods like you  dutch do it  do it  if you wouldve jumped you wouldve died  the jump cant stunt as that you tried to pull out there  nobody steals my spotlight nobody  youre just damn lucky manny  pulled me off that roof before i got a chance to throw you off it  dutch im gonna level with you  were not really professional stuntmen  now that would explain all the screaming  so what the hells going on  uh were um uh   animal activists  right  and that is the truth  we are here to stop you from abusing any more large  impressive exotic game in your act  shame on you dutch the clutch  i aint got no animals in my act  well that settles that  gus and i will be going  sit down  now the next thing that comes out of your mouth better be the truth  otherwise were gonna start rehearsing that bury you alive stunt  were detectives  hes a psychic we were hired by your son  dad i can explain  im a christian man  what the hell are you trying to do getting me  all mixed up in that voodoo dark force stuff  he  we think that someone is trying to sabotage your stunts  lets just hear em out  have you guys found anything  yes we think that its  were not sure who it is yet exactly  thats because nobodys trying to kill me  news flash  almost dyings par for the course for my line of work  dutch someone tampered with that gliding suit  the spirits are sure of it  that gliding suit tore  because i bought it during the gliding suit boom in 1977  and that fall wouldnt have killed me  damn one time i jumped out a blimp 500 feet in the sky  had a heart attack on the way down  two hours later  i was eating a blt in a red robin  true story  dutch please listen to us  no you listen to me  because im only gonna say it one time  youre fired  red help these boys out  wait a second whoa red  huh so were not gonna shoot gus out of a cannon later  no okay okay  theres something i love about these lowrent stakeouts  all you gotta do is snap some pictures of a guy with some stolen merchandise  why didnt you wear the burgundy turtleneck  because it didnt occur to me to change for a stakeout   why  no reason  i just i really like you in that burgundy turtleneck  and with short hair  and you know what else a little cologne wouldnt kill you  all right you think i dont know whats going on here  look ive noticed youre kind of  checking me out at the squad and asking about my dating habits  its not a big deal its just  listen it is perfectly normal  for a junior officer to develop  feelings for her superior  someone she feels is a mentor and  oh no  no no  oh my god no  ohara its okay  no no vick ordered me to find you a girlfriend   what  yeah  you know weve noticed that youve been on edge lately  and thought it might help  and i have this friend you can meet later who likes cops  i dont believe this  thats a total invasin of my privacy  not to mention unprofessional  so what i sleep alone  so what if i saw a frozen dinner in half  before i microwave it every night  so what if i seriously considered planting evidence on my wifes new boyfriend  i mean thats  i could just  oh god i may need your help  thats all i want to do  oh damn im not getting a signal  all right im gonna go find a hot spot  and then when i get back  ill tell you all about my friend  why didnt you tell them about manny  because its not him  when manny was adjusting dutchs suit before the stunt  he whispered something in his ear  i of course  read his lips  he said he didnt want him wearing that gliding suit  he wanted him to wear the black one because it was far more slimming  and then he said  purple camel lawnmower man   how the hell are we supposed to help dutch now that weve been banished  im gonna go over there and start working on it  youre wasting energy shawn  do you see solar panels up in here  come on now you guys gotta hurry  next stunt is coming up fast  dadll kill me if he finds out i let you back in here  dont worry louis well be as nonexistent as an aldo nova fan  so what are we looking for  red  when he gave us the heaveho  i saw an old tattoo on his arm  first four letters spelled viki  but in a slightly different  so  so he was probably seeing her before she married dutch right  she leaves him  he gets a different tattoo artist to add the ngs  to conceal it from his boss  maybe reds trying to eliminate the competion  bingo  let me go first   im more stealthy  in your dreams  im as graceful as a gazelle shawn  you are not a jackal  dude a jackal is not graceful  its like a rabid  vicious badger  now what is that  this is it  i bet you thats a bomb  and hes gonna put it on one of the bikes  come on red  lets get this over with  what the heck  dude why would someone take  gemacetabine  or capsitonabine  wow you were nowhere close on the pronunciation   what are they for  those two together  you probably got pancreatic cancer   prognosis  not good  its pretty terminal  hes dying  so red is not the bad guy he wouldnt smuggle in drugs  to help dutch and then turn around and kill him  this case is bizarre  why kill someone if hes already dying  that begs the question  who knows hes dying  we dont come up with something soon hes a goner  we need to know who stands to gain from dutchs death  and for that we need his will  but louis said there was no will  he doesnt know his dads dying gus  if you were dying of cancer  wouldnt you have a will  are you kidding  ive had my estate planner on speed dial  ever since we started this stupid business  do you know how many times ive had a gun shoved in my face because of you  three  wrong answer  were never gonna find it  wait a minute  theres something weird with this tile  looks fine to me  no no no  the patterns off just a little bit  like someone pried one up and put it down wrong  bingo  is that his will  its just as good  life insurance policy  that doesnt make any sense  tell me about it  dude seriously  tell me about it i have no idea what this means  you never could understand legalese  oh really remind me who it was that set up our psych 401k  oh you mean our 601ks  because india doesnt have 401ks  its a growth economy gus  weve already made like 500 rupee  thats 13  man just tell me what i need to know  shh do i rush you when youre doing you whole  ooh im sensing this im sensing that  always  and you usually jab me in the ribs with your elbow  which is like a chocolate harpoon   are you finished  maybe  on first read  it says if dutch dies of natural causes  theres barely a payout  that doesnt make any sense for someone whos always putting himself at risk  but dutch has a unique indemnity policy  if he dies during one of his stunts  his beneficiaries receive 12 million  who are the beneficiaries  his wife and his son  gus i know who our killer is  and it is a packed house here for tonights main event  the legendary dutch the clutch jenkins and his most dangerous stunt ever  we are moments away from show time  ladies and gentlemen  what the hell are you doing here  i thought i fired your ass  i just came to apologize to you dutch  for what  i was wrong about you  all this time i thought you were the kid who shot milk out of his eye  you know willing to do just about anything for attention  regardless of how it effects the people around you  but thats thats not the case is it  son im getting tired of the sound of your gums flapping  youre all about family  arent you dutch  you love em more than life  thats why youve been trying to kill yourself  i sensed a dark cloud over you  youre terminally ill  im sorry man  it must be so scary knowing that youre gonna die  especially when youre all that your family has  and thats why you took out that special insurance policy  the one that only you know about  now all you gotta do is make sure that you die in the middle of a stunt  and your family gets a windfall  right  it shouldve been a simple matter of you sabotaging your own stunts  but dutch  youre a victim of your own talent  you actually are a little unkillable  even with all your faulty mechanics  your instincts kicked in and prevented you from failing  its almost show time folks  dutch the clutch jenkins is here to perform a gravity defying spectacle  look i know this is your last stunt for awhile  and thats my fault  if this disease gets you before your next show  your family gets nothing  so im sure whatever your method is tonight  its foolproof  what are you gonna do now  nothing  im not gonna try and stop you  and i will not say anything if you go through with it  you have my word  just let me leave you with this dutch  it doesnt take a psychic to see how much people love you  your son came to me  and hired a psychic against his better judgment to keep you alive  and you dont know this yet  but all he wants in the worid is to be more like you  you go to your son  or your wife  or anyone on your crew for that matter  and you ask them which theyd rather have  six more months with you or a million dollars  you know damn well what theyll answer  and they wont have to think about it for a second  is that right  true story  youre wrong  i was that kid in class who shot milk out of his eyes  and i was damn good  and here he is now  dutch the clutch jenkins  and hes off  speeding down the ramp  hes past the point of no return  its all or nothing  he did it  a hundred wagons  give it up fantastic  a victory lap around the arena  what a night  youve witnessed history here tonight folks  ladies and gentlemen  lets hear it  no really  you you grew up your whole life in santa barbara  yeah  i cannot believe that  thats amazing thats fascinating  what are you doing  oh im just talking to your friend blair here  she shes great  we have so much in common  shes not my friend  what do you mean you didnt send her down here to meet me  no  i dont invite friends to dangerous stakeouts  but i know her shes a professional  please tell me youre a hit man  oh carlton  so are we gonna do this or not  i gotta go  so i guess were not on for saturday huh   napisy24
