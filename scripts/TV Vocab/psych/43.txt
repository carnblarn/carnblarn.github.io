                dad dad   dad dad dad  wait whoa  slow down slow down fire  dad youll never believe it  i know what i wanna be when i grow up  a fireman  i never woulda guessed  what exactly brought this on  fireman paul  he came to our school he is so totally rad  fireman paul  did he happen to be sober  shawn come here  listen to me  you  you do not wanna be a fireman  what why not  because you wanna be a cop  what do you think ive been teaching you all these years  but being a fireman is the coolest  being a fireman is not cooler than being a cop  well they have cooler uniforms  cooler trucks and cooler sirens  they even get to carry axes  axes i get to carry a gun  a real gun with real bullets  i get to shoot bad guys  im like dirty harry  can you even name a famous fireman  smokey the bear  first of all smokey the bear is not a fireman  number two hes not real  number three hes a bear  he takes his poops in the woods  is that what you want  fireman paul said youd say that  what is going on in there  she never closes her blinds  you know i dont like being out of the loop  shawn whatre you doing  jules  how bout an update on this blind situation  oh just some case with the fire department or something  fire department did you hear that  of course i did im standing  so whats the scoop  well apparently some building burned down last week on benedetto  under suspicious circumstances and theyre looking for backup  sorry guys i gotta go  dude thats us were backup  what   i strongly believe  excuse us  were looking for the fireman  hes probably wearing a yellow or red hard hat  maybe carrying an axe possibly a large bucket of sand  and a dalmatian  discounting your interruption to a closeddoor meeting  miss conrad is the citys arson inspector   arson  miss  hello   arson thats fire  yes  shawn spencer  head psychic sbpd  im available  for cases as well  um im not gonna do that  i understand  obsessivecompulsive  if youre finished mr spencer  wed like to proceed with our meeting so  ah how rude of me  id like to look at the criminal activity for that area   i believe her  what  im sensing that lassie  is skeptical that this is arson  of course im skeptical shes an arson investigator  they always want it to be arson keeps their job viable  can i go now  all i need is access to some of your files for the last few years   i can do that for you  what  come on chief i know where the file room is  besides when you get down there things can get tricky  some of those drawers stick  who gave you access to the file room  irrelevant and immaterial  chief youre not gonna let him do that thing  where he only uses courtroom jargon are you  mr spencer  he is making a mockery of these proceedings all im saying is that  she is making a very compelling argument  youre an idiot  thats less compelling move to strike   please remove him  good  sidebar miss conrad  i think i can help you  you have no idea why im here  im sensing something happened on benedetto street  and youre not getting the support you want from your department  and youre looking for a little outside assistance  thats actually spoton  yes i know  chief i believe we have a match made in heaven  crap  this place is like completely burned  its called a fire shawn  and its all evidence so dont touch anything  all right  ill try to speak slowly  lets review  i believe the fire started in this general area  and spread in this direction  conrad  whatre you doing here  now youre dragging the cops down here  and this is  army johnson fire prevention bureau  and your supervisor in case you forgot   well if this is arson then  look at the bureau  we have a policy of supporting our rookies  rookies  so i gave you a lot of latitude on this case  i read your report and i surveyed the scene myself  it looks like an accidental fire to me not malicious arson  i respectfully disagree  honey  the last time this city had an arsonist  was so long ago i was still on the big red truck  besides this building had no fire insurance  so no one profits  a firebug doesnt need a motive  yeah enough  just finish your report  now im late for my hot yoga class  im teaching this year  an accident  is there something were missing here  well we did find some empty liquor bottles and cigarette butts  around the fires point of origin but  and weve had several reports  of teenagers looking for places to party  i think lassies on to something  have we ruled out teenagers who meet in abandoned buildings  and make banas foster  it is not teenagers  one of the firemen remembers smelling  a distinct sweet odor while putting out the fire  and that is a sign of a stronger accelerant than alcohol  and if this is a firebug  he is just getting started  dude  that wall over there doesnt have any insulation  i think thats an external wall  look if no one from your department is on board  im on board  gus whats happening to me  what the hell are you doing  theres something off with this wall right here  i can feel it   oh my god  what the  did not see that coming  miss conrad this wasnt just arson  it was murder  wwwsubsteamtv presents  in between the lines theres a lot of obscurity  im not inclined to resign to maturity  if its all right then youre all wrong  but why bounce around to the same damn song  youd rather run when you cant crawl  i know you know that im not telling the truth  i know you know they just dont have any proof  embrace the deception learn how to bend  your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end  psych  s03e12 earth wind and wait for it  synch by safes  im sensing that this man  is it a man  i dont i dont know what it is  yes based on the pelvic girdle  burned to death hell of a way to go  he didnt burn to death me pulled a 22 slug out of his sternum  he was shot then burned  its sad but thats what they do to guys who wear girdles  this man is the reason the fire was set  according to the mes preliminary report  the bullet entered the body at a downward trajectory  based on bone fragments containing lead residue  see so from behind and downward means our shooter  dropped him down on his knees  popped him execution style bang  you trim that fingernail ming the merciless  then the killer torched the building to make the body unidentifiable  or to remove any trace of his own fingerprints or dna  we couldnt even pull a print off the bullet smart move  in case you missed it detective  this is my i told you so face  which is kind of hard to distinguish from your  i thought this was gonna be a new episode of law and order  but turns out its a repeat face  a dead body changes things  thats his email signature  so were on board and because its a homicide its our investigation  no its arson and ive already briefed army on all of this  he says its my case im on point you report to me  look when we find our murder youll find your arsonist  no when i find my arsonist ill find your murderer   no  guys please  cant we come up with a term that covers both killer and arsonist  how about arsassin  the skeleton had trace amounts of methylbenzene  the primary component of tnt  you can get it at any hardware store and it has a sweet odor  all right fine but no one  outside this room can know we recovered a skeleton  and make sure the city treats the site like an accident   all right i want our killer  arsassin   or karsonist  arsassin  i want the killer to feel safe  i want him to think that his plan worked  secondly  the key to solving this case is to figure out who this guy was  come here often  you know you could afford to slow down a little  you walk any faster youre gonna travel through time  so whats our next move  well i assume were gonna team up right  travel crosscountry solving mysteries  maybe set up shop on the side of the road  form a bluegrass trio  look i appreciate you guys getting the cops to take this seriously  but you dont have a lot of experience with this  so i prefer to handle point alone  you know  sun tzu says that teamwork can be very sensual  ill email you the rest  id go after her if she wasnt walking at cougar speeds  right so whatre we doing are we really done  gus dont be william zabka from back to school  we need to get in with the firemen that put out the fire  shotgun on fire pole  you cant call shotgun on a fire pole  and why them  i think were looking for a fireman  someone who knows fires someone who knows the system  they started the fire somewhere else  then moved the flames towards the victim  because the first thing an arson inspector looks for  is a point of origin  okay  how in the world do you know all that  i rode the back draft ride at universal studios like 74 times  shawn you cant base a whole theory on a movie  theres a movie  now when we get in here dont do that thing you used to do when we were kids  hi fireman  help you  shawn spencer  hunting an arsonist  step anthony wally ali  cat stuck in a tree  conrad told me about you the psycho  psychic  but before we get down to business  is fireman paul around  we heard he used to work outta here back in the day  we just wanna say hello he came to our school when we were kids  no were sure hed rember us  gus accidentally peed on him and i gave him impetigo  over here  died fighting the renkel fires of 98  set by a bunch of vandals  so you think its arson too  you been canoodling with conrad  is conrad a canoodler  did she say anything about me can i get her note through you  im not sure i like random people interrogating my men  especially based on psychic hokum  hokum  well that hokum found traces of methylbenzene at the scene   really  yeah so  my colleague would like to try and glean more hokum from your men  listen its been a long day my shift is over manetti  manettis my righthand man  these guys are here about the fire deal with it would ya  so you were the guys who put out the fire a week ago  that was us  thanks to manetti here  well thats a given  you dont look old enough to operate a hose  we doused that fire in 33 minutes  really  you know dominos can still get you a pizza in under 30  that might be more impressive  yeah well you shouldve seen how fast  i booked the perps back in my cop days  wow well were policeaffiliated too  so can we ask you a few questions  we dont have time starting traing drills  perfect were supposed to do them with you  really who told you that  yeah it sounded weird to us too but its  imperative that we get this information as soon as possible  its a headquarters thing look between you and me  theres nothing wed rather do less  so why dont you just grab us a couple of these costumes and well get it over with  you mean uniforms  ive heard it both ways  can i ring the bell  move move  come on come on get moving downhill  this way youre going down hill move it move it  so how many people did you pull out of the fire  none building was empty  keep moving move it move it go go go  did you notice anything weird about the fire besides the smell oh  lotta open spaces no furniture cluttering up the joint  hey this isnt a picnic move go go go go  nope i didnt see anyone suspicious in the crowd  i questioned him already shawn  dude he was doing the pole  did anyone miss their shift that night  no  no one wants to lose out on the ot  anybody here with a criminal record  shh no talking it kills the illusion  how much more of this do i have to take  man in order for him to stay certified in cpr  he has to practice on a live person  hes gonna use a tongue guard when he gives you mouthtomouth   so its not even really like kissing  what  if you find yourself becoming aroused dont beat yourself up  you must be outta your damn mind  everybody move it  this isnt part of the drill lets go  no shawn  the arsonist might still be there and were already geared up  they wont even know im driving the truck  we should stay here get some gelato  and read the fire departments reports  from the comfort of our notonfire office  dude if we go  you can drive behind a speeding fire truck  all right repeat after me  we are not going into a burning building  we are notnot going into a burning building  break  hey  thought you said your shift was over  i heard about it on my scanner what is this halloween  why you got candy  ill take some good  plenty or good  fruity  how bad is it in there  i havent been inside im patrolling the scene from out here  so just try to stay outta the way all right  this is command first floor is secure  im sending more men to the second floor alpha side over  no shawn were not going into a burning building you promised   actually i didnt  yes you did  the first floor is secure  those things flare back up all the time  and you know how fires attracted to me  can you blame it  man look at you  blair underwood cant touch you right now  blair underwood never played a fireman either  exactly come on i need the super sniffer  shawn  this is not a good idea shawn  shawn  dammit  ii dont know  maybe we should try uh  gus where are you  down here  the key is to stay underneath the smoke  would you get up  start sniffing  theres something sweet in the air  i need to see what the ceiling looked like before it was scorched  anything else  nope  were good  in all the years of fighting fires  that was the dumbest thing i have ever seen  if i was still a cop id put you both in jail  i definitely smelled something  this fire was not an accident  ill do you one better  the chief had flakes of the unburned ceiling in his hair  he was in there before the fire started  weve found our arsonurder  what  firearsmen  senor pantalones de fuego  your psychic hunch was right shawn  this body was found in a wall space at the site of the fire  yes  i could sense that the fires were related  and since the first one was set to cover up murder  there might be a body at the second fire too  nice work  im sorry  it was either nice work or ice fork  but i couldnt tell which  according to the mes report  theres a unique purple rubber melted in between the victims toes   unique how  it has real specks of gold in it  they think it came from the victims sneakers  purple and gold specks thats jet jaguars  gus owned them  theyre the ugliest and most uncomfortable sneakers known to man  i had a pair they werent that bad  they were proven to cause polio  i have elongated metatarsals and inverted phalanges spencer  i have to wear whatever fits  well then you know they were only sold in 98  and then discontinued immediately  the victim was wearing tenyearold sneakers  who holds onto tennis shoes for that long  especially painful purple and gold ones  if this man was wearing them at the time of his death  then he was definitely killed in 98  possibly by the fashion mafia  ten years ago that makes no sense  why would someone hang onto a body for a decade  and then burn it to a crisp  unless  the bodies have been there the whole time  just rotting for ten years thats your theory  actually come to think of it both buildings were built in 98  an empty construction site is a good place to kill someone  and itd be easy to slip a body behind the drywall  what  youre sure youre not a germaphobe  all right lets just confirm the sneaker thing and if spencers right  lets get a list of all the buildings that were built ten years ago  what  you can just get a list of that kind of stuff  id like a list of all available zoltar machines  for a little 14yearold friend of mine  thanks jules  so miss conrad  anything else i should know about the second fire  just that the firefighters caught a break  because there wasnt sufficient ventilation on the top floor  without the oxygen the men had no trouble putting out the fire   yeah that was us  thanks to manetti here  we doused that fire in 33 minutes  so both fires went out relatively easily  i guess yeah  are you thinking what im thinking  i will bet every penny i have that im not  the arsonist made the fires easy to put out  have you at all considered that this is an inside job  well this building wasnt insured either the owners dont get anything  inside your department  a firefighter  whatre you doing  do you see a bruise on my chest from all that cpr  all i see is chocolate with hair on it  you know the rules shawn  no sliding down the pole while im not here  but you are here youre right here  you know what i mean  especially when im stuck tailing fire chief dan all day  and they dont even have a dalmatian here shawn  would you stop with the dalmatians already  im just saying itd be nice to see one in his natural habitat  theyre not indigenous to firehouses gus  did you find anything out or not  well i hid in a corner while he got a picture framed  of him   john denver and the muppets  muppets   hey gonzos was the shot boy  what  sounds productive  then i just had to stand around while he spent an hour  figuring out what type of rotiller to buy  well its not an easy decision gus after all  its harvest season pa  jeb cant work the plow  you know he aint been right since he come down with the consumption  will you stop shawn  it did get interesting  hes our guy and i know it  he was on his cell phone constantly  and i think i heard him ask about the accelerant  after that  he came rushing back here in a panic  dude its sabotage  hes making it harder for the men to put out the fires  we gotta stop him  hes heading to the allpurpose room  theres only one exit to that room  heres the plan we corner we confront  he confesses  we get samosas  bet  dude is that really necessary  i dont play with killers shawn  hello children  yes  field trip to the old fire station  whatre you two doing  we are here to help with the lesson  clearly  so uh kiddies  always rember to put out your cigarettes  when youre finished smoking them  uh excuse me  uh i mean  dont smoke  uh in bed  or in restaurants  or in   caves  no smoking  absolutely no smoking  and dont listen to anyone who says that a pipe is cool  because im telling you it is not  get out get out get out  well that was a waste of time  or was it  what is that  i accidentally mixed up fire chief dans phone with mine  theyre similar shapes and my hand was in his jacket pocket  you stole his phone  he was throwing us out  gus i plead the third  the third amendment is no soldier  can live in your house against your will   you mean the fifth  ive heard it both ways  what other ways have you heard it  just look at this  five calls in a row to hardware stores all over the city  where one might go to buy methylbenzene  thats what im talking about  fire chief dan  honestly  thats why you brought me down to this death trap  death trap  this office is in violation of almost every fire safety code on the books  not to contradict but  we are 100 up to code  i dont walk into a building unless its safe  much less work in one  your smoke detector is a paper bowl with an mm stuck to it  shawn wheres the ryerson smoke detector i bought for the office  oh that thing it kept beeping during seance week  where is it now  charleston chew  charleston chew  you also have an overloaded socket and a hotplate on the ground  i like soup i wont apologize for that  its next to a stack of old newspapers  i also like to read while i eat  can you please just tell me why you think its dan  well its not like i stole his cell phone or anything  cause i mean i dont do that sort of thing  although im sensing someone did ill solve that later  no this this was just deeplyrooted  psychic vibage  i know its hard to believe  no actually its not  it kinda makes sense  he never thought it was arson  and he hated it when i questioned his men  what did the cops say  we havent told them  we thought youd like to make the bust  after all this is your case  that  i mean to say that  i mean that that you would think of me  that you would do that  this seems like a great opportunity for a hug cmere  no   rotator cuff  right  theres been another fire  with another body  forensics is on the way  another body you were right  as a courtesy i want to let you know my office  is going to be bringing in dan trombly for questioning   the fire chief  correct  that could be a problem  why  because  that skeleton wasnt the only body we found  lift that please  it says here that the fire chief died of asphyxiation  smoke inhalation  oh im getting something  how much more of this do i have to endure  do you see the bruise on my chest from all that cpr  there was someone else there they tried to give him cpr before he died  maybe someone who knew him  of course they knew him its like practically kissing him  what the hell was the fire chief doing there in the first place  i mean i dont think he started the fire  he wasnt wearing any protective gear  there werent any traces of accelerants on him  we got a break  the latest skeleton is still too burned to get an id  but our killer didnt know that  our victim had an iced in his body  ew they make those for men  its like a pacemaker  tracked the serial number back to central coast components  who sold it to saint marys  who implanted it into our victim 12 years ago  okay what do we know about our victim  wait our skeleton was a criminal  thats right his name is steven j renkel  as in the kid from family matters   no  as in the renkel fires of 98   yes  guys bring it in  so our victim is a firestarter himself  yeah they were a bunch of vandals who liked going around and starting fires  these are renkels only known accomplices  whoa  oh im getting something  the second victim is in one of those pictures  what how do you know that  hes telling me he was murdered  hes saying it poorly cause he speaks with a whisthle  a whithle like thith he thpeakth like thith  which would be endearing on an eightyearold maybe terry thomas  or the original supermodel lauren hutton  but this this just screams for adult braces  any form of simple orthodontia really its not that expensive  youre saying its the guy who has the gap in his teeth  dont say gap  he prefers tooth alley but yeth it ith  i remember these guys  they all disappeared around the same time  we figured theyd just skipped town  thats it  the third victim is up there as well  hes not speaking because hes afraid youll criticize his appearance  just like you did with tooth gap boy  look now you got me doing it  someone mustve hunted them down and killed them ten years ago  and now theyre burning off the evidence  its a long time to wait to clean up a mess  you should see how long it takes gus to clean his cereal bowl  only one guy in the crew has been a suspect  in other arsons since the renkel fire  and thats bodie lambert  all right so why is bodie the only one were still hearing from  maybe he turned on his partners  happens all the time  this could be our killer  furder  what  fire murderer  furder  put a bolo on him asap  whoa whoa whoa  youre gonna issue these guys bolo ties  it stands for be on the lookout  what are you doing army will kill you if he sees you messing with this stuff  well why are we here  the cops are following the bodies  i thought wed take a different avenue  the buildings  what do we know  theyre all commercial and industrial  and  they were all built in the same year  after the renkel fire  correct  lotta open spaces no furniture cluttering up the joint  also  they seemed to be abandoned  yet none of them are for sale  why would three different owners  leave valuable real estate like that sitting around empty  what can i do for you guys  we need to see your files on the three burned buildings  sure just fill out requisition form ig88  you can get em upstairs  army that will take forever we really need to s  paperwork is paperwork its the basis for civilization  just fill out the forms ill give you everything you need  fire alarm  wed better evacuate  all right everybody outta here i gotta go deal with this  good thing we had a plan b ready  you smell like a peach meadow  thats the incense i used to set off the smoke detector  you didnt just pull the fire alarm its right there on the wall  uh thats a crime shawn i remain not culpable  i didnt set off the detector the smoke did  who burned the incense  i plead the fifth  element dimension beatle  you cant plead billy preston  all right whatre we doing  bring up the burnt buildings  okay  here we are  dude  all these buildings have sr next to em  that stands for seismic retrofit  it applies to any building built in 98  looks like all the safety codes were just changed last week  right before the first fire  thats why theyre all empty  theyre no longer considered earthquake safe  theyre gonna open up the walls to bring them up to code  dude thats it thats what started this whole thing  the killer realized that the bodies he stashed in those buildings  ten years ago are gonna be discovered and now hes torching the evidence  theres like 20 buildings scheduled to be retrofitted  lemme print out the list  well step it up  we still have a few minutes before they let anybody back in the building  dude trust me  you wanna hurry  you coulda pulled me outta there  dude i gave you two full warnings  my underwears soaked   just like old times  kiss my  guys  one of those buildings is gonna be targeted next by the arsonist  are you sure  im al b sure watching diane schuur apply sure rollon  while viewing the sure thing  thats pretty sure  its allday sure  you are a strange person but extremely effective  see a little teamwork isnt the worst thing  psychically i could sense  that there was information in that office that we need so uh  well go check with the cops while you scope those out  carpal tunnel  hey  thats fair  hey  we got a hit on that bolo  sheriff in barstow found bodie lambert  holed up in a motel 6 under one of his aliases  excellent  dobson  get a hold of barstow pd tell em not to make a move without us  he is mine  police  clear  ohara you got anything  nothing here all clear  do these things come in different sizes  because my movement is very constricted  i feel like its creating all the wrong lines  maybe if they were vnecks or lapels  or epaulets   whatre they doing here  i may have given them a headsup  it wasnt exactly an invitation  well he mustve bolted out the window hes not gonna get far  aerial two you got a twenty on the perp   you called in air support for this  of course i did  scuse me  if i may   whatre you doing  uh you might wanna stand back  freeze  put your hands behind your back  hes not talking  i sense that hes superstitious  he might talk to someone from a higher ethereal plane  may i have a shot  knock yourself out  gimme a second i have to go outside and get something off the ground  hey  shawn spencer  psychic interrogator  maybe you remember me from when i apprehended you  remember back then  no thats okay  i got everything i need  have fun in prison word to the wise  dont drop the bar of soap  oh please dont try that routine on me  no literally man dont drop the soap  theres so much bacteria on those floors  im pretty sure they only issue one bar a month so  why are you eating that  raw leaves is what the earth mother allows me to eat  it banishes all negative entities  what are you a fairy  hardly ive seen little darlings like 11 times  but i am a male wiccan  youre not wiccan  im level eight jack  id be level nine if it wasnt for my seasonal pollen allergies  whats your coven  say what  whats your passphrase  i dont know

pretty poed at you man  me  youre crazy i didnt do anything  she sent me here to stop you  how do you think i found you in that ceiling bro  luck no  i got a message  why is the earth spirit after me  she knows you lit those fires bro  we found the crewmates you murdered in the buildings  i didnt kill nobody brother  it mustve been that guy  whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait what guy  ten years ago  somebody started hunting us down  someone grabbed me outta my car  took me to some construction site  made me get on my knees  told me i had to pay for killing those two firemen  then he pulls the trigger  nothing happens  i get the hell outta there  i havent been to santa barbara since that night  i found wicca  and reformed  whered this mystery man take you bro  like an address or something  had a bag over my head most of the time  but that night is burned in my mind  i was about to die  and all i remember hearing is birds  lots of them  sounded like hundreds  birds  yeah chirping  wicca out brotha  shawn i still cant believe  the police thought  your birdchirping clue was too vague  well theyre still trying to figure out what building bodie was taken to  hey  well at least bodie told us the killers motives  someone is avenging the deaths of the firemen killed during the renkel fires  maybe it is a firefighter  i warned you shawn firefighters are trouble  i did everything in my power to keep you off the pole  and you succeeded dad in every conceivable way  but since our bad guy was targeting criminals  rogue cop is now added to the list  look we have all the potential arson targets  since our killer scouted one out for bodie  he may have still used them for other victims  and all you got going on is your bird chirping  wait a minute  what about mrs mugglesworth   my cockatoo when i was eight  yeah  wow i havent thought about her in years  remember when she died your parents fed you some story  about taking her somewhere  the bird sanctuary  but shes not dead shes still there  living amongst other relinquished avians  gus have you seen her since your parents took her there  of course not  she had a rare bird disease  where she would lose her feathers if anyone ever looked at her  so she has to be kept in a special mirrored cage  what  gus your parents lied to you  we do it sometimes to protect our kids  your bird bit the big one sorry pal  yeah not all pets can go live on a special wheat farm like my rabbits  thats right son  where is this bird sanctuary  third street and d   third and d  yeah  really  dude hundreds of birds chirping  that never occurred to you till now  leaving mrs mugglesworth was a painful memory shawn  i blocked it out until 12 seconds ago  guys guys guys the daedalus building  its right there right in that area  well when is it schedded to be retrofitted  tomorrow  well that means your pyromaniac is gonna get to work today  shawn we told morgan to check all these buildings  i gotta call her tell her not to go in without backup  dammit i still cant get a hold of morgan  i got a bad feeling about this  you call lassiter and the fire department  theyre on their way  morgan  army johnson  stay where you are  dont make a move  dude start talking  stall him till everybody gets here  dont let him toss that flame  i know you killed those criminals  but i know why  honey the last time this city had an arsonist  was so long ago i was still on the big red truck  because  back in the day you were a fireman  and those vandals set fires that took the lives of two of your colleagues  died fighting the renkel fires of 98  set by a bunch of vandals  i served sidebyside with those firemen for years  they had families  youre right they did  so you left the department  you took a job  inspecting buildings for code violations  and you discovered  those are pretty good places to hide a body  so you stalked and killed your victims  you covered them with lye  and then plugged them into walls  but your old buddy the fire chief figured you out  made a few calls  five calls in a row to hardware stores all over the city  affirmed that it was you that bought the accelerant  then finally  he caught you in the act  army what are you doing  dont do it dont do it  but it was too late wasnt it  always the fireman he tried to put it out  you even tried to save his life  come on danny  it wasnt my fault  danny wasnt supposed to be there  what about us  what about your arson inspector  we didnt do anything  do we deserve to die  i dont  i dont   no  no  but  but i cant live with this anymore  no  gus  get morgan get morgan  this is a mess wheres shawn  his cars over there  i can see somebody coming out  you guys okay  what the hell happened  what is army johnson doing here  army tr  he is the he is  hes the bad guy  really  well look at that  got you doing the grunt work huh  well all the new volunteers have to do it   hows it going so far  im pretty much a hero to the newbies  i mean ive already been in two fires  carried a man out stopped an arsonist  yes you have  well i just wanted to drop something by before i visit morgan in the hospital   whats that  meet  your new firedog  lady godiva  thats a boy shawn  oh yeah look at that  now ive already cleared it with the new fire chief  you just gotta walk him feed him clean up after him and whatnot  he needs eye drops at  and he may or may not have mange  youre not leaving that thing here im not taking care of him  gus if you dont take him cruella will turn him into earmuffs  goodbye lady g  shawn  shawn  did you paint these spots on
