rudimentary  levels of communication and somehow manage to feed yourselves  i see you for what you are children  so do me a favor and let the grownups do their work  i got a booboo  speaking of booboos you wouldnt happen to have  any extra unsolved cases lying around would you  spencer there is just no easy way to tell you  that i consider you a waste of this departments time and energy  i guess there was an easy way  but actually ive got less patience for you today than normal  see i received an invitation to give a presentation at 21les  enforcement seminar  yes  we know that better as 21 saint centles   i like to call it  go ahead make jokes  but we just did  you see kids i will be presenting the cutting edge technology  modern tools for the new detective  were talking

1974  wait a minute is is this a prank  did you take my car is this some sort of punking  to think that we would stoop so low as to tamper with policeissued property  and defile the institution that is the santa barbara police department  is an affront to our honor  i for one am greatly offended  and i for two  i just dont see how this could have happened  did you   wait im getting something  what shawn what is it  its a trace on lassies car its faint but clear  you were recently somewhere where the security of your car was compromised  im sensing someplace posh  surprisingly upscale for someone on half a civil servants salary  as it happens i dined at a very exclusive restaurant last night  the type of restaurant one would take a date to  is old lassie back in the game  it is non of your business with whom i spend my personal time  now you have to dish she blonde    brunette  mail order  you sly dog  please im not gonna engage in some sort of juvenile masculinity contest   he went by himself  yeah  her name was polly smith   we kissed ask her  polly smith  something happened at that restaurant that led to your car being stolen  im sensing red coats  and accents   the british  no the valets  check the valet departure car  he may have used the old key in the putty trick  to get an impression  of course that would have been my first deduction had i not been  overcoming this blatant violation  im gonna get right over there   no oh  no car remember  you guys are so funny oh guess what  i just got a new car yours  maybe we had a little too much fun with him  maybe  i have to peepee  may i help you gentleman  the theft of police property has occurred  i have reason to believe the guilty party works here  oh dear  well rest assured you have our complete cooperation  i only ask that you keep your investigation under wraps  you know for appearance sake  noted now im gonna need to sequester your main dinning room  interview your entire valet staff and possibly your busboys  one moment   yeah hes gonna be a problem  i dont know   he seemed pretty cooperative  your work here is done  ill get my car back soon enough here  but im warning you if word of this little incident  gets out of the station i will start making things very  difficult for you down there  youre saying you havent even been trying  all this time  goodbye  hes not gonna get anywhere talking to those valets  they have a very strict code  i still think youre thinking about the british  may have to roll my sleeves up for this one gus  actually i may have to take off my entire shirt  please dont  oh later  hi there my name is shawn spencer  im the head psychic for the santa barbara police department  and i may need to get a statement from you  more specifically the word yes   nice try  but i reserve the right to refuse service to anyone  thats all right  if my parents were visiting i probably wouldnt  wanna waste time meeting handsome new strangers either  regardless of how smart or interesting they might be  my parents are visiting that was pretty impressive  you really are psychic  sorry i thought you were just hitting on me  oh im actually much more interested in going out with your parents  i love the miniatures museum  what was it you need to ask me about  do you recall any uh  suspicious behavior from any of the valets on duty last night  now that you mention it we had a new guy who started yesterday   but didnt show up this morning  bingo  gonna need a name and a phone number  of course  and then  ill give you the information about the valet  get this the valets number is actually a number to a pay phone  outside of a warehouse yeah i dont know  i dont know if it looks like the warehouse from blue city gus  youre the only one that rembers that movie  what are you insane  way more people saw from the hipthan blue city  look im not gonna talk judd nelson right now  no just just meet me at the station in an hour thank you  a warehouse sweet  theres always something happening on the dl inside a warehouse  you staked it out right i know you staked it out  oh it got staked stook  staken   staked right  right  yeah yeah it got staked  you found out what happened to lassiters car  a whole bunch of cars go in but only boxes full  of car parts come out  dude its a chop shop  thats big  victims i see victims everywhere its horrible  sawedoff parts strewn about fluids spraying in every direction  oh dear god  are we talking about a serial killer  i can see the victims names accord look out  get outta there  escalade dont

mouse named algernon in a maze  flower street  flower street thats down by the tracks  we better check this out  you know you just bought that right  looks like a slam dunk mr spencer wally there is the ringleader  and all the evidence we need to take him down is right here  i mean stolen parts serial numbers shipment logs   you name it  no need to thank me chief  just glad to help dont thank him either  well if i cant thank you i cant pay you   our pleasure  oh youre very welcome you are  you know this ring was responsible for hundreds of car thefts around town  wally had operatives in places  mechanics valets car wash attendants  all copying peoples keys and then stealing their cars  from different locations  does it say anything in there about them stealing loose change  or switching the presets on radios  cause that happens to me all the time  okay gus  go ahead and put your aluminum foil hat back on  im not paranoid shawn it happens  anyway i believe this is a department record  for the fastest bust ever in a case this size  truly your most efficient work  oh stop thats so unnecessary  you know i couldnt help but notice that a certain vehicle belonging  to a certain head detective just happens to not be here  lassie we had the boys from crime scene  move your car up the street right before you and the chief arrived  youre in the clear tiger  thanks  although today is a street sweeping day  did we park on the east side or the west side of the street   north side  no no no it wasnt the north side  yes it was id know shawn  im good with directions youre not  gus you have the bearings of a wounded bumblebee  why would  we need to get out of here  well youre certainly a unique guy shawn  a guy who calls the day he gets the number   and brings flowers  i stole the flowers from table one  theyre fake and they smell vaguely of creamy pesto but im pretty sure  its the thought that counts  and youre good enough to come and meet me here my last  free night before my parents arrive  oh wrapping up this case was a lot easier than i thought  and this is one of the biggest strawberries ive ever seen  impressive  ive been here all day  so what do you say we take our dessert back to my place  i say yes  was this too easy  i beg your pardon  nothing im sorry never mind  i cant believe how quickly i nailed this   am i really this good  excuse me  i mean is it possible that no  no nothing like this has ever happened before  and nothings going to happen tonight either  how dare you think that im easy goodbye  what no no no no im not talking about you  this is this is something much worse  this is the first time ive been wrong about a case  gus im telling you it was too easy  why would this wally guy slip up by stealing  a detectives car from in front of a police station   that doesnt make any sense  sure it does  one of his guys got sloppy  gus im pretty sure i saw him smile as they loaded him  into the squad car  what he thinks going to prison is dope no come on  i think i solved the crime i was supposed to solve  not the crime i shouldve solved  okay youre not making any sense  and i happen to be busy so if you dont mind  what are you doing what is this what are you going somewhere  yes actually i am i finally have a free weekend  which means i get to use the spa utopia package i won  for being top sales rep  it comes complete with town car and driver  gus youve been bragging about that award for over a year why go now  maybe i kept pushing it back because i was always working a second job  like when i had to enter a civil war reenactment  or when i was protecting a sorority of pajamaclad coeds  youre actually complaing about that  no im not but lets not forget about the entire week i gave up  riding shotgun to a cat which by the way was not a boy cat at all  thats some serious stress shawn  i have to get a deeptissue massage to work out all the knots in my back  i call the big one little shawn   okay thats the creepiest thing anyones ever said to me  they have a blind masseuse up there named gloria  i hear she works wonders i cant wait  what is it with you and the blind  i remember you went crazy for that blind sculptor that did your bust  that was lionel richie in the video for hello  great now im gonna have that song stuck in my head  good goodbye shawn  chief we gotta reopen the chop shop case  im pretty sure we missed something  first of all we dont decide to reopen cases i do  thats what i meant   morning chief  morning  uh lassiter mr spencer seems to think we might have missed something  in the chop shop case  no no thats an openandshut case if ever ive seen one  sorry mr spencer but if you want to reopen the case youre gonna  need to come up with some concrete evidence  we dont devote department resources to personal whims  carlton i finished the powerpoint slides for your 21les presentation  this is official department business  oh youre right helvetica is  i know see how the m in double murder suicide  just jumps off the page  okay  is there anyone left that i can actually speak to about this case  like i said theres still quite a few unanswered questions  well what can i say you guys got me fair and square  thats just it what kind of chop shop artist steals a cops car  and doesnt chop it up  its almost like you wanted to leave a trail  leave a trail dont leave a trail wouldnt do any good  you guys caught me quick snap mind of a cheetah  i was like what cops are like wham miranda  yeah well theres still some questions  for instance why havent you posted bail wally  oh its all good you know iam just do my time with good behavior  and go on with my life till then im likemy bad  the courts like get in that cell  justice  okay lets try this again  prisoner 1906

here  sorry shawn what are you doing here  trust me the way todays going i need to relax too  i cant get the chief to reopen the case  i already  i already told you im not helping you either   you will when you hear this  what  i visited wally  in prison   you went to the pen  i went to the joint  you went to the clink  according to the visitors log the only other person who  dropped by to see wally was jonny g  who turns out to be the jonny g of jonny gs  bling it on custom auto shop   so all hes guilty of is a bad pun  hardly  first wally gets arrested for running a chop shop  then he gets visited by jonny g who works in custom auto parts  adds a whole new angle to the case gus  look is jonny g dirty too whats the g stand for  is wally working for him  what other criminal nonsense are they up to  man we may have just uncovered the tip of the iceberg here   thats all youve got  that and this  it burns  sitting here listening  to you right now little shaw just got bigger  i beg your pardon   no thanks  fine  what time are you seeing that blind chick  gloria cant see me  dude i know how being blind works  i mean shes booked shawn  i had to book with this girl named kelly  i

new nanomaterial vest we ordered for 21les  yes its gonna kill  the kevtek 7000 is made with nanomaterial polymers  that give it enough strength to stop a tank mortar shell   i cant wait to try it out  oh no no no last time you got to be incapacitated by the sonic gun  now its my turn   let go ohara  oh come on  drop it   just let me try it  you know ive had just about enough  of the two of you  you can both be shot just sign the waivers  sonny  was a cuckoo bird  clearly he was cuckoo for something   cocoa puffs  exactly   i always thought it was cuckoo puffs  no  sonny is cuckoo for the puffs which are coco  thats why the milk turns all brown and chocolatey  i was never allowed to eat that stuff when i was a kid  thats why i dont have any cavities   so are we having cereal  yes  but im getting more  9459687     are these serial numbers  yes but theres more  i see shiny rims  spoilers hammered rims  spencer is this about the chop shop   cause we told you the case is closed  now hold on  this is very specific information  ohara run the numbers by the crime lab  just to make sure we didnt miss anything in the sweep  and you better not be wasting department time mr spencer  because if you are well be using these new vests on you   thats a great idea  thank you  because that way its a plus for me whether they work or fail  it better not take long for juliet to run those numbers  it wont  i already missed all of yesterday on this alreadysolved case  this is my last day to enjoy my vacation  you dont realize how much stress ive been on these past few  im not playing shawn i never get to do anything for myself  im getting that massage  and yes ill be naked and unashamed under my robe  while they rub little shawn down  wait it wasnt like that  jules what do you got on those serial numbers  well the good news is they tracked them to car parts  the bad news is the parts were purchased legitimately for bling it on  and the even worse news  is that lassiter wants to know what size vest you wear  very funny  thanks for making my life more challenging   the car parts at the shop were legit  looks that way  there must be something else going on down there that were missing  besides selling stolen car parts  we gotta get back down there and look for clues  i dont know about you but im still on vacation  looks like somethings wrong with your indash  dvd navigation and integrated surround sound system  that was my speedometer  now i cant see how fast im going  regardless weve gotta take it back to jonny g to fix  hey dude is jonny g around  uh dont know weve been busy   what you working on there  getting this fleet ready  to ship to arizona  okay thanks  and stealth mode   what are we looking for anyway  anything that points  to criminal activity  you know a white cloth sack with a green dollar sign  a red barrel labeled tnt  an anvil anything   check this out  what you already have something  the point of those examples was to imply it wouldnt be so obvious  look how light it is  awesome flavor flav can wear it around his neck  flav wears clocks not rims shawn  why dont you put your phone on vibrate  dad this is not a good  okay relax  i will be right there   we gotta go  go  we either need to be working on this case  or i need to be back on my vacation  he said he needed me there immediately  ive never heard him sound this urgent i hope everythings okay  here scale   this was the urgent emergency  yeah  gotta get these on the grill before its too late  i cant believe you had me rush down here for this dad  i thought something was actually wrong with you   whats wrong with you  you remember how to scale   dont you shawn  yes i remember how to scale  you only made me do it  a kid who didnt believe in animal cruelty by the way  those animals wouldve killed you dead given the means  all right you scrape the scales  you dont bruise the flesh you make an incision around the gill   and you fillet  down the spine  very good you do remember  and gus you remember  where the bathroom is  youre taking me away from very important work right now  ill have you know im on the verge of uncovering something big really big  huge  did you ever have a case you couldnt crack  yeah yeah sure of course more than a few  but a good detective learns the most when he doesnt get the bad guy   no i got the bad guy  oh well sometimes he gets off  but a good detective doesnt let that get him down  no hes still in jail  matter of fact chief vick even says its my best work  all right then whats the problem  it doesnt feel like my best work you know  it feels too easy  did you ever have that problem  no shawn i dont recall any champagne problems like things being  too easy  i dont know i guess  i just imagined my best work would be more complicated you know  more  intricate important and  just more you know more  as always you go after something for the flash for the excitment  and when you finally get it youre never satisfied   it always needs something more  that is categorically untrue  your best case what does it need it needs more excitement  your first bike what did it need more reflectors  well shawn did you ever stop and think that maybe its your expectations  that need to change  son look at me look shawn  sometimes a case  is just a case  hes just a trainee for k9 unit  wait a second  wait a second i just figured it out  wait wait dont shawn dont do this  oh this is much bigger than we thought   and i was right all along  shawn dont you dare  dont you dare learn a wrong lesson while im trying to teach you a right lesson  look how light it is  getting this fleet ready to ship to arizona  stop it stop stop stop trying to figure it out   stop jumping  i cant help it  it all makes sense gus we gotta go   ill explain on the way  shawn shawn  you should be happy with a job well done  regardless of the excitement that it produces  is that it  yeah thats it  is it a tight knot right under the shoulder blade  yeah howd you know  gus  jonny g is smuggling drugs out of state inside a car parts  thats why those rims at the office were so light dude  they were hollow  and thats how he gets the drugs out  and some of that residue mustve gotten on your car  which is why that police dog went crazy barking at the wheels  thats what wallys been covering for all along  hes just a fall guy jonny gs running the real operation  drug trafficking  we need to make it back to that shop before the evidence leaves for arizona  lets go   damn it were too late  somebodys here  jonny g  dude  his foot is still on the accelerator  stop this isnt funny  you stop  i cant  the nitrous oxide canisters open  laughing gas that stuff is deadly in high doses  at least we know what the cause of death is  i cant believe jonny g went out like that  the police suspect foul play  but so far they have no leads  all while i was on lockdown  guess i ended up with a better sentence than jonny g did  irony  we still have a few questions  what do you know about a shipment of custom cars on its way to  arizona  we were partners but  jonny g was involved in a lot of stuff i didnt know about  if i asked questions hed be like nunya  id be like okay relegate  so so youre saying  you werent involved with the custom car shop at all  im saying i was just a front man for the chop shop  and now im doing my time  but when i get out  crimes gonna be like come out and play wally come on  im be like no  wally doesnt live here anymore  reassimilated  times up  dude  im starting to think i was wrong about wally  when the first time or the second time  both  i think hes the mastermind behind this whole drug thing and jonny gs murder  but wally was in jail when jonny g died  yeah  he made sure of that   this is a little awkward  man lets get outta here  wally made it easy for us to catch him because he wanted to get thrown in jail  that way hed be locked up when he murdered jonny g  which would give him the perfect alibi  with jonny g out of the way  wally assumes sole control of the custom car shop   and the secret drug operation  hello motive my old friend  get this  according to public court records wally posted bail this morning  why wait until now  dude  because the big drug deal goes down today  but we dont know when or where  oh yes we do  yes we do  you call fleet feat trucking  find out if theyre making any custom car deliveries today  find out when and where ill go get jules and lassie  dude we got this  as you will see the tools in the arsenal of the modernday detective  are formidable  to say the least  lights please enjoy  i pretended to be jonny gs lawyer  got the trucking company to tell me that a fleet from bling it on  is expected to be dropped off at 230  i wrote the location down  this says in the middle of a field    why did you have to write that down  the address is on the back  nice  we dont we dont have a lot of time  lights please  scientific advancements  in the mapping of the human genome  in the manipulation of the building blocks of matter itself  have taken law enforcement into the 21st century and beyond  thank you  thanks very much  so are there any questions  yes  i thought you were gonna show us some new law enforcement techniques  weve seen all these things on csi  well i can assure you that  this technology represents the latest available to police departments  oh now youre onto something lassie  spencer  nobody called for a psychic   psychic awesome  im getting a reading here  its strange   gus what is this  i think you may be magnetized  right in the middle of my presentation  wait is he police sanctioned  yes  yes he is  because we at the santa barbara police department believe in using  every tool in our arsenal to combat crime  and mr spencer here is often under my jurisdiction  wait im getting a location  its an abandoned railroad track but why  please tell me spirits of cuttingedge law enforcement technology  im getting michael douglas  catherine zetajones  the always underappreciated don cheadle   you know thats right  traffic  say hello to my little friend  uhscarface  theyre all movies about drugs  yes drugs  there must be a giant drug deal going down there   right now  we can send a squad car over   to check it out  fine  theres no time its happening in ten minutes   we have to go now  we cant get there in ten minutes  i can lets roll   can we come  yes of course you can come  you wait out front and well pull around for you  its been a pleasure doing business with you  thank you  get up against the car  turn around up against the car  look we were just having a business transaction  i was like here are your automotive parts good sir  and hes like please take my money   capitalism  come on  oh wally  selling custom car parts is legal  killing jonny g to take over his drug operation  not legal  im laughing ha ha ha ha  entertained  well we try  makes perfect sense though  knowing how much you resented jonny g  for not including you in the real business down at the shop huh  jonny g was involved in a lot of stuff i didnt know about  if i asked questions hed be like nunya id be like okay relegated  you figured out a way to take him out  and take over his entire enterprise  you got yourself arrested because you knew that in jail youd have the perfect alibi  when jonny g showed up dead  who would dare steal my car  brilliantly planned this murder beforehand  knowing that jonny g is a creature of habit  i always do the final checks myself just to make sure it meets the specs  you know what i mean you know what i mean  that he personally inspects  every single car on the day that its supposed to be delivered  and that he is very very thorough  so you figured out which canister of nitrous oxide hed be using  and rigged it so it would leak  when the gauge redlined  very creative  but unlike last time theres no evidence  the peoples burden  im sorry jules what was that  oh i didnt say anything   you didnt say anything  no  well whos the chatty cathy with  back there in  nothing  well whos  whos talking  some  somebody that saw everything go down  wha who  who is that  its
