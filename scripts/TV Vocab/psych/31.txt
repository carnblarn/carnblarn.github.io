                hon im gonna grab a drink   wanna get me one too sweetie  okay  shawn  what are you doing  you were supposed to be asleep two hours ago  i was watching  and then i know i shouldnt but then  i didnt want to go back upstairs  i was scared  all right  now listen now you know that none of this  people do not become bloodthirsty monsters after they get shot  in fact ive had a lot of experience in the field  with puncture wounds and theres no way a giant dart to the lungs creates  a 6inch hole visible from the other side   really  no way  i mean maybe the bloodengorged cavity will become purple and expand  and perhaps even explode ive seen that  look dead bodies do not walk son  sometimes they suddenly blink or jolt for a second but  mostly they just wither and smell  and drizzle and ooze  all right now go to bed  sleep tight  a museum  and not even the one downtown   hey the paper come out yet  i dont know they running another   story on the wyles death  i dont know perhaps  gosh i hadnt even thought about that  carlton youre names been in every article theyve printed since youve reopened the case  has it i try not to read the papers too much very skewed  no i was just gonna look at the classified ads i mean you know ive been looking   for a new bobs big boy right  i got it detective  press operator from the mirror gave me an advanced copy  but theres nothing about you or wyles in there  what impossible i leaked that stuff about the will getting changed yesterday  hey did you say you were looking for a big boy like a fullsize  go away  things a rag anyway   security tape ms bridgewell  hi im detective ohara   sophie  wait youre the curator   assistant curator  id like to speak to someone in charge   i am in charge  she sounds in charge   the mummy rooms this way please follow me  wheres the curator  hes in egypt procuring the rest of this collection but i assure you  theres no need hes been working all night can you catch us up  this exhibit just opened yesterday i dont know how this is possible  it was a prank or some sort of dare  its a 3000yearold mummy thats missing officer  its detective and its not like it was covered in gold  i mean he wasnt a king or a prince or even a royal food taster  he was just some guy who happened to die got himself wrapped up and was found in a pretty  cracked box he probably mummified himself  he hasnt had his coffee yet has anyone found the night watchman   im afraid not  night watchman douglas f hastings  burglary on his record   technically burglary is a felony  two charges dropped  dont you people run background checks  doug was a very good employee whos been here seven years  and we have a complex security system  which was due to be overhauled last spring  we pushed it back we have a very abulic board of directors  good id like to speak with each one of them as soon as the sun rises  now if youll forgive us we have several highprofile cases that dont involve  archaic security systems in rundown buildings  ohara put out an apb on the guards vehicle  look up the word abulic and meet us back at the station  just a minute i dont know who you are detective  but this was no prank  the alarm was triggered from the inside  and although our archaic security footage  was limited to rotating shots of the four main rooms  not a single image shows the culprit  or the mummy being carried from the building  shes right its all right here  the mummy disappeared in 15 seconds or less and our main feed picked up none of it  this all cracks of something larger than petty crime  and not to sound too shirley mcclain screams of something potentially  supernatural  this requires someone with skills beyond the normal person  i want him   no you dont  yes i do  do you think hes up  hello  jules  actually im wide awake why do you ask  you want to watch a movie together over the phone  please say its father of the bride two  how about captain ron  pure luck  you dont have anything with martin short  hold on a second  well you dont have to get snippy  youre the one that drunkdialed me  really  i just assumed i mean its 425 right  the museum   are you kidding  they love me down there  you see my plaque   whats wrong  they only put one name on there   so  so gus is gonna have an aneurysm  and not the good kind  spencer we can rehash good times later right now i really need you to create  some semblance of focus  missing mummy missing guard old security system  please tell our feisty little assistant curator that this was not some elaborate breakin  so we can all go home  okay ill try  that a real beaver   shawn spencer  i know   sophie morris bridgewell  i know   everyone certainly loves you down here  and i love you  metaphorically what  you had your shot  let me do what i do  excuse me ill need some space  thank you  have it   have it  want it   have it  mines bigger   i have a problem  what is it  the layout of this display is horrible  who designed this  its ridiculous really  we need two of these   queen nurfurtittie  nefertiti  ive heard it both ways  well  im gonna have to concur with detective carlito lassiteros on this one  that mummy was not stolen ms bridgewell   great  im afraid it walked out  all on its own  the mummy walked out come on youre just trying to impress   that pretty little assistant curator  was she pretty i hadnt noticed  really brown eyes languid smile long slender neck of a balanchine dancer  i had three different hairstyles last week and you didnt comment on one  look i felt that something got up out of that coffin and walked away  not to the exit  but to the body of the museum  good youre here  all of you in my office  sweet now you got us in trouble  what i have to say is very difficult  if this in any way pertains to lassiters third testicle im afraid we already know  this is no time for jokes mr spencer  when i accepted this position on an interim basis  the agreement between myself and the mayor was should things work out  at an appropriate time the interim would be removed from the title  as you know that has not yet happened and recently i gave the mayor a deadline  a deadline that has passed without any sort of response  so effective friday im stepping down as chief   what  im leaving  you cant do that do they know  oh they know  ill write a letter ill start a petition  ill leak it to the reporter at the mirror  ohara please thank you  i appreciate the sentiment but the die is cast  chief  are you sure you dont want to wait it out just a little bit longer   you never  no mr spencer   so youre saying the job is open  what  i mean did anyone mention my name  i believe they have someone in mind  but you dont know if its me  look chief let me just offer that i think youre a great chief  and uh im sure things will all work out  thats all for now  go  what are you watching  security videos from the museum  videos as in actual video tapes  well their system could use an overhaul  where are the tapes from the other cameras  thats it   one tape  yeah its on a rotation  its actually not a bad system you know  it appears you cant leave the museum without getting caught by the cameras  so its efficient  maybe  we should probably check it out for ourselves though   what say you  sure  theres one thing you should probably know before we get there  paleosleuth shawn spencer   i know  i dug that thing up too  gus believe me i was appalled myself at first sickened really  but then i noticed look the didnt forget you completely   where  there right there the photo by section  that says photo by bruton gaster  well i gave em the info when i was driving through a tunnel so that probably played a role  i want a new plaque shawn i want it tomorrow  i want my name in big yellow letters that blink  and why wont you even tell me what this museum case is about  in time in time  gentlemen thank you for coming  mr spencer very good to see you again and you must be mr gastor  guster burton guster you people ever hear of spell checker  i was just giving gasty here all the specifics  yes well the exhibit just opened yesterday afternoon without a hitch   the alarm went off at 300 am  i was here at 500   am  you were not   i was i was working  doing what  it was a private case look i dont think we should bore ms bridgewell here  with the complexities of our other investigations  youre not tailing cheating boyfriends again are you   gus come on im trying to look cool  i told you before shawn  we are bigger than that we cleared like 50 bucks on the last one  gus psychicclient privilege and what not come on   shall we continue  yes this way   whats wrong with you  you stole my picture  so the bulk of the activity seems to have occurred in here  yes i can see it  the lid sliding off the being rising up  walking across the floor not unlike an egyptian  gus could show you   gus  nope   no what  you know im not walking into that room shawn  come on dude i thought this was over in the sixth grade  whats wrong  he wont break the plane of the mummy room  why not  hes afraid of being cursed   hes not that far off base really  please dont coddle him  every one of those guys that unearthed tuts tomb cursed   theyre all dead now  of course they are  that was over 80 years ago come on man  this is gonna be good for you walk to me face your fears  you can talk all you want but facts and logic will win out this time  facts and logic are in the corner of the guy who thinks hes gonna get his face melted off  im not hearing it shawn  well you wanted to check the cameras right  will you set foot in the security camera room  this systems actually better than i thought  even if you make it out of one room you get picked up in the next room immediately   yeah  im gonna try and beat the system  watch me just on the center screen see if i can get out   all i gotta do is sit here fine  yeah well communicate on the phone   so give me a call  no you call me this is my work cell   im not paying for that call  gus its usage minutes  it doesnt matter which one of us makes the call  just call me shawn  fine  im sorry i cant let this go its a monthly plan its a minutes plan  can we get started with this thing now  i saw that got it on two angles  do you want to give this up any time soon  youre crawling  i see you shawn youre behind the plant  see you there see you there  the plant is moving across the room shawn  leave that poor lady alone shawn  youre using the carpet  really wait a minute i almost bought that for a second  youre using the wolf pelt  this is like watching entrapment if instead of catherine zetajones   they had some guy with pancake butt  i do not have pancake butt   what you got you got something  yep  really you can see me right now   horrid shawny boy  horrid  great now i gotta watch this  youre muting me  for the first interesting thing thats happened  look at me look at me i love my hair  i can make obscure 80s references that nobody understands  laugh at me  hey know something about me  i have a motorcycle but i never seem to be riding it   how about this are you seeing this  yep   how about now you see this  terrible   how about this you seeing this  if youre gonna hide under a barrel  dont put the phone next to your ear  youre getting all of this you can see all of this  yep  whoa i lost you  there you are  ha i got you  for one second shawn  trying that corner again please  shawn  eh great  now you wore down my battery  where are you  how about now  bingo  im sure you can understand mr wyles why ive been so motivated  by what ive uncovered in this investigation  well all i know detective is i certainly seem to see your name in the paper every day  really  which paper would that be because you know ive missed some of the coverage   can we just get on with what you want  of course its really  just more of a formality than anything i wasnt even going to call you in today  i just need to go over a few bank records and see some papers   and exhume your fathers body  im sorry what was that last one  oh uh its just more of a technical detail than anything exhuming your fathers body  i mean you wouldnt even have to be there i could have him back in eternal slumber by noon    this place is gonna close soon  no its not  shawn i was in there forever somebodys shutting off the lights with us in here  pretty sure thats a timer  why would they set a timer with people still in here  cause the museum closed 20 minutes ago  how did they close it with us inside  well remember i said i talked to sophie the curator shes very sweet by the way  she loves red robin isnt that a strange favorite restaurant  youre going behind the tarp really  theres an exit behind the tarp  youre probably gonna be eaten by carpet beetles  look i discovered a number of intriguing things when i was figuring out how to crack  the security cameras including an exhibit that looked like it had already been  broken into so what im thinking is  whoever did it might come back because anyone on the inside  knows that theres no night guard on duty and  and what   sophie said it was cool  what was cool  come on man havent you ever wanted to spend a night in the museum you know do it up with all  the stuffed creatures and the bones  no shawn i havent i cant spend the night in the museum  i dont have my tooth brush i dont have any of my multivitamins  and oh yeah i dont want my soul suffering eternal damnation  for disrupting the sleep of an egyptian canal digger  come on dude  with hastings on the lam theyre fresh out of night watchmen  sophie was actually quite happy that i offered shes taking me to dinner  what do they have at red robin  come on gus they didnt get what they were looking for the first time maybe theyll break in again  well be here to catch em redhanded wont that be cool  dude theres probably a sensor of some sort take a step back  okay now try it   whats on the hill  thats freedom shawn   does that look like a camera  no no ones gonna leave their camera   outside in the mist so it can get ruined  looks like a camera to me   we caught a break  we caught a break  hastings that security guard from the museum whos still missing had a few assault charges  on his record that never went to trial  hastings is way more violent than we thought   and we found the car finally  they found his car   yeah it was in the shop actually  but you didnt find him  no the shop gave him a loaner i just thought i would let you know  give you a heads up see if you come up with anything   what kind of car is the loaner  gray gmc pickup   dont be mad  why would i be mad  im locked in a museum with possibly a violent criminal  and probably an angry mummy spirit  and heres a bonus we have no phones   i told you to charge that phone  you did not  i didnt  does thinking it count  they might have a snack bar  you know maybe that truck wasnt gray dude  maybe it was like a deep midnight blue  or a black or a nicekelly green its hard to know for sure  you know the cones in the eyes make it possibleto see at night  i know how the eyes work shawn i just hope i still have minein the morning  where exactly are we hes here  hes gonna come back hes gonna kill us  dude i never said hastingsstole the thing  no you think the actual mummy walked out  that makes me feel better  dont go allglass half empty on me let me show you what i found  what is wrong with this flag  everything   besides that  i dont know   its upsidedown  and backwards whats your point  its dust gathered on the bottom of the frame  that means somebody eitherturned it upsidedown or knocked it over  whoa  i lost you for a second there you are  and this little nook is not in camera range  its not a nook  what would you call it its clearly nota corner  cranny will you sign off on cranny   why am i here shawn  because  somebody didnt want the camera to see what ever happened in this cranny  i never signed off on cranny theres nothing here gus  its just a bunch of old guns  and not even nice onesat that  the lexan glass case that houses it is worth more   lexan glass  yeah its bullet proof  well it would have to be in case the guns decided to fire them selves  lexan glass  what  thats common know ledge shawn people know that  who people in charlton hestons house  yes and your mama  did you hear that  nobodys here but us  i tried shawn i cant do this  gus dont bea traveling wilbury   look christines here  will you stop it shawn  relax its not eventhe right color  dude  we have got to get one of these for the office  how much you think these things run   i dont know  how heavy are they  that was actually kind of scary gus  come on dude its just the motoron the fridge  of course why wouldan exhibit be plugged in  the sign says do not touch shawn  not anymore   its stuck though  its supposed to be stuck  to keep people like you out  people who what  people who spend the night in museums to investigate mummies  that may have walked out on their own  you are here  what are you doing  bidding for talismans  talismen  i dont care what theyre called shawn  im acquiring protection for the spiritual injustice we caused in the museum   you can buy wolfsbane online  in bulk  now i just gotta find somebody to loan me a cat   you got mcnabbs number  come on gus  i thought that at the very least finding the guard dead would  help you jump on the band wagon that hey this is a realflesh and blood killer  he was killed by the mummy shawn  you dont know that you have no proof  okay fine im sorry im sorry that i didnt tell you i signed us up for night guard duty  and im sorry i didnt tell you there was a mummy involved  but we have a legitimate trail now the copsare taking this seriously  i need you i need the sweet blue shirt i need the pants  i need the winsome smile that hides the sad jamaican clown inside  we need to call lassiter and we are not going back to the museum  no more mummy room no more spooky stuff  i promise  hes exhuming a body  he is casually disturbing what should be the passing of a great and dignified man  yeahhe does that  white socks black shoes  whats the rule on that dont you have to be wearing jeans whats the rule  come on dude i honestly had no idea he was gonna be pulling a corpse from the ground  dont worry about it shawn  i honestly didnt know i was gonna be putting my foot in your ass  lifes full of surprises  i got the coroners reporton the guard hastings  at least stay for this see how silly it is to be afraid of mummies  what do you got jules   youre not gonna like it  were not gonna like it   im sure well be able to make something of it  hastings was strangled to death  no magic involved there and correct me if im wrong jules  but you can actually get fingerprints off strangulation victims   im afraid thats not possible  why is that  the hand was wrappedin some sort of cloth  cloth  there were linen fibers embedded into the guards neck  clearly that was just to cover his prints  we also found dust and spores that werent from this area  well maybe the cleaning crew didnt come around  only if they didnt come aroundfor over 3000 years  the spores camefrom inside the coffin  thanks jules  finally  finally what   ive been leaving message son your phone  yeah i sor tof dropped my phone  yeah whatd i tell youa bout taking care of your stuff  you know what youre right first my tricycle out in the yard now this   i see a pattern developing here  all right look shawn  i was hoping we could talk alone  no offense gus   di  no no dont you dare  we are here to talk to you and this is urgent   so is mine  ours involves a dead guy   why do you always have to win shawn  cause were winners  fine what is it go ahead  okay  what do you do when your best suspect  sort of just   say it shawn  doesnt exist  anymore  people disappear all the time shawn some are very good at it  especially a career criminal  yeah this is a little more complicated  look it doesnt matter who youre talking about here shawn  but when the trail goes cold you do what every good cop does  you follow the time line you trace back the steps that led to the trail going cold   back ground check  exactly  perfect perfect dad  but i wanna see you later without gus  i need to talk to you  okay what is this  what is all this without gus stuff i mean its gus just say it   say what it is what is it  okay all right  i got a phone calla couple of days ago and  i dont know if you have any plans but  are you busy on

detective lassiter and i just ant to throw you a going away party  its going to be very  william wyles the beud  it was formerly believed that wyles death was due  to an accidental fall down the stairs of his montecito home  but now a former employee has come forward to say  she heard loud arguing coming from the wyless study the night of his death  contrary to the belief that wyles was alone the night he died  santa barbara police detective carlton lassiter  whos been leading this investigation was unavailable for comment  unavailable for comment ive been here all day  whos not giving memy messages  cupcakes  right of course  with little cuffs on them  and sprinkles  were really gonna miss you  wyles who became a publishing magnate at the age of 30  was one of santa barbaras leading philanthropists  and a major contributor to political campaigns  as well as a wellknown collector of war memorabilia  at his height he owned more than 30   hows the back ground check coming  just finished  rahm entottem lived during the  probably near giza  he had 11 sons all of whom spent their days smelting metal  from the orealong the banks of the nile  smelters  perhaps you misunderstood  we dont care what he did when he was living  only since hes been a mummy  lets do this  first he was on display for six months in cincinnati  he didnt kill anybody there  then he was on loan plano texas  nobody had their eyes or internal organs stolen there   whats that  its a bowl of chili   and whos that up there  its austin kerns would you pay attention  then he was transported for two days by truck  spent the evening in the museum ware house  and boomwas on display first thing the next morning  mines better  yeah but mines something sensible that people might utilize  so yourethe sensible one now   more and more lately  okay  all right lets work back wards  we just did  this is as close as i get to that museum  i know quick put that on  my name is shawn spencer im working with sophie and the museum  this is my partner paddy simcox  were wondering if theres any documentation on the arrival of the rock em sock em mummy  rahmentottem  or has there been any instances of things exploding for no apparent reason  i dont know nothing   and i dont think you guys should be in here  right  perhaps ill call sophie and let her know youre not being very help ful  listen all i have security access for is this room  well then let us know what happens here man here at the docks  fine its simple  that thing shows up a museum rep comes and does an inspection  and then we put itout on the floor  i wish that there was more that i could tell you  dude its a tripod  i told you that was a tripod  with a camera coming back  hey wait up  what are you doing  left your

 arent you guys with the  yes we are   with who  who ever you think were with   the museum  yes exactly and you are a film student  yes working on night cycle  its my thes is project  its just the life cycle of a wild flower at the top of the hill   the name of your film is night cycle  whats wrong with that  well its kind of boring  unless its about a motorcycle that comes to life at night and  solves crime and does sweet whee lies  listen  i alread y told the guy in the jumpsuit i mean you could barelysee the museum in the background   i just needed to frameit up that way  you have foot age of the museum  yeah but it wont infringe on anyones copyright i can guarantee it  do you have stuff from tuesday night  yeah but not on me  here it is  a standard video camera runs at 30 frames per second   yeah we know that  how would we know that  its common know ledge shawn and technically its 2997  unless youre working in hd then its 2398 partially segmented frames  regard less for time lapse i set it for one frames for minute  so everything moves faster   30 times faster  1800 times faster   i knew that i was testing you  sure you did  okay guys what are we looking for here exactly  its pretty simple  a crime occurre dat the museum on this particular evening  we just wanna know if your camera caught any foot age of it its nothing too crazy  and most likely theres a crazed mummy out and about strangling people willynilly  yes and that  this is 300 am  slow it down here  this is kind of exciting  holy crap gus can you believe it  gus  hes a little scared of mummies  dude its just a film   video  even better  no one can reach through the screen and grab you  thats so weird  we only saw him for one frame and then  you know he walked out and poof  hes gone  wait  the lights on the van  dude he took that van  the mummy  great  now we got a mummy on the loose and the son of a bitch know show to drive a stick   now we know how he got away  we need to call the police  no not

dude shes not even gonna be in california by the time we get out of here  just keep turning the wheel   i dont wanna hit anything shawn  this is a company car  dude you got it you clearly had itafter the se  really  the 11point turn dude  this is a prime example of a situation best handled by the police   or a witch doctor  its not a mummy gus  you keep saying that and it keeps coming up mummy  no way he makes that turn  slow down  he hit a tree   lets go get him  im not getting out there  dude they hit a tree  who ever they are theyre not moving theyre incapacitated  they could be hurt maybe even dead  maybe undead   they might need our help  or our internal organs   lets call the police  with whose phone  all right fine  im bringing my bat  grab some flash lights  shawn i think  i think this may be the most terrifying moment of my life  youre confronting ithead on  im so proud of you buddy  i think i just saw someone running away in the woods  look  that doors cracked  i dont think anybodys here  how sure are you  fairly to pretty damn  good because i dont think i can take one more  shawn  i am telling you carly town you gotta come with uson this  and im telling you im about to solve the biggest case of my career  so which do you think id rather do  the old man didnt die from a fall down the stairs  initial findings indicate he had blunt force trauma to his head before he fell  so unless youve gota psychic answer for that you guys can run along  crud now wyles isnt answering his phone  i have the final coroners report on that exhumed body  it was definitely a head trauma  and it turns out that unidentified matter found in his skull was a chip of ivory  great  but i have the best reveal ever  spencer well get to your little mummy thing later  quite honestly i only took the case because wyles iv is on the board of trustees  i thought i could do a little snooping but all i got was dead ends  i can solve both cases   you can what  lassie call wyles on his cell phone  hell pick that up because hes not at home dude we got it   oh we are good  then meet us at the museum  why cant they just meet usat a welllit starbucks  one more time buddy for justice   why am i here  youll find out soon enough  but whatever it is im taking full credit for it  just cooperate with us mrwyles  things dont look very good for you right now   yeah well ill have your job  well its too late for that  someone else already does  shawn  dont worry sophie im being very gentle  i laid down a blanke tand everything  not my first time alone in a coffin  by the way  playing dead awesome   what is this nonsense  hes solving a case  actually im solving two cases but lets take the mone at a time  first a being did rise from this coffin  and walk out of the museum on tuesday night  strangled poor hastings may he rest in peace with his bare hands  correction   linenwrapped hands  thank you  i was the first one to say that it was a mummy  but that being was not the mummy   rubmybottom  rahmentottem  that mummy never made it into the museum  no that mummy never made it out of the white van in the parking lot  it was swapped out by an angry ware house foreman on wheels  it was all part of an elaborate breakin  this is absolute insanity  an interesting choice of words i thought for sure youd say genius   well why would i say genius  because it was your plan  my plan  youre the one that got into the snuffalupagus wrapped in  just enoughte astained linen to look like a mummy through the cracked lid  you needed to get those pistols back didnt you  yeah the ones that used to be at the top of the stairs in your fathers house  especially that one with the chipped ivory handle   which  which was the murder weapon  come on lass a little consideration please i mean look  im going all out with the cloth and thing here im doing my thing   detectives  you knocked your father  on the head with that pistol let him fall to his death  and then ran out and waited for somebody else to find him  and the pistol got willed to the museum  thats why you worked so hard to get that exhibit closed  and delayed the installation of the new security system  he couldnt get his way into the display but he needed to be in the museum  you have been a busy little boy havent you  i believe you will be my final santa barbara arrest  mrwyles  put your hands behind your back sir  nice nice but guys check it out theres more right  he tilted the camera so that he wouldnt be visible  he he strangled hastings so there wouldnt be a witness  i saw him run away in the forest  gus  is there any chance at all youll stay  no  but im sure well see each other around  look i knew the mayor wante draymond sauter for the job hes an old friend of his  but sauter didnt become available until recently  so i did what i had to do  look im sure sauter will do a fine job  are you sure youll have a use for this  dude youre being kind of insensitive  shell be fine  phone its the mayor  yes sir  well yes but  of course yes thats  sir you dont have to beg  you are begging  as of now  okay   im the new chief  not interim  dont you dare call me that again  oh my god what happened what did he say   i honestly have no idea  i think i do  whats this  bumped my arrest to page two  congratulations karen  thank you  photo bruton gaster   we should have a party  we should definitely have a party   we have all the party accoutrements  just go get some party gear  and just open some crackers and a bottle of something  shawn are you sure you didnt get some sort of special message this week  dad i told you i dropped my phone now i gotta go  no no shawn look theres something i gotta get off my chest before you leave here  dad i dont know if you just read the secret or watched an emotional oprah or what  but i dont think were ready to open our souls to each other   well we have no choice kid  but we do and its good  because what we have is simple and shallow and unobtrusive  so lets have this conversation when youre 90 and maybe on an oxygen tank  cause i have a date with a woman who runs a museum   and thats new for me  no shawn   please no  it just feels good  you know what ill grab the door for you on my way out  mom
