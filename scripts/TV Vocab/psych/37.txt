even know what for  what is that the fungus one  dont play you know that fungus is my bread and butter  really  you know what my bread and butter is bread and butter  fungus has never entered into the equation not once  all the chief said was that time was of the essence   and that shed brief us on the boat  i wonder what this case is about   it has something to do with the ocean  it could be anything  crab on crab violence a gang war between the mermen and the shark people  or maybe she wants to take us wild orca hunting  all right guys come on up  all right heres the deal  a safety inspector named butch hicks fell to his death  from an offshore oil rig last night and his body washed up onshore  the rig he was working on is the bamford number 7   thats where were headed  first of all let me just say  awesome ive always wanted to go on an oil rig  excuse me chief but how is this a police matter  from what youve said its an accident  thats what the coast guard thinks but im not so sure  we received an anonymous tip about a week ago  that we traced to a pay phone outside the dive shop on the pier  the caller said that something highly unsafe was going on  out on that rig and that he was risking everything to warn us   dude harbor seal  what  did you share this information about the anonymous tip with the coast guard  absolutely not  ive had dealings with them in the past and i dont trust em  if you suspect foul play shouldnt your lead detective be here wheres lassie  and juliet shouldnt she be here  the truth is what were doing isnt exact  were acting more in an unofficial capacity  more questions and im gonna turn this boat around take you both   back to shore understood  im all right with that   except that gus leg is touching mine  is not   he keeps looking at my ear  enough  now were gonna be there in about five  this is the us coast guard  stop your engine and prepare to be boarded  damn it  ill handle this  good morning  good morning what brings you out here   just doing a little sightseeing  is that right whats this  its a rig manifest you wouldnt be thinking of nosing in  on my accidental death case would you  cause thats my jurisdiction  sorry to break it to you commander but according to the gps  that southeast corner of the rig crosses back inside three miles  which brings it under my jurisdiction  you dont want to come up against me because you will lose  well see about that  hi commander im shawn spencer  amateur dolphinologist big fan of the briny and lemon squares  stay out of this  dont worry chief im sure the commander here  is a perfectly reasonable human person heres the thing  we received an anonymous tip  that there may be more going on here than meets the eye  so with your blessing of course wed like to go ahead  and check out the rig  anonymous tip you werent gonna share this information with me  like you ever shared anything with me   i could have you brought up on charge  you cant intimidate me  im giving you exactly ten seconds to get this vessel out of my waters  id like to see you make me  my nose is touching yours what do you think about that   can you do that to a commander  you can when shes your sister  dont you put your nose right up into mine again   what if i put it really close  what if i actually touch your nose  yes sir  i understand  judge ruled with me on jurisdiction didnt he  but that doesnt change the fact that i have far more experience   investigating homicides  but this wasnt a homicide   this was an accident  you dont know that for certain  i cant get over it  after all this time the chief never said she had a sister  its strange   and such an alluring sister at that  creepy  you should hear this i got the commanders bio  of the coast guard web site  commander b   commander barbara dunlap  graduated us coast guard academy with honors  conducted multiple search and rescue operations kodiak alaska  assumed command santa barbara station 2002  to date interdicted over 5 million of illegal narcotics  and has saved 57 lives   very impressive  impressive and intoxicating  i mean all that power in one woman  theres no photo   creepier  i know  i dont care about your socalled experience  you are not getting anywhere near my oil rig  too bad because we have a psychic mr spencer  who is gonna figure out who our anonymous tipster is  which could be pretty darn important to the investigation  it could since this is now in my jurisdiction  your psychic is my psychic  commander carlton lassiter head detective  i had no idea that the chief had such an accomplished younger sister  shes older  what are you doing standing there we have a missing persons case to work  id love to stay and chat but i have an investigation to conduct  spencer are you coming  may we have a moment with the chief commander  meet me at the ship and ill see you in an hour dont be late   chief i only said yes so that we  you dont owe me an explanation  you do what you have to do  is it just me or does she seem peeved  all im saying is so much for us being in chief vicks good graces   may have burned our bridge with her  dont be a myopic chihuahua  i have a foolproof plan that not only solves the case   gives chief all the credit  what is it  all i have is the phrase i have a foolproof plan  beyond that im wide open  we received an anonymous tip about a week ago  that we traced to a pay phone outside the dive shop on the pier  research time  give me everything you got on offshore oil rigs  generally oil platforms are located on a continental shelf   shelf got it  a typical platform has around   30 well heads  30 check  drilling continues 24 hours a day there are two crews on board at all times  one for the day shift one for the night  love brokers  night shift  come on dude you got the fonz playing against type  where is this boat  excuse us  is this where the coast guard boat launches from   are you shawn spencer  i am indeed  commander dunlap instructed me to give you this  gentlemen your job is to stay put and do nothing  i dont believe this she goes through all the trouble to hire us   and then leave us behind  dont you see whats happening here  we are merely pawns   in a bitter sibling feud  im nobodys pawn  im a queen  at least i can make my conference on foot fungus   we cannot quit  why not  because were not quitters were doing this for the chief remember   weve gotta get on that rig  but how  have a good trip mr bamford  the rig he was working on is the bamford number 7  thats where were headed  i have an idea but well need cool names   so mr turner  please call me tbone  tbone have you two invested in offshore drilling before  have we yes lordy  so youre familiar with the technology  id say its pretty straight forward  you got your basic rig with 30 warheads sitting on the continental countertop  running 24 crews day and night every two hours  that made absolutely no sense  the truth is were not that sophisticated in the oil business  i didnt think so  my father and i dont appreciate our time being wasted  youll have to pardon my daughter gentlemen  apparently yale university didnt teach her any manners  or how to get a husband  honey run down there into the galley  mix us up some cocktails while the men talk  sure  not to be rude billy joe but its the 21st century  women have earned the right to be treated equally  cut the crap son  blind men could see that you two arent investors  technically a blind man cant see anything  i offered you a ride out here so i could take a look at you  figure out what you were up to  what are you government watchdogs  epa  is this about that little oil spill  you had a oil spill out here  the truth is that we have not been completely honest with you  were working for the coast guard my name is shawn spencer  this is my partner chesterfield mcmillan and wife  we are investigating the death of your safety inspector  and whether or not it was truly an accident  but we were running late so we missed the boat ride out here  as much as i dont appreciate being lied to  if youre right about hickss death not being an accident  i want to know about it as much as you do  what can i do to help you  first thing well need to see is mr hickss personal effects  and i will be needing a little baby umbrella in my mal tal   whats our missing persons name  dr christopher renaud   hes a professor at the university  and last seen  his 300 lecture on thursday  were gonna need a list of all the people in attendance that day  ive obtained a list from the ta  ive set up interviews with each and every one of his students  good work ohara   one more thing  shoot  i am thinking of asking out commander dunlap on a date  your thoughts  i think its a bad idea  really  why  for starters you know shes the chiefs sister  not to mention they dont get along theyre screaming at each other  see it  i devoured it it was incredible  shes a real snap pea isnt she  shes got that great sturdy build  yeah  why dont we focus on interviewing our witnesses for the missing persons case  absolutely forget i even mentioned that other thing  i will  there was an anonymous tip  that something unsafe was going on out here  any clue as to what the caller might have been referring to  i have no idea this place is run strictly by the book  butch hicks made sure of that and so do i  you can ask anybody  my professional reputation is based on safety  watch your head going in here now  somebody put a rail on this side of this ladder  thats a violation  heres hickss office  lets see   whats in here  thats the geologists lab  my daughters trying to get me all hightech  she thinks because i punched a few dry holes  that ive lost my touch and she talked me into hiring this  fancy rock doctor  showing me where to dig  i dont need nobody to tell me where to dig  once this well comes in like i know  its going to  im gonna be back on top again  you guys take your time  if you need me ill be topside  if you need us well be bottomsup   what are we looking for  anything that will help us figure out  who the anonymous tipster was  or a kit kat im starving  since hicks was in charge of safety on the rig  its safe to assume the tipster may have come to him first  i have this big stack of safety violation reports  man this guy hicks was a real stickler  if by stickler you mean a guy who doesnt have  any snacks i agree with that  what are you two doing here  not eating candy i can tell you that  my orders for you were to stay put and do nothing  really that wasnt reverse psychology  out  wait  i was drawn to this office  with very powerful psychic visions  of a man in scuba gear with a salamander in his wetsuit  well thank you mr spencer but i dont see how thats helpful  or healthy  wait im seeing more  the anonymous tipster  i can tell you where he is  really and wheres that  the morgue  commander look  my myriad psychic detective skills assure me that the anonymous tipster  is safety inspector butch hicks   your psychic detective skills  you left out myriad   right  wait theres more  i see a security camera in front of the dive shop  all you have to do is review fridays tape and youll see that im right  fine lets say you are right it doesnt change anything  all the evidence still points to his death being an accident lets go  as long as im in charge of this case you will follow my orders to the letter  my orders are that you get off this rig  we have a shuttle leaving in an hour you will be on it  is it just me or is that woman a tinge bossy  she scares me  lets hop to it  we have less than an hour to interview every worker on the night shift  no lets discuss something that wont get us into trouble  like where were gonna eat when we get back to shore  all that kit kat talk made me hungry  this may be the only chance we have  to weed out who might have wanted to kill hicks  if the commander finds us shes gonna go ape  do i smell meatloaf  and fresh apple cobbler if im not mistaken  i guess it wont hurt to ask a few questions  well hello miss ashley  would you kindly direct my buddy and i to the chuck wagon please  im sorry  we would like to know where the mess hall is  its two decks down  awesome would you like to have lunch with us  perhaps afterwards you could give us a little tour  regardless of how my father treats me  im not the cruise director here  so tell me about the safety inspector  that guy was always writing me up for the smallest infraction  i hate to say it but im glad hes dead  theres no dairy in that is there  you know i had a dream that i knifed him in his sleep  but i woke up  hicks should have never gone into no mans land  no mans land  its the area thats strictly offlimits during crane operation  hicks should have known better i mean he was a safety inspector  anyway its a shame if someone loosened that tackle and killed him  you know youre the first person to show any mpathy for hicks  what  no im saying if it was me i would have used a gun  this place is lousy with suspects  and excessively heavy food  i think i ate my weight in that cowboy chicken casserole  man this food was disgusting  all i had was a half a bran muffin whats our next move  well i think we need to get into hickss house  if there really was a conspiracy  to kill him were gonna need hard evidence  when we get back to shore we go see chief vick  first we go home change into our jammies take a nap  then we wake up have some juice  then straight to vick  all right well call me if anyone matching that description shows up  thanks  hey jules   chief in her office  ladies room  darn gus and i really need to speak to her  think you can give us a numeral so we can gauge just how long shell be  i dont know five seven minutes maybe   how about number one or number two  i have no idea shawn  and no i am not gonna go to the ladies room and check on her for you   is this your missing person  dr christopher renaud  hes a professor at the university been missing for a week   what are you two doing here  oh we have our answer   tinkle  chief we need your help  oh you need my help  oh ive got to give you credit mr spencer  you have more than your share of gumption   this will only take a minute  come on for old times sake  one minute no more  chief i read every single worker on that rig  and they all hated hicks  im getting two very distinct psychic vibes here  the first  there was a conspiracy behind hickss death  second craig t nelson will donate his remaing hair to the smithsonian  yeah look chief we need help learning more about hicks  and a good start would be access to where he lived  i still dont understand why youre coming to me with this  i mean why dont you go to the commander  she really doesnt want us involved with this case  really imagine that  im sorry i cant help you  as the commander pointed out this case is out of my jurisdiction  and your minute is up  gus will you excuse us i need to speak with the chief in private  no problem  just so you know it was shawns idea for us to go with your sister  karen  chief karen  chief karen vick  that just feels a little long doesnt it  i said im busy mr spencer  im sensing something here  dont do that  look the only reason i took this case was to help you  oh really help me how  if i can tie that murder to a piece of evidence on land  the case is back in your jurisdiction  well thats actually kind of sweet  dont tell anyone i used that word  deal  now i know its none of my business but  what is going on with you and commander babs  its complicated  believe me i know what it feels like growing up with  an older sister who gets all the attention  i didnt know you had an older sister spencer  i dont  but i did watch a lot of reruns ofthe brady bunch  you know  barbara and i werent always like this  i mean we used to be  well close  i know exactly how you feel and by i i mean jan  so was it something  specific that brought things to a head  no nothing specific  its just years of trying to outdo each other  so  should i go divine that piece of evidence i was referring to  i dont know should you  shawn  im sorry buddy  there we go  right in there  looks like hickss obsession with safety did not extend to his colon  vick will go ballistic if she found out we broke in here  we didnt break in the window was open now come on   what the heck are we looking for  anything hicks may have received  with the threat of violence correspondence   angry phone messages mash notes  mash notes are love letters shawn  really  remind me i owe someone a huge apology  lets start with this computer  i guess i have to break the pass code  panther21   panther21  just try it  thats it  you got all that just from putting together things from around the room  no it was written on the computer i saw the reflection on the cd case  all right  almost all of his recent emails are from someone called bishop77  why havent you called me back  the situation on the rig is getting more serious every day  why are you ignoring me  dude listen to this one  if you dont do something about this ill go to the authorities  you know what this means  bishop77 is the anonymous tipster not hicks  and if we could figure out who he is  we could find out whats really going on out on that rig  and who killed hicks and why bishop77   hes catholic or he plays chess  i got it i got it  a guy at work showed me how to take an email address  and get its owners real name  ill start by using an email header to trace back to the original ip address  what  dear god what are you doing  shawn what did i tell you about eating onions during lunch  it makes your breath stink thats why i bought you those mints  use them  i didnt eat onions during lunch i ate everything but onions  i dont smell anything  that smells good  that smells really good  dude its coming from inside here  well open it up  why does it always have to be a dead guy   why does he smell like onions  will you help me  who do you think it is   is this your missing person  dr christopher renaud  thats lassiter and juliets missing person   mr spencer whats this about  whoa whoa wait he works for me  mr spencer whats this about  the reason i called the two of you is because  theres something in this house that concerns you both  oh please dont tell me you went into hicks house without a warrant  hey warrant no one talked to me about a warrant  i need a warrant all of a sudden  im a diviner it all happens here  and here  and in extreme cases here  okay what exactly is in there  a missing person professor renaud  thats our missing person  but we never found a connection between he and hicks  well check it out  what would renaud be doing in hickss house   and how does this affect my case  oh wait im getting something  talked me into hiring this fancy rock doctor  showing me where to dig  well i dont need anybody to show me where to dig  renaud worked as a consulting geologist  for hickss employer bamford exploration  its renaud spencers right  not words i enjoy saying  okay then  well id say that ties up the missing person case quite nicely  this is usually the place where you say nice work spencer  im sorry i didnt catch that  the victim worked for bamford drilling  what does that have to do with hickss murder  if you dont mind  let me ask the questions because in case you havent noticed were on land  which brings this case back into my jurisdiction   listen to yourself will you  my jurisdiction  youre only interested in this case because youre   itching to horn in on my turf  itching  oh my listen to yourself  your turf  were talking about a whole ocean not the tv room  whoa whoa sisters please  nobodys getting horned here  two men are dead  this is not the time for petty sibling squabbles  thats what thanksgiving is for  we need to come together and work as a group to get to the truth  and the truth is  rnaud is our anonymous tipster not hicks  i can see a series of emails from renaud to hicks  the safety inspector warning him  that something unsafe was happening on that rig  but hicks he refuses to address the issue  probably because hes covering something up  and then fearing that the truth would get out he ext pssh  stop hammer time whoosh  hicks kills renaud  the question is what was hicks trying to hide  thank you for that eloquent summation mr spencer  its my pleasure chief i think our next move should be  for me to have lassiter and ohara now look into it  wait wait okay this is great  barbara just witnessed the chief choose me over spencer  in her eyes my stock just went up  now if i could just get her to witness me discharge my weapon  well mr spencer this case does warrant further investigation  on my end as well  absolutely thank you commander  i think the first thing we need to investigate is why hicks was in  no mans land  the safety inspector of all people should have known better  ill have my people look into that  by the way youre fired  fired  nobody fires me shawn  what do we do next  i cant stop asking myself why was the geologists office  the only door that was locked im telling you something was in there  we gotta get back on that rig but how   i have an idea  is it good  not really  dad w wait wait wait  ah thank god  shawn what are you doing here  you know what gus and i thought maybe wed go out with you today  thats a first every time i ask you to go out fishing you  come up with some lame excuse what was it last time  it was one word the books  thats funny  what can i say  were both in the mood for some serious angling   we heard the big ones are biting  thats not what i heard  the storm scared all the fish away  wait a minute what did you hear is biting  its not pike is it  as a matter of fact it was pike man the pike is biting  yeah well pike is a freshwater fish  in case you morons havent noticed thats the ocean out there  all right shawn whats up what do you want  we believe the evidence we need to solve a case is on an offshore oil rig  its the bamford number seven  we were hoping that you could give us a lift out there  cant do it sorry guys  even if i was so inclined this boat isnt designed to go out that far  dad come on this is important its not just about solving the case  we gotta get back in vicks good graces  cannot do it  shocking  but i think i got a friend over here  captain dale might be able to help you out  course youll have to do some chores  chores   can i come in  what do you want barb  here to argue some more about jurisdiction  actually no  yeah well i have a lot of work to do so  well the thing is is i had my people look into what spencer said  what was hicks doing out in no mans land  did somebody lure him out there  so i took a trip out to the rig  had a look at the crane it turns out the crane had been tampered with  hicks was murdered  and i was wrong  spencer was right  about hicks murdering renaud  his prints were all over the murder weapon  well then we need to find spencer and see what else hes figured out   lead the way  can i   yeah  lets go  damn that captain dale  i still smell like fish i hate fish  thats not true you love my cajun crawfish hushpuppies  thats mostly cornmeal and you know that  look what you did to my credit card you ruined it  dude it had a 297 interest rate i did you a favor  stop complaining start looking  you good on litmus paper  what the heck is that  looks like a map  br number seven  i dont need nobody to tell me where to dig  why would renaud hand draw a map that already existed  remember that map we saw in the corridor  go grab it  thats what renaud meant by they were doing something unsafe  theyre not drilling where they say theyre drilling  theyre drilling directly on a fault line  this is a private lab what are you two doing in here  dude i got this  ashley the truth is that im a psychic a damn good one ive been told  i am sensing that there is stuff going on that will be hard  for you to hear  very hard  very very hard  damn girl you are so lean   what do you spin  i thought you said you got this  sorry im im seeing faults  faulty something faulty intelligence  faulty wiring fawlty towers  fault  your father  is drilling into a fault line   what  yeah he made a fake map  with the help of dr dre  no dr pepper  no dr no no dr dr renaud   our geologist  thats right theres more  unfortunately i think your father may be responsible  for the deaths of dr renaud and hicks  i think hes trying to cover his tracks  im im sorry i cant believe that  dad would do that  i know  hes always been a risktaker  willing to gamble everything  if he thought there was oil to be found  but i cant believe that he would do this   i feel sick  its okay   were gonna get through this together  probably over dinner  i was thinking tapas but i could be talked into greek   we need to stop drilling immediately  right  and as far as dinner goes lets just put a pin in it  communications room is down the hall well radio up to the floor  and tell them to suspend operations  the light is on the opposite wall   ill turn on the radio  i know it isnt easy   your father isnt   this is the radio room  sweetie pop come on now  you shouldnt have come back out here shawn  now im gonna have to figure out a way to get rid of you  i might have made a mistake  she fills those jeans out quite nicely though  shawn that sign says toxic fumes i am breathing in toxic fumes  come on dude  you think they gonna expose employees to stuff thats really harmful  did you not seesilkwood shawn  theyre gonna make me take a shower where they scrub my skin off  miss bamford can we talk to you   can it wait im really busy  sorry honey it cant wait  hickss death wasnt an accident that he was murdered  it looks like we have solid alibis from everybody on the rig that night  the pilot said there was a passenger who wasnt on the manifest  that passenger was you miss bamford   why were you out there that night  and why didnt you want your name on the manifest  well thats simple i was you see  sometimes i like to make surprise visits   shes got a weapon  halt  we gotta get outta here  when you hear gunfire you dont go towards it  were in here were in here  jules lassie thank god its ashley bamford shes armed  we know were in pursuit you two stay put   do you understand  got it  it is confusing to you  the put part stay put i wasnt put in the first place gus  the expression is a complete disaster look   whats her 20  on the left 30 feet  its more like 35 feet  why do you always have to feel like you have to correct me  was i correcting i dont mean it   yeah  im sorry   what

i see  i see a gorgeous young woman with a smart jacket  and an impressive education and even more impressive  arm muscle tone  who desperately wanted to save  her fathers crumbling business  i know thats why you had renaud make the fake map  so that nobody would know  fault line  and when butch hicks found out about it you did what any good child  would do in your place  you had no choice  you had to kill him  i couldnt have let hicks or anyone else get in the way   you understand that dont you shawn  of course i do  are you kidding me  i completely understand  what are you doing give me that  give me that gun  its okay  come here  did barbara see that  well i gotta say mr spencer nice work  thanks chief no help to my table  no help to my table  this really isnt necessary i already told you guys youre forgiven  i should be giving you gifts for bringing me and my sister back together  chief stop it  the only gift well ever need from you is your sweet toothy smile  and any possible cases you might want to send our way  but mostly the toothy smile  well ahoy commander welcome aboard   thar she blows  all hands on deck  enough the painfully cute mugging is starting to get on my nerves  what are you entertainment weekly   so we still on for lunch kare  absolutely  this is kind of awkward  but im thinking of asking out detective lassiter  what do you think   you donwant
