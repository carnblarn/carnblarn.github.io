so up opera she left it on  i wasnt watching at all i was taking a nap actually  do you sleep with your eyes wide open  okay shawn yes maybe i was half watching not  because i like it but because its educational  pay close attention you might learn a little something too  i had a vasec to my two years ago  that logan is probably cheating on skye  no shawn im talking about sharpening your skills  look watch her closely  tell me what you see  shes looking into the light  bingo looking directly into the lights  makes her eyes tear up she cries  seen perps do it all the time in the interrogation room  so actings really just a lie  of course shawn what you think those goof balls on chips are really cops  wow anything else you wanna ruin for me  i dont think were allowed to be on one of these things shawn  if they didnt want us to drive it why did they leave the key sunder the seat  this is not how i wanna be spending my saturday morning  dude lassie called man he called us us the team  besides this is a real live television studio gus what could be better  eating my breakfast  i was having a poached egg with hollandaise sauce on an english muffin  look well solve it up quick  youll be back home in no time hello  dame judi dench called she wants her breakfast back  did you just do the something called and want sits something back bit  look around gus these are my people   who are your people  these people  artists thinkers dreamers guy dressed as toast  now if i were a crime scene where would i be  here i am  hey i know this place   this is corrines living room  who the hell is corrine  its the living room from explosion gigantesca de romance   what are you saying  its a spanish soap opera shawn  how do you know that who are you what happened to my best friend  my gosh and lassiter is talking to jorge gamalobo  he plays vicente on the show hes my favorite  he slept with mariana at his own mothers funeral shawn  what the  its on in every doctors office i visit  i had no choice but to get sucked in  you had a choice you still have a choice  whos the dead guy  thats rinaldo nunez  he played ernesto on the show he used to be married to corrine  im sorry dude i cant believe you actually watch this show  its in spanish  everyone in santa barbara is watching it shawn  the tele novela is a craze  okay what ever this case is i want in on it  and i dont care how you do it  spencer thank god youre here  now go home  we dont need you ohara jumped the gun this things pretty much open and shut  jules  if you want to spend more time with me you dont have to trump up some case  you just pick up the phone give me a call say shawn im here ive got pudding pops  ill keep that in mind  fact is we have tape of  mr gamalobo here actually stabbing the victim on camera  will someone listen to me please  for the last time i had no idea the collapsible  prop knife had been replaced with the real one  i believe him  hes your favorite actor really  that felt a little forced to me  spencer why are you still here i told you to run along  hurry up ask a question that proves theres more here than meets the eye  i have a question  are those delicious looking sandwiches for everybody  yes for everyone working on the stage here  thank you  thats it thats your question  follow up question   do you have salami  not by it self no  but as part of another sandwich with other italian meats  thats interesting  i like that very much  all right everybody lets bag and wrap this up  sir youre gonna need to come with us for some more questions  help me please  who ever you are  unbelievable shawn i ask for one case one case and you couldnt get us in on it  dude im sorry theres no case here  lassies actually right  your boy stabbed some dude on camera in front of everybody look  what   theres no tells  what  look at the moment when the knife goes into nunez   it looks like it hurts  yeah but look there gamalobos face  he doesnt look angry he looks fright  more importantly he looks surprised  that is not the face of a premeditated killer  so what does that mean   i think it means we have a case  yes  a big fat doublestuffed chalupa of a case with guacamole  yes  thats too hard i hate you ernesto die  come on dude im stabbing you in the heart  give me something to work with here  okay look thats a very interesting theory  mr spencer but the tape is pretty damning evidence  chief all due respect hed have to be the worst criminal of all time  or the smartest  of course hes gonna claim he didnt know the knife was switched  arent we getting ahead of ourselves   mr gamalobo isnt under arrest  yet  the producers have just temporarily suspended him from the show   they pulled him off the show  temporarily  until more progress is made in the investigation  but you cant do that  hes right in the middle of an important love triangle with corrine  and we havent even found out whether serenas baby is his or not  what i meant to say was  the man is an actor  on a television program it is his job his live lihood  you cant just take away a mans means to sustain himself  to put food on the table   i need to know if that babys his  i have just one question  if this is about food im telling you right now i will not be a happy man  how do you explain the hair on the knife  the what  i am sensing there was a long hair in the evidence bag  a womans hair  perhaps belong in to a ted nugent impersonator  but one thing is certain  it didnt come from the head of mr gamalobo  was there a hair in the bag  actually there was we havent run it through the lab yet  why not  because chief we feel the most damning piece of evidence that tape  the hair could have come from anywhere the evidence guy who bagged it  officer henze is bald detective  i am sensing  that the owner of that hair is our killer  chief you give us one day one day  and you have our word well make sure this blatant departmental screwup  doesnt bring down the entire santa barbara police world  universe  galaxy  one day  but the best news is  now that were officially on the case we have craft service privileges  which means all the gummy bears and poppycock we can jam in our bellies  but we only have one day to eat them lets get to work shawn  thats lance rothstein lets start with him  hes the head writer on the show  i saw his picture once in soap diary magazine  head writer hes not even spanish  no he was a hollywood guy  used to write on blossom  decided spanish soap operas were a better reflection of the human condition  obviously he didnt write the blossom  where she adopted a chimp and hit the road in an 18wheeler   that was bj and the bear shawn  you tell them that line is cut   dont listen to them theyre actors  floyd rothstein  lance rothstein you have a moment were big fans  no i dont have a moment i dont mean to be rude  you have a head shot just drop it off in the casting department right off the lobby  no sir were not actors  youre not fur the shing from it im a psychic  i dont really not interested in getting my fortune told   mr  spencer shawn spencer  this is my partner lavender gooms  were here with the police investigating the nunez case  mr rothstein im burton guster  we were here yesterday at the crime scene  and we know that jorge gamalobo was not responsible for the death of rinaldo nunez   he wasnt  no  shocking i know that and i dont work with crystal balls  make a note i just let that go  it would have been way too easy  yeah look while were talking here  a murderer is wandering around loose on my set  which is not comforting for someone with my weak constitution  i al ready have here ditary angina and shin splints  listen are you sure that you are not an actor  because you really do have a certain look  what a shallow look  no i have to go  whoa i still have some more questions  look if i do not shoot this scene  right now then later in the week were gonna be doing this show live  why dont you find me later on the set all right  okay but what would really be help ful right now is  if you just gave us mr gamalobos home address so that we could go there and interview him  that is not necessary the man has been doing this show eight years  his wife left him this is his home address  im sensing a hair in the evidence baggie  man it just irks me  i still think we should bring in some of other cast members for questioning  heres the thing ohara its not that complicated  motivation opportunity execution  with nunez out of the picture jorges role on the show gets larger  motivation  knowing in advance that its scripted that he would stab nunez presents opportunity  the fact that he was unmistakably caught on film actually  stabbing the victim hello execution  soon as we get those lab results back well be done thank you   whos that  pascoretti penny a newbie  just transferred in from the 302 out of oakland  its about time  we could use some new blood  i hate new blood  of course you do  i welcome it  especially new female blood  it gets lonely here in this sea of testosterone  well you go right ahead knock yourself out  make a new friend  maybe you could have a little tea party  braid each others hair for all i care  hello im detective ohara but you can call me juliet  anyway i just wanted to introduce myself and welcome you here  and let you know if you need any help with anything dont hesitate to ask  does it look like i dont know how to write my own name and badge number  bffs  best friends forever  shut up lassiter  mr gamalobo  we just have a few questions for you  call me jorge please  jorge  come on thats a little silly  thats your name thats cool  we know you didnt do it   you do  we think you were framed  this is music to my earlobes  do you have questions for me  yes we do  do you know if serenas baby is yours   what  serenas baby  gus  im sorry  are those meat balls from craft service  yes kelly knows they are my favorite  usually i hunger for her meat balls the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum  but sadly i have no appetite for them now  grab the one doesnt have a fork in it  theyre still steaming the little whoa  whos this over here  that is my family  yes they are all back in mexico i  left them to do the show   your brother  its my sister  no he means this person right here  yes yes its my sister  no he means this one right here  where my finger is  yes yes its my sister  she is quite lovely  in a young keith hernandez  sort of you must miss them very much  yes  i sense violence  an altercation  here in this room  someone had something against you here  yes yes quintessa  quintessa gabrielle  she plays corrine on the show  she is gorgeous  you dont know her wrath  she hates me shes like the latina susan lucci  she beat me up  i hardly think theres woman capable of that  bea arthur  i stand corrected  scuse us  would you please just just come out and talk to me  go away  i promise you i swear to you i will change the line  i was misinformed  theres gotta be another spanish word for nipple just tell me what it is  hi how you doing  im just going to the writersroom where its emotionally damaging  but its physically safe  lets go after her  whoa maybe now isnt the best time to approach her  youre right we only have a day to solve the case  we should wait and hang out  ill do the heavy lifting and charm her you grab a piece of her hair  grab a piece of her hair why  so we can compare it to the one on the murder weapon  how am i gonna graba piece of her hair shawn  i dont know what else i can tell you  i told the policeman every thing i know  policeman  yes the talls curvylike one with no rhythm  detective lassiter   yes that was his name  were you and rinaldo nunez close  well we were working together but  but no i didnt know him very well at all   im a professional  i see  was he ever in your dressing room  i should say not  thats strange  im seeing him in your dressing room  are you a psychic or some kind of witch  okay  so maybe sometimes he came to my  dressing room to rehearse lines or something  no hes not running lines  hes holding a feather duster dipping him self in pancake batter  and hes quite naked  okay so shes definitely boinking nunez  does that make her a suspect  well she did lie about it  why  well he does wear bikini briefs  sweet  dude   this isnt a hair  what  its just part of her scrunchie look  its all elasticy its got a piece of be dazzle in it  its made out of yarn good work buddy  forget it ill figure out how to pluck one myself  i think we should split up  you hit the props department see what you can find out about our weapon  im gonna pop into the stage and grill lance about the quintess a jorge relationship  jorge  camera two push in  hold it there  go  so this is where all the magic happens  yes smell the dream  can i ask you a question i think  im sorry im just gonna watch  what the hell is he doing what does he got a twitch or something  im afraid thats called his acting  hes only got a couple of lines  its always the bit players  is he flirting with her  that was the idea  he should be more subtle than that man luke  you dont seduce a woman with your forehead and your adams apple  its right here its always been here  it doesnt start there you know  i mean youre over here and then  how would you do the line  do do what  you know  no i cant whoa i just  well thats the thing  jorge would never have known that the knife was real  the blades are virtually identical actually  we build the propas close to the specs of your average sixinch blade as we can  i mean we do that obviously for the look of the knife  but also it gives like a realistic feel for the actor you know the size the weight  the texture so on  here you wanna hold it go on hold it   it feels real  but its not  thats the fake one see  the blade retracts collapses right into the handle  you wanna try it   no i couldnt  come on stab me   no really i shouldnt  come on go ahead  hey its fun trust me  all right  just messing with you  do you mind if i borrow this to show my partner  its for the investigation  okay shawn this is what i found out so far  turns out the knife may have changed hands up  to six times before nunez was stabbed with it  the day is almost up and weve gotten nowhere it could be anyone on this set  we need more access and more time  i think ive figured outa pretty good angle for that buddy  i just need you to step aside for one second  maybe hit the craft service table  grab us a couple of those potato latkes  i cant figure out how kelly makes them so crispy  im not stepping any where shawn  am i the only one doing any work here on this case  id love to go to work im ready i feel it i just i cant  really and why is that   youre standing right in my eye line buddy  what  quiet on the set  four three two  and action  thanks for coming into speak with us ms desmondo  youre welcome  im gonna get right to it  can you recall any in stances in which you witnessed  jorge gamalobo engaging in violent behavior   yes  yes  yes  please tell us  it was seven years ago  when he pushed diego cabrera off a bridge in broad day light  wait that happened in this state   when was he charged  he wasnt  he beat the rap  but there was an eye witness  his thoughttobemissing step brother juan sandoval  sandoval that sounds familiar  mcnab get in here  i need you to run all information on a juan sandoval  juan sandoval  wasnt hey our common law husband  wait he was your husband  common law  but you murdered himby freezing his body and then  shipping it to hawaii and defrosting it by a volcano  exactly  that was fifth season episode eleven  im a fan  are you two talking about the show  im talking about a real murder  i actually saw that episode  but he came back in season six right  as the chief surge on so that he could change velmas face  so that you could take the rap for beatrices murder  its the only episode i saw  who writes this crap  the writers are all so color fuland brilliant  theyre wonderful with the brutal crimes  they are some kind of geniuses i swear  some kind of murder geniuses maybe  i have a package for you   special delivery  it says  handle with care  hes really got something am i right  yes hes my muse  cut  easy  thats what happens when you hire people off the street  shes

quintessas head   because our dressing rooms side by side  nice  how many times do you two need to be told you are not needed on this case  you are wasting the departments resources  hey pal  please

quintessa gabrielles hair is real  so theres no match but  nice work chad  what kind of show do you think were doing gotta keep it grounded  you gotta keep it real wanna go back to being an intern  excuse me i am doing something here not nothing  shes already making love to her nephew she cant also be a nun  yes can i help you very quickly  i have a warrant to search these premises confiscate all scripts and written material  on what grounds  on the grounds youve all been very busy thinking up ingenious ways to kill people  all that plus the latest in local sports with dan the man coming up at 1100 pm  the package is for you mrs   lourdes  its ms please   what the hell  well in that case   sign here   jorge gamalobo tried to kill himself  tried and failed  must have been so wracked with guilt over stabbing nunez he decided to off himself   did he leave a note  oh yeah  admitting to the murder its already with the boys down at the lab  i just wanted to get in there get a verbal confession  youve got to be kidding me  step away from the bed now  dont you shush me  i was about to say theres still time for you to go downstairs to the gift shop and buy something   maybe a teddy bear  oh thats nice  teddy bears are cute  they have one with a jar of honey that says bee well   i mean it this time i will arrest you for interfering in police business  im gonna have to ask you two to leave   this man is very sick and i need quiet in here   us  excuse me im detective ohara and this is detective lassiter and were investigating this man  and i demand you remove these men from this room  honey the only people actually authorized to be in here are mr spencer and mr guster  theyre on mr gamalobos friends and family list   everyone else out  you just met him a week ago  his whole family is back in mexico his older brother misses him very much   his sister  right  how does he make friends so fast  i get that jorge was depressed about being off the show but murdersuicidecoma  this whole thing is starting to feel like a real soap opera to me  i cant believe he would take his own life  unless he was wearing a wig  he didnt  someone else did  what  i dont get it  really  i thought i wrapped it up so nicely for you just now  it felt really good it was organic  synthetic hair  just like the one found on the knife  so  dude  it means the same person was there  when jorge tried to kill himself   he wasnt alone  so wait youre saying   he didnt try to kill himself  i cant do this  youre not being clear shawn  come on dude  i gave it to you three different ways  did he or did he not try to kill himself  is that the gamalobo suicide note  yes but im still waiting on the hand writing samples from the lab  nah forget that just read it to me  okay dear world i ask for forgiveness for the sins i have committed against humanity  it was my hands that carried out a heinous murder   wait a minute  hold on a second   i know that  you know that  i have been literally poring over these things for days  hold on a second  okay continue  how can i go back and reverse time  i have no choice but to say goodbye   to a world i turned my back on and the woman i betrayed    wow its from a script  word for word  written by lance rothstein  so lance set him up  what did he just get lazy did he think no one would remember  hes gonna have plenty of time to figure out new plot lines behind bars  so this is what it feels like to be in jail  i always wondered if id survive   i was in jail once  really  this is what it was like for you too  yeah yeah pretty much  you know i mean these phones arent real  no course not i mean you know it would be too expensive  but i mean for ernestos prison scene tomorrow its great right  oh yeah yeah  lance rothstein youre under arrest   for what  the murder of rinaldo nunez  dont worry i can get you off on that one  and the attempted murder of jorge gamalobo  ooh i dont know about that one  dont get up im not staying  we just had a huge breakin that murder case i was working on  so now the paperwork  i just wanted to stop by and  give you this  what is that   a cupcake  i can see that but  why are you giving it to me  i noticed that you were eating one with your lunch the other day so i stopped and bought you one  same kind red velvet  you um you noticed what i was eating  well yeah im a detective   i notice details  really  what else did you notice about me  well i notice that you eat by yourself every day  i notice that you hesitate to make eye contact with people  and well you can  be a little abrasive  but you know thats probably just because its hard to adapt  you know lots of politics  its hard to understand where everyones coming from  dont worry  i think im getting a pretty good idea  good  im glad  dad youre here  i am  you have to try this sandwich   kelly from craft service makes them for me  i already ate lunch shawn why am i here  this isnt lunch  this is turkey with stuffing and cranberry  its like thanks giving between two slices of bread  this whole place is like leaving las vegas with food  shawn whyd you ask me here  i thought youd enjoy it  you said you never had the opportunity to visit me when i was working a real job and now i have a real job   shawn this is not a real job  sure it is  oh no i think i got makeupon this tshirt has anyone seen ivan  acting is not a real job shawn i mean how much attention do you need  im not doing this for the attention  i happen to be solving a case  a murder this is serious business ive got a guy sitting in jail  lassiters got some evidence against him but i know he didnt do it  it doesnt make any sense hes a writer hes got no motive  well motive is everything no motive no conviction  how do you have fans  this is asinine you started on the show five days ago   look i have something  did you ever think  that maybe this is embarrassing for me   embarrassing for you  first off your accent is terrible  its disgraceful really  you sound like that el pollo loco guy  and then there you go turning your back on rinaldo  even after he defended you when you were accused of marias kidnapping come on  first of all i am trying to sound like the el pollo loco guy  and secondly rinaldo turned his back on me when he slept with maria in the first place  oh come on he would have given you half the reward money  wheres your integrity it makes you look like such a bad person  im shawn  those are things that my character chad did  i play him on tv  its shawn shawny  look into your boys eyes  its me papa  dont be an idiot im not one of your fans  i barely even like you  thats it  if my own father can blur the lines between the show and reality why couldnt someone else  weve been looking in the wrong place  its fans  okay so youve narrowed it down to 150 suspects  good work shawn  i want your baby  i want your baby  i dont have any female fans listen lance  lassiter doesnt have enough to make this arrest stick  hes just hoping that a couple nights in jail will get you to confess  a couple nights no no no no  heres the thing  i actually like it in here  this is fuel for the show its fuel for me  i always felt there was something holding me back as a writer  i grew up in beverly hills and i always felt that i lacked any  real life experience  shawn this is so good for me  its like heming way like ellroy steinbeck danielle steel   ethan hawke  judy blume  exactly i can wallow in the harsh under belly of prison life  and shake it up a little bit with the riffraff  uh the riffraff  this is the santa barbara jail  not san quentin  it was written up in fodors last year as a nice spa alternative  we need to get you out of here so you can write the show everyone needs you  no no no i can write in here  i can scratch it out with a broken piece of lead in the dark and then i can  bury myself in the one nondown pillow they issued meand i can cry myself to sleep  look we need to talk about corrine   corrine  corrine   oh corrine  yes it came to me in a vision  the murderer is doing this to protect her  think about it  first ernesto cheated on her  and was stabbed and killed  then you wrote that vincente be trayed her and went missing someone  took it into their own hands and tried to kill him  well not vincente but jorge  thats my point  they cant tell the difference   its a fan  thats interesting  im not disagreeing but whats act two  i mean lets say it is just one fan how you gonna find one fan among thousands  easy thats where you come in  you just write me a storyline where i put corrines life in jeopardy  then we wont have to go looking for the murderer  the murderer will come looking for me  ow again  why  you wanted to see me chief  is there a problem  did the rothstein arrest not stick  this isnt about the nunez case  this is about the new transfer penny pascoretti  wanted to hear your side  my side my side of what  well i dont know a delicate way to put this  ms pascoretti has filed an interdepartmental harassment charge against you  what thats outrageous  is there any truth to this claim  i was just being nice  reaching out i bought her a cupcake   sue me  she is  what do you mean you bought her a cupcake  with this piece of information youre lucky the charge didnt include a stalking claim  i was just trying to make a friend  im going to give you a piece of advice and take it  as a woman in this department you have to be very careful how you go about forming friendships  women in the line of police work are more cautious by nature and necessity and slow to trust  well if thats the case i guess no woman has a friend in the department  thats right  oh cause i kind of thought we were friends  well you were wrong  ill talk to ms pascoretti and see what i can do to mitigate these charges  but in the meantime stop buying pastries  youre excused  nice blouse  thanks  i got it at nord strom it was on the sale rack   i probably shouldnt  i dont care  but you asked enough ohara goodbye  we have a problem  the shows fallen behind  and the network says the only way we can stay on schedule is if we do the show on friday live  which means we need a script tonight   is that possible  are you kidding me   ive never been more inspired in my life  sweet heres the catch  now that youve had me cheat on corrine  i need you to put out new pages with a new murder weapon and a scene where corrine comes after me  thats a terrible pitch why would i do that  because lance the murderers going to try and finish the job  whoever it is has access to the scripts  and will be paying very close attention to the murder weapon  and will likely tamper with it tomorrow  but ill be there to catch them  all right spencer i trust youre confident this elaborate charade is going to be fruitful for the case  confidence is not my problem  dry lips however pearl make it nice for the kissers  mr spencer were ready for you on set were moments away from going live  okay so whats our plan  well lance wrote this long monologue for corrine after my exit  that gives me plenty of time to make my costume change so ill meet you backstage then   keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious  got it  were seconds away from live places everybody places  in four three two  and go  darling you looking lovely   but we should get going   if we are going to make it   to serenas charity ball  tell me chad  do i look fat in this ball gown  you look like a   sweet nectarine   wrapped in taffeta  i didnt write that   improvisation i like it  yes  well i need you to be a dear   and after you get your suit on   will you grab   my nail gun  what  youre taking a nail gun   to serenas charity ball  no silly  the shelf has been loose   for a while now   and i need to fix it  but now my little rabbit  yes  be a love   and look for it in the garage  okay  oh this cant be good  dude did anyone come near the prop table  what prop table  ive been glued to the tv watching for anything suspicious to happen like you said  dude youre just standing there eating a meat ball watching the show  youre supposed to be watching the prop table  you never said anything about a prop table shawn  if you would a said watch the prop table i would have been watching the prop table  whoever tampered with that nail gun is our killer gus   were talking about my life here  i know shawn this woman is crazy   shes gonna kill you  look forget it okay just forget it  ill check the nail gun myself  do me a favor and save me one of those meat balls yeah  lets go you gotta get out there  this is no time for pranks roger theres still half a scene before i make my entrance  not anymore shes all over the place she just skipped ahead three pages youre on   gus  be strong shawn   he will be dead  oh there you are my dear  here hand me the nail gun  okay here you go  but do not point this at me because es mucho dangerioso  i know that my darling  you say that you know but seriously be very carefulio  you could morte me with this thing because it is realio as it gets  i love the improv the passion  not an improv  of course its real   as real as you cheating on me   with my sister serena   and getting her pregnant  shawn is the father of serenas baby  please put that down woman its loaded with real nails  and its you   that killed vincente  shawn watch out watch out  no  you are wrong  i am not a murderero  but i know who iso  yes your twin sister  i dont have a twin sister  yes what i mean is its someone who wants to be your twin sister  someone who wants to be you   i definitely did not write this  okay i dont get it  no its like eh  beautiful girls   drinking   beer on the beach   my god hes improvising   with homicide  i cant do this  uh you make a translation for me yeah  ah high school spanish comes back to haunt him  she did it  pan over pan over  after all that you just point at the murderer  dont you have any sense of dramatic tension or build  come on what are we on blossom no you start by saying she was your biggest fan  you know that she practically worships you she read all the scripts  i got this i got this you yes you  you hated it whenever corinne was put into jeopardy  so you took it up on yourself to avenge her  i had to  she cares too much  her heart is too big for her chest  when ernes to cheated on her she was too weak to stand up for herself  i needed to help her  she was like my best friend   i barely spoke to her  really  so it was you who replaced the retractable prop knife with the real one  and he deserved it  and it was also you who poisoned poor vincente after it was written that he betrayed corinne   but how  with a meat ball  usually i hunger for her meat balls the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum  but he wrote a suicide note  no he didnt  you should have a degree in being wrong all the time  and she almost got away with it  if it was not for the hairs   the hairs  yes the hairs  from the cheap imitation wig that you put on to emulate corinne when you committed these murders  yes i did it   and now its your turn to die  say what  for sleeping with serena when all corinne did was love you  shes right about that  easy you psycho put it down let go  hello  my name is   inspector carlton lassiter  i like cheese  really thats what you choose to say  i only took it for two years in junior high watch out  it had to be done  i will miss him  but you tried to kill him  yes but   ill love him the rest of my life
