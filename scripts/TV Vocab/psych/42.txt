                oh turn you round  ooh did you get me a piata  nope   pepsi challenge  nope  am i being executed  just a little experiment  you know its said that when youre deprived of one of your five senses  the other four compensate by becoming sharper  now i know i usually test you on what you can see  but today  i want you to tell me  what you can hear  ready  all right  tell me what you heard  well you went from the fridge to the stove  then you picked something up and threw it in the trash  excellent  take off your blindfold  hey my report  you threw it in the trash why  because it wasnt your report  i saw you get it from gus  now youre gonna do the report yourself  next thing i want to hear is the sound of that pencil moving across your paper  id rather be executed  its just stupid thats all  i mean if he didnt have any hair  no one had any business calling him fuzzy wuzzy  they were being ironic shawn  yeah but he wasnt fuzzy was he  no he wasnt  irony shawn  my point precisely  hey shawn  jules  what are you guys doing here  we were just out for a stroll  figured wed stop in for a social call  plus gus left his retainer in the break room  you came all the way down here in a torrential rainstorm for that  okay truth is we were bored  the storm knocked out our cable  gus wouldnt play boggle or cranium  i said i would play some cranium  the storm didnt knock out our cable  shawn didnt pay the bill  would have the storm would have knocked out our cable  you said it yourself  jules its torrential out there  the real reason were down here  is to pick up the check for our last case  so we can get our cable turned back on  the weather has dampened my psychic powers  but i am sensing that something big is about to come through that door  huge we just got a call from lassiter  he arrested ernesto ramos chavez 20 minutes ago  he is second in command of the cinco reyes  so he plays the big guitar in the mariachi band  no shawn cinco reyes  five kings  theyre one of the most dangerous gangs in our country  very good mr guster  lassiter busted him several years ago  but the d a couldnt make the charges stick  so he just dropped off the radar  but since then weve gotten hard evidence on chavez  that links him to a whole lotta nasty stuff  enough to put him away for good  lassiter did a great thing today  hey  hes here  come on dude this is way better than cable  i dont know  ultimately hes just another bad guy  book him  i got a tip from an informant that chavez had finally resurfaced  i tracked him to the quick shop  took a position at the front door  his only way out was through me  the clerk said itll take a few more minutes to process our check  do you mind  the man is telling his story  go ahead  so i walked up to him said good to see you again chavez  youre coming with me   he said just you  and i said just me   uh just to be clear  are we talking about the quick shop on las palmas or the one on princeton  whats the difference  well lets say for example that youd like a bag of funyuns  gonna have to go to the one on las palmas  princeton doesnt stock them  dont ask me why  i mean who doesnt love funyuns  it was the one on las palmas  but i had more important things on my mind than chips  well naturally you were apprehending a very dangerous  criminal from the cincos right   right  yeah reyes  but just so you know funyuns arent actually a chip   shawn enough with the funyuns  jules  they are an onionflavored corn snack  and for the record they are fun  but go on were being rude yeah  so how does it feel  you guys in the gang unit  couldnt catch chavez and lassiter did  yeah whatever  hey made our job easier   kudos lassiter  thanks drimmer  detective lassiter may i see you in my office  you bet  probably wants to give me a commendation or something  probably gonna make you a cop and a half  you deserve it carlton  hey i win we all win  detective id like to introduce agents whieldon and rupp  theyre from the fbi national gang task force  agents  good of you to be here  its been quite a night  we choppered right in when we heard about the arrest  ernesto chavez has been a highprofile target for a long time  its just a perfect storm of good timing  even better footwork  but you didnt have to travel all the way up here to congratulate me  we didnt were here for chavez  excuse me  we cut him a deal and he took it  hes gonna turn states witness  against the rest of the cinco reyes gang  youre just gonna let them take him  im sorry detective  but ernesto chavezs testimony  could have a profound effect  in dismantling a major criminal enterprise  i have not devoted countless manhours in pursuit of this scumbag  to have him comfortably live out his days  in some witness relocation program no way  detective i understand your frustration  he should be rotting in prison  but its not your call to make detective  so why dont you run along and fetch us our witness   why dont you kiss my  detective  combos different story  they are both pretzels and cheese  and if you get one without cheese  that means the bag is haunted  should have taken him out when i had the chance  whats that about  well i got it but get this  the desk sergeant says that all checks  must be endorsed by chief vick  relax buddy no reason to get all athwack  athwack thats not a word  its viennesium  thats not a language  chief pressing matter  oh not now spencer  all i need is a signature and a pen  either of you guys have a bic  montblanc paper mate  ill take a crayon  um agents whieldon and rupp our department psychic shawn spencer  very impressive work gentlemen  usually takes me 15 minutes to work lassiter up into that kind of lather  then i rinse and repeat  see guys im not the only one not paying bills   stop fight  stop fire  lassiter  www substeam tv presents  synch by safes  psych  so3e11 lassie did a bad bad thing   hes dead  damn it  get the coroner and forensics down here right away  what are you people staring at hes getting away  youre standing over a dead man with a gun in your hand   and  and id like to know  what the hell happened here  no time for that chief  our shooters still in the building  make time detective  i was escorting chavez out of his cell when the lights went off  i was accosted from behind i drew my weapon  i lost it in the scuffle  i heard a shot the lights came on chavez was dead  i just retrieved my weapon when you arrived on the scene  wow detective that storys a big load of crap  are you calling me a liar  oh you picking up on that genius  detective lassiter  hold me back  shawn will you get serious lassiter just shot a guy   dont be ridiculous  stand down  he didnt kill anyone his finger wasnt even on the trigger  stand down  all of you  chief i think its obvious what went down here  your detective just wasted my lead witness  and i would love to know what youre gonna do about it  detective lassiter says hes not the shooter then i believe him  are you kidding me  thank you chief  all right everybody listen up  theres a good chance our shooter is still in the building ohara you and i  ohara you and i would  ohara take three officers and search the lower floor  the rest of you i want this station locked down tight  every window and exit covered  every room and air duct searched  move  you you you with me  we are gonna follow protocol to the letter detective  now first i need to run ballistics on your weapon  right of course  i got it  now i need a full statement from you in writing  good luck finding a pen  all due respect chief i would be a lot more useful in the search  i wasnt asking  lets get outta here  this is creeping me out  hold on a second  hey where the hell are you going this is a crime scene  i was looking for the bathroom  is that not the bathroom  you know what never mind i can hold it  unless you wanna fork over one of those evidence bags  gimme a little privacy  out  okay  as far as we can tell no one has entered or exited the building since lockdown  okay weve done a complete search and we have alibis from all staff present  and  nothing  i think its time to have another talk with detective lassiter  dont you chief  detective  we need to go over some things  so i need you to tell me again exactly what happened  its all right here chief any word on the search  our shooter must have gotten through our net  we have got to expand our perimeter  carlton its not as simple as that  have a seat  ocampo  whats internal affairs doing here  detective lassiter  i understand youve been going through a difficult divorce  i also see that youve been putting in quite a lot of overtime lately  not to mention  you have a higher than normal incidence of discharging your weapon  and you were overheard saying you should have taken him out when you had the chance  are you saying i am actually a suspect  youve got to be kidding me  we just need to do a gun residue swab to make sure  that it wasnt you who fired the weapon  were just making sure  fine but i am telling you you are wasting your time   chief we need to speak  no we dont  the spirit world is abuzz and my psychic vibes indicate  nay  insist that lassiter did not shoot chavez  i mean we all knew that he would shoot somebody someday  oh so you think hes capable of it  no he doesnt  at most lassiter would plant evidence  would someone please get them the hell out of here  i couldnt agree more  dont worry buddy were all over this  look i believe lassiter is innocent too  but we need hard evidence to exonerate him  not visions or vibrations or whatever it is you have  chief those are but two of the arrows in my psychic quiver  you have to go by the book on this one chief   we understand  thank you  oh chief one more thing  you think you could sign this check for us  were a little bit brokeish  you think she went back inside to get a pen  im still not convinced shawn  how can you be absolutely certain that lassiter didnt shoot chavez  its relatively easy gus  i decided to be and therefore i am  socrates said that  no that was descartes  that was the cologne we wore in high school  that was drakkar noir  no that is a wine  thats pinot noir  hello  chief  welcome welcome to the fortress of solitude coffee  oh no no thank you no ive had enough  no more coffee  ive been up all night and we still havent found any physical evidence  that this mystery shooter ever existed and whats worse  ocampo got a hold of lassiters psychological profile  wow he really has it out for him  chief those psych evals are rarely accurate  it was probably done by some crackpot shrink with a fake swedish accent  it was the one done by your mother  sweet baby j  last night you said   that lassiter is innocent  he is   can you prove it  of course i can   oh you mean right now  yes now  ocampo has a warrant to search lassiters place  and hes headed over there right now and unless you  have something tangible i dont think i can stop this train  chief i think you can  i think you can i think you can  dont worry  ill divine something to get lassiter off the hook  lets go  its dedication  its creepy is what it is  the lab results just came in  i knew it  lassiters hand tested positive for gsr  well duh  lassiter always has gsr on his hands  he practically lives at the shooting range  think he wants to hang around here  ballistics says the bullet that killed chavez  definitely came from lassiters gun  all right  this may be a little tougher than i thought  not for me  chief  i didnt know youd be coming by today  i actually hadnt planned to but  oh no  detective lassiter you are the prime suspect  in the murder of ernesto ramon chavez  and as of this moment you are on suspension  please relinquish your badge  here  let me help you with this  thanks  i know you didnt do this buddy  and im gonna do everything i can to prove it  i promise  hot cheese  dude you know that cheese has gone bad  contraire mein herr its gone good very good  dont you know cheese is best when its aged  i read somewhere that a japanese business man  spent a fortune on a 200year old wheel of jarlsberg  i think youre confusing that with monets water lillies  no im pretty sure it was a jarlsberg  dont you people ever clean up in here  this place is a sty  lassie whats up  and the outfit man  what are you back on the job already  no these are my civvies  they look exactly like your work clothes  hardly  im wearing my suede bucks  theyre a casual gentlemans shoe  a casual gentlemans shoe  what are you the great gatsby  gonna do a little swan watching with daisy buchanan later  wow how did you come up with that one  eighth grade summer reading what  anyway were glad to see you  what are you doing here  well i wanted to tell you how much i appreciate you believing my innocence  especially considering how little i believe in you  and im starting my own investigation  and i want you on board   youre hiring us  absolutely not  then what are you doing  im giving you the chance to work with me  but we do that all the time  are you gonna help me or not  of course we are youre like our brother  mmm stepbrother  weird kid who lives down the street  and eats nothing but mayonnaise on saltines  please  have a seat  before we get started we always like to ask a few preliminary questions  standard stuff  fire away  okay well um lets see  one did you kill that guy   gus  what  guys this is kind of a timesensitive issue  if i dont clear my name in the next 24 hours  my chances become very slim  now i need to know your process how do we get started   you really wanna know my process  absolutely  usually starts with a holla and ends with a creamsicle  then if theres time in between  thundercats  ho  im dead  the d a is already hounding me for this report  i dont know how much longer i can hold her off  hounding you  when did that happen ocampo over drinks last night  look  all im saying is that this is a highly sensitive case  the sooner we clear it up the better for all of us  and im not signing off on anything until a thorough investigation is complete  as far as im concerned the pretty little d a can wait  whatever you say chief  chief can i talk to you for a second  i dont trust that guy  who ocampo neither do i hes a snake  exactly hes a politician  a guy like that will screw anyone for an indictment  and we cant let him do that to lassiter  detective im handling this  and meanwhile you have cases to work  chief hes here  send him in  look ohara youre distracted and i cant have that  so im assigning you a new partner  drimmer  hes one of the best detectives that ive got  and hes willing to help us out  look ohara i know this situation is weird  um all i can do is try to be as capable as your former partner was  lassiter is still my partner  absolutely  that didnt come out right  youre dismissed  lassie good news  we got you a grape one  told you i dont want a popsicle  oh well guess well have to share this  how do you share a popsicle  i take a lick you take a lick i take a lick you take a lick i take a lick  its yours  are those overnight bags  yeah had em in my trunk  youre staying here  my place is a crime scene its either here or im mucking with one of you two   heres fine  make yourself at home  excellent  now i have narrowed it down  to 31 known enemies of chavez  all people who wanted him dead  if we split the list three ways we can get this done a lot faster  our objective  is to a do a thorough workup of every suspect  and figure out who had access to the holding cell  its none of those guys  are you saying thats your method for all your investigations   not all of them  most of them  a great many of them yes  i am getting something though  you didnt tell me everything that happened that night  i told you everything i saw  when youre deprived of one of your five senses  the other four compensate by becoming sharper  close your eyes  uh yeah no can do  i never close my eyes with other people around  ever  what the hell are you doing   the hell are you doing  will you relax  hey what  sensory deprivation  you tell me what you saw  now tell me what you heard  right well obviously i heard the sound of my weapon going off  no thats not it something else  well  the only other thing i heard was  i heard a faint squeak  yahtzee thats it  thats our first lead  we go back to the cell  figure out what made that faint little squeak  and thatll lead us to our killer  i have to say  thats pretty impressive spencer   can i take this thing off now  yes you may  great lets get over there  that sounds like the horchata guy what  guster we kinda have other things on our plate right now  dont mind him hes out of his mind  thats clearly the frozen yogurt guy  lets do this  whoa whoa whoa whoa lassie where do you think youre going  im coming with you  buddy youre under investigation you cant go in there  just stay here well be back as soon as we can  jules  hey what are you guys doing here  oh i was guided here by the spirits and gus  the spirits told me that youre about to lead us down to the holding cells   gus just drove  absolutely not shawn  as you can see i am busy with another case  jules wheres your compassion  this is lassiter were talking about here  hes your comrade  dont you dare lecture me shawn  i am more upset about this than you could ever be  lassiter is my partner  how would you feel if something happened to gus  depends entirely on what happened to him  i mean if he wakes up one day and hes howard jones im like  dude things can only get better   he wins the u s open  im openly weeping in the front row of the players box  between his mom and his dad  if he leaves the cake out in the rain  look the chief is on top of this  shes making sure that every piece of evidence is analyzed  and every person is questioned  even the guy that was passed out in the holding cell the other night  wait a second there was someone else down there  yeah somebody named kenneth loggins  kenny loggins is in jail  the composer of house at pooh corner  and this is it has fallen on hard times  no not that kenny loggins  this guy is a petty thief and a drunk  we picked him up for vagrancy outside of tom blairs pub  he was released this morning  did he see anything that can help us  or more importantly  did he hear anything  no like i said he was passed out  now i have to go drimmer is waiting for me  drimmer  big goofy dude from upstairs youre working with him now  its only temporary  just till lassiter gets reinstated  looks like its stealth mode for us partner  stealth mode  hit the jackal switch  what is she doing with drimmer  oh my god  shes already been assigned a new partner  wait do you know where were going  i have no idea  and hes letting her drive  lets just get in and out before someone catches us  someone like me  i may yell for the guard unless you do what i want  what do you want  a friendly ear   gus thats you  im not giving him my ear  just talk to him but dont  dont get too close cause im not actually sure  he doesnt want one of your ears  you talk to him   will you just go and talk to him  why do i gotta talk to him  because i gotta walk around here   you want to talk with him  no im not gonna talk this guy   talk with him  im not gonna talk this guy  so what line of work you in  sales  inside or outside  its outside sales  any idea what territory you service  central coast mostly  why dont you just go back to the job you had before  i was a life coach  you were a life coach  i heard a faint squeak  dude i got it lets go  did you know that before he stabbed a guy he was a life coach  who would hire him as a life coach  the guy he stabbed  yeah we need to get out of here  if what youre saying is right  and kenny loggins saw the murder go down  why would he lie to the cops and say he didnt see anything  because what he saw or more importantly  who he saw scared the hell out of him  so kenny loggins knows who the real killer is  which means were headed to his favorite dive  tom blaires pub  if he wouldnt tell the cops  why do you think he would tell us  i have ways gus  you dont have any ways do you  i have curds and wheys  its kenny loggins  hes dead  so youre saying hes not all right  lassi  whats up you totally abandoned us  whered you go  walking  walking where  round  and youre not answering your phone  nothing to say  dude is that my shirt  oh yeah i  i spilled tapioca on mine  tapioca my tapioca  the one with the light dusting of cinnamon on top   that was in the fridge  yeah   my mom made that  gus simmer down  lassi whats going on here  well lets see  my partners moved on  my careers in shambles and even sweet lady justice has abandoned me  bitch  look youre not done yet  there was someone else down there  yeah kenny loggins he was passed out  no no no no he wasnt passed out  and and i sense that he saw everything and someone  killed him because of it and that someone  wasnt you   it wasnt you was it  dude  im just saying hes the one who disappeared from the car  this is a huge development  it is youre right  the one person who can get me off the hook  is now dead  thank you spencer  hes seriously depressed hes going all bukowski on us  i dont think we can leave him alone  what do we do with him  all right look  i dont think lassiter killed chavez any more than you two do  but it doesnt mean i want him camped out in my house  for the record im only  gus what  thats up from yesterday  dad look the mans clearly in a bad place  we just need you to keep an eye on him for a little while  yeah right  hes in my kitchen breaking my onlyidrink fromthecarton rule  he is a fellow cop in need of help  isnt that reason enough  one day one day no more  thank you  all right now is this where the youaskfor myadvice part comes in  what no dad please  all right look check it out  we know that the real killer had access to the holding cells  and knew how to shut off the power  all right well so the janitor killed him  no  dad i think this was an inside job  you stop right there shawn  you do not throw accusations like that around   do you understand  think about it  kenny loggins saw the shooter but was too afraid to i d him  now who would he fear most  kenny loggins was in the next cell  wh was jim messina in there with him   whos jim messina  a different kenny loggins  listen to me  under no circumstances do you go into that police station  and snoop around and put yourself at risk  do you understand  yeah  look me in the eyes and say it  i promise  good  now hurry up  what were you raised by wolves   lets go  where we heading  police station  you just told your dad you wouldnt go there  how long have you known me  now what exactly are we looking for  anything that connects kenny loggins to someone in the department  thats weird  what do you got  im in the arrest database  and theres no record of a kenny loggins  the drunkard or the gifted musician  that doesnt make any sense  jules said he was a chronic offender  these are the hard copies of every arrest in the last year  he should definitely be in here  dude this thing goes from page 29 to page 32  theres two pages missing  somebody mustve taken it out  oh man now my fingers are all smudgy   why do i even bother with manipedis  dude  i think somebodys here  act natural  what the hell are you doing  it was the strangest thing jules  im having psychic spasms  i believe the origin of these spasms is coming from inside the records room  oh oh thats a biggie  i am sensing that there is something missing in here  something to do with kenny loggins  the criminal not the man with fabulous hair  what are you talking about  oh theres another one  oh this is from the hips  this is some serious business  here look at this log book  and im sensing that all the records of his arrest are gone  these pages have been stolen  what  what  what is it what are you getting  i was thinking of foot loose  when the shewelder dances over the chair and the water was cascading down  that was flash dance  that was awesome is what it was  oh my god   what what is it  i saw ocampo go in this office earlier  he was shredding papers   the al guy  yeah it makes perfect sense  he has bigtime political ambitions  and taking down a highranking police officer  would be a huge career boost for him  the shredders been emptied  i think the janitor is still here  come on lets go  ill get it ill get it ill get it thats dirty  its impossible to tell anything from these  not after theyre all taped back up together again  tell me youre kidding  i dont joke around about meticulously reassembling shredded documents gus  this will be fun come on like doing a puzzle  except instead of revealing a shipwreck or a kitten  well get our proof that ocampo is the killer  ill stay here and try to trace any logon ocampo made to the database  someones coming  ohara  i finished up that paperwork for both of us  so im going to take off for the day  see you around  partner   partner  thats cold juliet  no he is not my partner  he just thinks that he is my partner  hes paid for coffee brought me cupcakes  but trust me my mind is 100 focused on lassiter just like you  you guys are thinking about cupcakes arent you   yes  yes  theyre not on her desk  are you going to help out or what  oh gus im still cramping man  its my fault i shouldve hydrated  take it anymore i cannot spend one more minute with lassiter  he is driving me outta my mind   what is this  nothing  just uh   you know  paper  you went down to the police station didnt you  i told you very specifically  do not go down there and poke your nose around  my nose is not to blame my feet took me there  along with gus but listen we struck gold  in these shreddings is the answer to who killed kenny loggins  we could use an extra set of hands  im outta commission my knuckles are swelling  you said it was cramping  the pain is criminal gus  what do you say dad  help us out or back to lassie  that bad huh  cant take it anymore hes eaten everything in my house he  hes recording every episode of cops   you love cops  not 25 times a day  its got me nostalgic for the times that you were living at home  its nauseating  thanks dad  peanut guy  you two keep at it  and ill be back before you can say i heart legumes   youre really good at this  its hereditary  i come from a long line of puzzlers gus  shawn is terrible at puzzles  skips a generation  and theres a little something extra for you  yeah  hey shawn   drimmer  out for my nightly jog  gotta work off those cupcakes  right  well  good luck with that  hey listen i was wondering something  are you a  are you and ohara  you know an item  cause she seems to talk about you an awful lot  really  what is he doing out there hes got the nuts already  bring em in  does this say versa bank  this is a credit card bill  yep so much for shawns theory  is that all hes paying for cable  im getting robbed  thats fascinating what else what else did she say  well that youre very witty and urbane  im sure  and also that youre really gifted  this psychic stuff really uh brings results  so first thing i gotta know is  am i gonna win the lottery   no  im not  i dont know  im not im not  i didnt think i was anyway so  no but more importantly  you getting anything on this lassiter business  oh man now my fingers are all smudgy  youre getting something arent you  no  no all i got is a couple of dudes in the office jonesing for peanuts  one of ems part elephant  he never lets me forget that  well i guess you better get back to them  yeah good talk drimmer all right  hey shawn one more thing  yeah  that was a cheap shot drimmer  one minute were standing there  chatting about your creepy infatuation with jules  and the next im laying on this uncomfortable couch  in lassies place no less my god could this get any worse  i guess it can  shut up spencer  you might be able to smartass your way outta some things  but you know what i dont see that happening here  oh so youre the psychic now  shut up  i like the sound of my own voice  i wont apologize for that  besides i should thank you for coldcocking me  you managed to shake my psychic juju loose  one second  okay  it was you chavez looked at when lassiter brought him in  because in all your years on the gang unit  the two of you became quite the bffs  you never brought chavez in and you never intended to  because you were on his payroll  now how does it feel  you guys in the gang unit couldnt catch chavez  but lassiter did  yeah whatever  hey made our job easier  kudos lassiter  once you found out he was turning states witness  you knew it was only a matter of time  before he pointed the finger at you  so you had to take him out  poor kenny loggins well he was just collateral damage  one might even say  he was in the danger zone  oh come on drimmer  that at least merited a microchuckle  you really think killing me is gonna solve your problems  oh im not gonna kill ya   bad boys bad boys  what you gonna do    what you gonna do  when they come for you   break in the case meet me at your apartment  spencer  juliet  detective ohara   have you seen shawn  no   hes missing  no he isnt exactly missing  he hasnt been gone 24 hours  gus is a little panicky  where did you last see him  he was last outside our office talking with your new partner  whats his name cupcake guy  drimmer thats weird  he told me he was driving to santa paula to visit his mother  spencer get your feet off my table  how the helld you get in my place  drimmer  i cant believe you thought that text was actually from me  it lacked all nuance my signature mocking tone  and was utterly devoid of emoticons  why  because hes in business with cinco reyes  and when you brought in chavez business hours were over sweetheart  i just became kojak  i always knew there was something off about you drimmer  but i didnt figure you for dirty  you are one lowlife scumsuckin bastard arent you  i know how this works lassiter  trying to throw me off with one of your stupid little insults  well fellas  might as well get on with it  whats that  thats your suicide note  it explains how spencer psychically figured out that it was you  i believe the term youre looking for is divined   spencer divined  it was you who killed chavez and loggins  and he was gonna go to the chief with it  so you shot him  you two being former lovers and all you were overwhelmed with guilt  former lovers really  called misinformation hes hoping they wont look too closely  you are one sick twist drimmer  i know  whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait just wait  im getting something im sensing something  something wild  uh something in the way you look tonight  deep blue something  do you
