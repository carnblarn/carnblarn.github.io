                  shawn  what are you doing home from school  uh  uh well  at the assembly today there was a guy  and he hypnotized some students  and one of them thought he was a kangaroo  and he punched the guy  and he passed out before he could put the kids back to normal  uh but luckily  mr detmer an exnavy seal  put everyone back before six kids had to go to the hospital  let me see the suspension note from the teacher  how did you know  kid i got a nickname at work its the human lie detector  i spend my day analyzing lies and the people who tell them  rule number one  every lie is built on a kernel of truth  take your little fib for instance  if i were to put money on it  id say the only true thing that you just said is that  mr detmer is exnavy seal  youre right thats amazing  not really  the relative specificity of that statement compared to the others made it obvious  look shawn  if you continue to lie like this  nobodys gonna believe you when it counts  and that could put your life on the line  like maybe when i might be a cop  no like now  shawn spencer thrives on clutch moments like this  its just him the ball and the hole  surrounded by silence  and a man wearing a hefty bag on angel dust  come on dude i was in the zone  now i have to start all over  shawn the floor is flat  i dont know why you cant just putt in our office  because gus anyone can hit a ball into an empty cup  the true challenge is to guide the ball almost magically  through the organized chaos of human bustle  and into the hole as if no one were there  lets just hope it works better  than when you attempted the same thing with the darts  pardon me i nailed that   no you hit a guys eye  shh  dude  stay alive  get there  oh  how about my phone call   youll get your phone call  i didnt do it you have to believe me  oh   who put a putting green in here  he was already dead  i was trying to resuscitate him  wait wait that guy  the one with the great hair he can vouch for me  i think we worked at busch gardens together one summer  yeah we made funnel cakes  oh look at that gus  he mustve gotten me confused with another man with great hair  and the white guy   i know him too  save it ryan   hey rember  just shut up  uh jules   whats the story there  yeah  thats ryan bainsworth  or lyin ryan as we call him around here  hes a compulsive liar who is notorious for calling in tips  and sending the department on wild goose chases  hes pretty much an embarrassment to all of us  how can you tell that someones a compulsive liar  i mean assuming that their pants arent on fire  trust me we know  oh come on jules  we all tend to bend the truth just a little  not me   oh really  mmmm  does this ring a bell  no shawn i have not had any naughty dreams about you  and  yes shawn  i do wish gus was never born so that i could be your partner   what  true story   thats messed up  i never said that gus  anyway ryan usually comes in claiming to be a witness to a crime  but this time looks like hes committed one  oh detective ohara  this is dr morey the das psychological expert  nice to meet you heres the file on our suspect  thank you very much  dont mind them  theyre just here to observe  shes right please carry on  but when youre finished  id appreciate if you evaluate my partner gus  for years hes been claiming to be insane in the membrane  all right why dont you just do us all a favor  and write down in neat little letters all about  how you stabbed and murdered your super in cold blood  for the last time im innocent  i had asked my super to fix the garbage disposal  i clogged it with cinnamon sticks and lemon wedges from a marinade  afterwards he was to check my pipes because the polarity is completely off  and the water drains counterclockwise  but by the time i got home i found him there  dead  doctor if i can speak for you  id rather you didnt  look all things being equal  id rather be scrapbooking right now  but thats thats not important  though i have been known to make a kickass collage  then maybe youd like to tell me who did kill him   yes an assassin  an assassin  a hired assassin no two of them actually  yes you see that has to be it  the night before i went to this restaurant  to get a basket of these things called fries quatro queso dos fritos  you know the ones where they inject potatoes with the four cheese mixture  fry them three quarters of the way  pull them out batter them fry them again  and then serve them with bacon and an ancho chile sour cream  anyway as i was sitting there  a car speeds right through the storefront across the street  it makes such a loud noise i had to turn my head and look  and that is when i overheard the guy with the curlyqs on his face  tell the other guy at the corner table about the assassination plot   can it be true  no way  i mean i is it even possible  i couldnt imagine  theres no way you could prepare a fry like that  thatd be way too much for the for the human palate to manage  it would be a flavor seizure  gentlemen please dont be ridiculous  shes right  lets just take a minute here to think things through   they must be parboiling the potato first  an assassination plot  seriously how gullible do you think we are  you have to believe me im 100 sure on this  i clearly heard one of them say  that they were gonna kill someone with his belt buckle  ryan come on  they mustve known that i overheard them  thats why they were trying to kill me  but they surprised the super in my apartment got him instead  and and he tried to stop them they killed him  how did they know where to find you huh  because i was looking for them  i was asking around putting up fliers  oh fliers  oh well that makes sense then you advertised for killers  you have to believe me  these are the guys that you want  if you dont catch them someone else is gonna die i swear to you  i have a question   no  its not a yes or no question  what is the name of the restaurant that serves these alleged fries  and might i substitute a garlic lemon aioli  spencer out  officer  if it helps any  i think substitutions are allowed   so what do you think dr morey  well  he shows all the classic signs of an underlying pathology  people like this lie in order to make themselves valuable  over time when people stop believing their lies  theyre forced to escalate their behavior in order to reclaim the attention  could he escalate it to the point of murder   my professional opinion  please  his police history  and the circumstantial evidence of his fingerprints on the murder weapon  and the victims blood on his hands  mm yes i think that should be enough to prosecute him   well thats too bad  why  because lyin ryan is telling the truth this time  well     and youre sure you want to take one the sbpd  an expert in forensic psychology and the das office  because they all believe hes guilty  i certainly want to investigate further  every good liars lies are rooted in a kernel of truth  this isnt even our case  are you trying to show up the police department  is this about pride  gus i got these jeans at a garage  not a garage sale a garage  clearly pride is not an issue for me  this is about me not wanting a man to be wrongfully convicted  because he has a sickness that he cannot control  plus he appreciated my hair  no he appreciated my hair  he was lying  hes a compulsive liar thats what they do  come on try to play catch up  uh why dont you play investigate this on your own  fine  stay here wash the dishes in those ridiculous gloves  im going to the restaurant that he said had cheeseinfused  twicebattered fries  ill drive  the fries exist shawn  he was telling the truth in a big way  theyre like a pyramid of savory goodness  lets just sit here and look at them for awhile  dude this feels like a family establishment doesnt it  im not sure two ruthless hired gunmen would frequent a place like  a car speeds right through the storefront window across the street  that made me turn my head  this  uh scuse us   uhhuh  do you rember  if there were two threateninglooking guys sitting at that table in the corner yesterday  oh my gosh yes   howd you know that  hes psychic  oh oh   do you do parties  private ones yes  are you thinking of throwing a little something together for yourself  oh no my niece shes turning six  not available for that  uh do you by chance remember overhearing anything they said  no the only thing they said to me was when they ordered  a beer and a cup of hot water with cinnamon sticks and lemon wedges  i clogged it with cinnamon sticks and lemon wedges from a marinade  but they were totally creepy  scared the heck out of the hostess  yeah i saw those guys  definitely very creepy  the one with the weird handlebar mustache  that is when i overheard the guy with the curlyqs on his face   handlebar mustache  like the hamburglar  no no no that was mayor mccheese  he had the stache burglar had the mask  right right right  then there was grimace that brother was funny   what  no no no no excuse us   i gave you vin diesel  gave me  youre not claiming grimace is a brother  grimace is a brother  hes an amorphous mass hes like a big amoeba   hes a black amoeba shawn  purple  anyway  when i seated them  i saw a bulge under his suit jacket  like from a gun on his belt  they were gonna kill someone with his belt buckle  i think im starting to understand how ryan works  when people stop believing their lies  theyre forced to escalate their behavior in order to reclaim the attention  sorry anything else  no but you guys should talk to carl the valet  he had a really weird story  thank you  what color was grimace   what  black  yeah those creepy dudes  they were talking a lot about money or somethin  then one of them slips the other one a bag of cash  but then they give me a 50 tip  you know it really pisses me off  when folks are too cheap to even shell out for a dollar  i hear that  take care of yourself  mr spencer mr guster  what are you doing here   well chief if you must know  i must  we are going to speak with ryan  because the psychic bone in this finger  is telling me that he is not lying about the hit men  which means he may also be telling the truth about the assassination plot  and if we dont follow up on it even though it seems pretty thin   someone could die  what  ha i will i will tell her that because its spot on  chief that is a very smart pantsuit  im not having a conversation with your pinky  okay one last question  loehmanns or talbots  even if i did believe you which i dont  i have been down this road with ryan too many times  now unless you have some concrete proof of something  you and your pinky are banned from wasting  any department resources on any information coming from ryan bainsworth  fair enough  we will find you something concrete  thank you  good news we have an ingenious plan  ingenious  huh  so maybe youd like to turn and face another direction  preferably away from ryans holding cell  youre not speaking to him this is not a case for you  go home   oh us  oh  we should we go home  thank you  no no you didnt do anything  its not your fault  his name was grimace jackson shawn  grimace t jackson   youre ridiculous  whatever  how are we gonna get into ryans apartment to check it out  follow my lead   hiya  hello  may i help you  perhaps my name is shawn spencer  im with the big uncles of america program  this is my underprivileged mentee hollaback atcha  hes selling magazine subscriptions as a way to learn business skills  otherwise hed be forced to join a gang if he was still on the streets  if iwerestill out on the street id be an og  you wish  okay just dont tell anyone i let you in  oh thank you very much  now what exactly are we looking for  evidence  evidence to corroborate the story  check it out  look at the way the bloods sprayed along the wall   just look  what  the aortic spatter  sure it means that the supers aortic artery was punctured during the murder   the builtup blood pressure causes different  wow  some of us like to be prepared shawn  no no  when ryan came into the station he only had blood on his hands  if hed killed the super wouldnt it have sprayed all over his clothes too  oh no  oh my gosh ah  that means the super was in the wrong place at the really really wrong time  the assassins took him out thinking he was ryan  howd they know where to find you huh  because i was looking for them  i was asking around putting up fliers  that means ryans telling the truth  which also means that  theres someone else out there with a target on their back  gus look  ryan really did work at busch gardens  is that what he thinks good hair looks like  i think thats koko b ware  shawn come on  look hes letting ryan shoulder the parrot  where we gonna find these socalled assassins  mmhmmmm  but ryans the only one that can help us find them  even if they did exist  the chief was emphatic when she said she does not want us talking to ryan  while hes in police custody   bingo  dont say bingo   cranium  now ill play some cranium  how much do we have in the psych savings account  i really hate when you ask that question  thank you very much  what are you doing here  dapper dan  were just gonna pay a visit to our old buddy ryan  you were given direct orders to stay away from him   yeah we dont take orders well  no  unless theyre to get on the dance floor   or raise the roof  make some noize with a z  you know what just forget i asked okay  what is it first day with the new feet  he spent all day in court waiting to testify in a case  and the defense attorney didnt show up again  but hes right  you guys cant communicate with ryan while hes in custody  i guess its a good thing hes no longer in custody  seeing as how we just posted his bail  looks like paper actually our life savings  byebye  hey you guys want lunch  you know i own a restaurant downtown  actually its not all mine i coown it with mike ditka  you guys eat wild game dont ya  once we find the real killers the police will believe us  us what us  im not convinced you didnt kill that dude  blood splatter is a subjective science  it was the assassins im telling you  and if we dont stop em theyre gonna kill again  i think ryan has a point is there a kinkos nearby  we should make some new fliers   what information do you actually have  well ii dont know if its enough  but i did overhear a time a place and a name  come again  i know who what and where  ryan that thats everything we need to know thats all of it  why didnt you just say that in the first place  because no one would let me  thats true gus thats very true  yeah i got that shawn just go ahead ryan   the time was 1000  1000  to 430   1000 to 430  yeah  a sixhour window  what do your killers work at the cable company  its okay whats the place    i didnt get a street name or an apartment number  but the address definitely has a 420 in it  hmm  but the name i have  perfect what is it   tom  tom  you wouldnt happen to have a last name would you  come on guys i cant do everything for you  oh im teaching a water aerobics class in 20 minutes  i i gotta go  go we just bailed you out of jail  ryan its okay  i trust you do your thing  well let you know when we have something  perfect i will have one of my assistants track me down wherever i am  count on it  okay but  dont worry gus  well travel faster without him   all right fine  every liar has a tell   so what  sure hes good  but if you listen its there   all right will you  step back into the office   will you stop  of course were gonna stop for tacos on the way  thank you  im sorry what time do you close  well if youre closed already why are you answering the phone  dude the clock is ticking on some guys life  and youre out getting a milkshake  gus dont be this crevice in my arm  this isnt a milkshake its a smoothie  theres a huge difference  and i was goin around the neighborhood  checkin all the places that are open from 1000 to 430  and by blind luck  one of them just happened to be the only juice bar in santa barbara  that offers blueberries in the mist with acai and goji berries  i didnt order that this is the normal blueberries in the mist  how did you do  i got a list of all the addresses in santa barbara that begin with 420  there are over 700 possibilities shawn    you get the drift  wow  i guess next well have to comb through apartments and suites too  what are you doing  im sorry shawn  but i never fully believed ryan in the first place  i was goin along with your gut as usual  and i have a nonnegotiable distance limit on those trips  i have a real job  well uh  are you telling me you would rather sell pharmaceuticals  than foil an assassination plot  and clear an innocent man thats been accused of murder  innocent man we just took on the worlds most unreliable client  i get the feeling im gonna need all the commissions i can get  ill be spendin the next six weeks praying he doesnt skip out on his hearing  so we can get our bail money back  you can get bail money back  well what am i supposed to do  i dont know call the human lie detector  okay  ryan just uh  just tell him exactly what you told the police  oh i killed the super of my building  what  thats not thats not true at all  well the santa barbara police department seems to think its true  otherwise why did they arrest me  shawn if this guy says that hes guilty what the hell am i doing here  hes lying  wait hes lying about lying  yes no i  ryan ryan  tell him about the assassins the creepy assassins  with the handlebar mustache and the plot and the  and the counterclockwise water please  assassins  counterclockwise water really  shawn if i said that  i would sound crazy  dude youarecrazy  youre youre way off the reservation thats why im trying to keep you out of jail  when you lie does that make you feel important  because if you keep lying the way you do  no one will believe you when it counts  i will slap you in the face  oh violence is not the answer  i would say that you are the second most sane person in this room  ryan would you excuse us for just a minute  oh yeah  dont wander off  all right shawn  why are you workin so hard on this one  i work hard on all my cases  ii know you do you work hard to have fun to show off  look im not an idiot  i know this guys got a screw loose hes lying out his ass  what i dont understand is why youre taking this one so seriously  i guess because nobody including the police  believes in him   i know whats going on here  oh really  yes i do shawn listen to me  you are not ryan  yeah you stretch the truth a little bit sometimes  at least you know where the line is   of course i know where the line is  but only because of two things  one you always had somebody around who knew when you were lying and bothered to call you on it   whats the second thing  well id like to say that  you always had enough natural talent to fall back on  but id be lying  listen to me kid if you ever drag my ass down here again to do gusters job  im gonna hit you up with a consulting fee  okay good night captain  what was that  that was me saving your life  from my dad  we dont know who we can trust  weve gotta stay low  lowi have a face guy who can disguise us  get us out of the country if need be hes  yeah hes probably gonna have to break your nose  but remember this is what you signed up for   stop it  what  this is real  your life is in danger okay  even batman takes off the cape and the cowl  when hes in the bat cave with alfred so just  pretend like im alfred  and you be ryan  wayne  ah its them its them dont get it   hold on  dont   hello  shawn  i cant believe im making this call  but i figured it out  im standing at 420 main street and guess what it is  a hospital  spencer what the hell  are you all right  yeah of course i am why  well we got the message that you were at the hospital  something about life and death  oh right that well we are in a hospital  and as it happens its filled with both life and death  i knew i shouldve left that message  whats going on spencer  ryan and i spent some quality time in a psychic sweat lodge   toweled  fully  and i have had a clear vision of the absolute truth  the target of the assassination is right down the hall  his name is tom tom lieber  and he needs police protection  this more of your bull crap bainsworth because in addition to your murder charge  im pretty sure we have enough to charge you with reckless disregard of police resources   you too as well  more than enough grounds  wait no you have to believe us  youre killing me youre killing me  freeze  perfect timing im dead  thanks a lot  you  out  no no no i dont want to hear it anymore  get out  spencer thank you once again for completely wasting my time  once again just last week i gave you the tip about the twice yearly sale at tj maxx  racks and racks of 7 ties  wasting your time i dont think so  whats goin on is this about the accident  because i still dont remember it  what accident  i hit a car  you mean you were hit by a car  no i hit one  or at least thats what they told me i dont remember any of it  why would i even want to hit a buick  i dont have anything against buicks  carlton look at this  sir are you suffering from amnesia  yeah maybe i think  or something like that  great leave it to lyin ryan to find the only amnesiac in santa barbara  although i wont be the only amnesia person much longer  im getting my memory back   a little bit each day  look lieber  tom i never forgot that  how wonderful for you  we think you may be in grave danger   no we dont  yes we do  this side of the room the cool side  sorry jules think that  someone may be trying to kill you  are you blackmailing anyone  are you having a torrid affair  are you are you part of treadstone  wait  dont answer the last question  oh wow no no i i work from home  receiving and processing complaints for a mattress manufacturer  on tuesdays i go out and get new games  maybe throw in a trip to 711 for a grape slurpee  which must have been where i was going  oh just after 600  anapamu street  i wouldve been there right after the   what  my games  all over the street  how great would those have been during my convalescence  okay this is fascinating spencer makebelieve times over  we got real police work to do by the way  youre still a long ways off from connecting anyone other than ryan to the murder of that super  hey chief what do ya got  shawn what are we doing  ryan lied to us again  he made us look like fools again  and now were standing in a room with a guy who literally knows nothing   no offense tom  no none taken  visiting hours ended hours ago  you gentlemen need to finish your business now  oh our business is definitely finished trust me  tom i do hope you remember stuff  yeah no no youve got it  well be there in ten  i certainly hope you didnt make dinner reservations at soup plantation  gus and i have already eaten  though i suppose we could go around the corner and watch you eat if youd like  they just found a body in a vacant office suite on the corner of gardener and carrillo  really any id  youre not gonna believe this it is the defense attorney on the case ive been trying to give testimony on all week  huh what about ryans assassins  you should call either the loch ness monster or bigfoot if you get in trouble  im sure theyd be happy to help  first of all bigfoot and i havent spoken in five years  six if you dont count his cousins wedding which was literally like hey b  come on jules  you know me and i know people i can read them you know that  ive spent enough time with ryan to know when hes lying and when hes telling the truth  and there is a kernel of truth in every one of his stories  so they cannot be dismissed  neither can he hes a person  a person is more than the tales that they tell  yeah well right now hes more than just a person  hes a doctor  you know they say we doctors have a god complex  but after seven years of neurosurgery  i say we have a complex god  look on the bright side spencer  you keep up this losing streak you will become completely useless to the department  i know we havent eaten  shawn we are treading on thin ice right now  yes but im about to do a double axel into a salchow and finish with a sweet little camel toe   you mean camel spin  ive heard it both ways im right about the ryan thing  no you are obsessed with this ryan thing  and dude if your psychic powers disappear  vick wont need to hire us anymore  theres no way we can subsist on the private jobs we get  how many times must we go through this  i am this close to getting on the pro bowlers tour   i am not doing this  okay i get it  we have to make nice with the chief  why do you think i brought along this peace offering  you really think that one container of fries quatro quesos dos fritos is gonna fix everything  yes i do  the lawyer had two slugs in his chest  ballistics is checking the system for matches   any trace  nothing yet the labs gonna call the second they find anything  oh not now gentlemen  we are in the middle of a homicide investigation  and dont think i dont know that youve been wasting my detectives time  chasing leads once again supplied by ryan bainsworth  chief chief vick  hmm  chief karen charles vick  here  ooh  its a fries quatro quesos dos fritos  and apparently doesnt travel well  the point is  we are sorry for making lassiter and juliet run around town on wild goose chases  shawns psychic powers have been a tad on the fritz  the good news is they are back to 100 working order  and we are fully available to help on this murder case you are now on  even more good news those taste better than they look  yes they do  yeah fine apology accepted  and my middle name is not charles  i took a shot i knew it was a c  now about this defense attorneys murder case  any victim of an assassination plot   wow really  as odd as it sounds  it actually did cross my mind  so i checked it out and i can say with certainty that he is not  the victim of mr bainsworths assassination plot  the coroner puts time of death at four days ago  and a recently discovered witness who heard shots at 600 that evening confirms it  which means the lawyer was killed before ryan allegedly overheard these men planning a hit  our victim wouldve already been dead at that point no need to kill him again  unless he was a zombie   chief  yes  the surveillance video from the back door of the garage near the scene of the crime came in  its corrupted theres not much of it  hey are those the fries quatro queso  yes they are  hmm they dont travel well  ohara set it up  lets take a look  wait dude  she said the lawyer died four days ago  yes its over shawn  four days ago was tuesday  that means the lawyer got killed in a building on gardener street  on the same day that lieber got hit by a car on anapamu  not just the same day the same time around 600 pm  and those streets are only two blocks away  ryan the lawyer lieber theyre all connected somehow  come on  fries  sorry to interrupt i just got a very strong vibe that youre about to apologize to us  in what world would we ever apologize to you  waynes maybe daves its a small   spencer  i believe this dvd will prove that ryan and i have been right all along  now whos that  ohara rewind that  no way  thats tom lieber  thats the kid that bainsworth led us to at the hospital chief  and hes running away from where the body was found  well i guess you were right mr spencer  lieber mustve killed the lawyer and then got hit by the car as he fled the scene  ooh uh i dont know the spirits are a little cloudy on that part chief  im sorry for the spirits but we dont have time for gray areas  detectives i want you to get to that hospital right now  from what i understand lieber is regaing his memory  and the second he remembers what he did he could run   come on lets go  got it  she knows shes not gonna eat that   what  i dont think liebers the killer  i saw something on the tape hold on  there right there  he stops and looks back over his shoulder why  because someone is chasing him  two creepy someones to be exact  lieber didnt kill the lawyer but he saw who did  ryans assassins they chased him into traffic and they thought that was the end of it  but then the newspaper reports that he survived  goes into a coma wakes up with amnesia  the killers think they still have a window  but todays paper said hes regaining his memory  so ryan overheard the real killers plotting to take out lieber  we have got to get back to the hospital  and tell lassie and jules that these guys are comin back to clean up their own mess  come on    yeah dobson i need an apb out on a thomas lieber  hes wanted for questioning in a murder  get his picture from the dmv   wheres lieber  gone looks like hes on the lam  hes on a lamb he wont get far  alpaca different story those things really fly  you two dont need to be here  its not true lassie lieber didnt kill the lawyer  he witnessed ryans assassins do the deed and now theyve clearly come back to get him  and i promise i will ask all about your insane little theories once i put them both in jail  come on gus lets find tom  i shouldve been on to this way earlier  i cant believe i didnt make the connection  we dont know that liebers dead shawn maybe he rembered and left before the killers could find him   hey guys  theyre right behind us theyre gonna kill us  drive drive   okay enough with the seatbelts  just lets go  just drive theyre right behind us  whered you learn to drive   all right now  wanna keep this upright  im sorry  i had to take matters into my own hands i snuck lieber out the ambulance bay  and when i saw you guys pull up i knew we could hide in the car  incoming  so wait you just took him out of the hospital  well i had to act quickly  tom started to rember everything  well not everything really yet  and the killers the killers were already in the building  it was like a game of cat and mouse trying to get out of there unseen   didnt we just use the elevator  would you please let me tell the story  parking hes parking hes parking  very nice partner you just weaved your way through those obstacles  like a ferret on roller skates  hey what are you doing  why are we slowing down  no no no  gus  what what what what are you doing  dude the killers are right behind us  nobodys following us shawn and there never was  the only thing i know for sure right now is that we are harboring two fugitives  okay gus look i believe ryan  but ii understand why you dont  ive maxed you out in the blind faith department  and thats fair so you dont have to believe him  just keep believing in me  come on buddy  whoa  thats them  thats them  thats the guys from the restaurant  its comin back to me  they

no more lies  i am quittin cold turkey turnin over a new leaf  really   no more lyin ryan  no  just like you said i am gonna be just ryan  if you hadnt believed me  an innocent person would have ended up dead  and all because i became a guy who couldnt be taken at his word  so i just wanted to come here to thank you before i took off  well if its any consolation i believed you from the very beginning  especially since you recognized i have great hair   i was talking about him  you were lying  its okay i forgive you  im comin around  so where are you off to  this is unbelievable  i got
