these words  proudly ive never heard of any of these words  i file these words under things to say  when i want to be ridiculed or kicked out of bed   see the problem is that  butyraceous  is clearly a round one word  oh god stop talking  id like to pretend we still have things in common gus  well instead of sitting here maybe we should get to work  try not to break anything  so this is what it looks like  what  the comfort room  this is where you go to deal with missing a word  oh yeah  where do they take you to deal with  missing your entire childhood  shawn this misplaced malevolence you have  with the spelling bee is getting monotonous  stop hating on the bee  im sorry maam  i do apologize for his inappropriate virulence  why are you using all these bigass words all of a sudden  im not doing that  thats preposterous  i was in the spelling bee myself  i almost won  are you still on that  of course im still on it  i knew it wasnt o  you may have five minutes with each contestant

been  peppered with controversy  it certainly has well hes been watching  from a private box on the balcony  but now hes going to come out so that we can see him  this could be something big bud  i think hes having difficulty breathing  he does look under duress bud  jesus  oh my  oh my god  okay not to belittle this guys life  but this just got more  interesting than the woodcarving finals  when do we decide if we should cancel this event  why would we cancel  well a body did just tumble into the crowd  it didnt land on anybody  it might be traumatic  for who  the mayor when he realizes all the hotel rooms are now empty  we could postpone at least a day im sure thats allowed  do you have any idea how important this event is to the city  no unhealthy guy has heart attack falls over railing  case closed im certainly not declaring it a crime scene  come on you can introduce me to the press  okay just be sensitive  how about if we dont sell the seat the guy landed on  uh can i help

other side  wait a minute two guys up there  excuse  me  hi its time the press are ready  thank you  all right  thank you  man we got to go  sorry could i just try that again  i kind of fumbled the safe and secure part  sure  be sensitive  of course  the finals will continue tomorrow as scheduled  at this point all indications are that  mr cavanaugh was having a heart attack  stumbled forward falling over the railing to his death  but we want to assure everyone  that this building is both safe and  our sympathies go out to mr cavanaughs family  and we would like to offer counseling  whos the blonde  lassiters new partner he transferred his girlfriend  and again we want to assure everyone  coming out for this fantastic event that it is entirely safe  shawn theyre going to stop investigating  one last question and i really have to go wrap up the scene  do something  moo goo gai pan  beef lo mein kung pao  check the food  it was murder  oh did i just say all of that out loud

serious message  brendan appreciates you checking on him  well we were in the neighborhood and gus here is a huge fan  he almost won the spelling bee himself  i took some bad advice  well brendans

czech kid  get me a seating chart ill bet you i know  who brendan was ing on day one   already checked it out  nice  shawn somethings going on with that czech kid  talk to me   the doctor on his

even have to call him  the game was at his house  and i did all of that for nothing  for nothing  youve never completed a thing in your life  now you have  poisoned  i feel somebody poisoned his food  there is a  styrofoam container yes and a  happiness is a golden poem   what fortune cookie   this is ridiculous  is it  mr spencer what we have now points to a medical condition not murder  all appearances show mr cavanaugh having an anaphylactic reaction  not to be out of line but that could be triggered  by several types of poisons or altered medications  or shellfish which he was allergic to  those results will show up in the toxicology report  which we will have a copy of in approximately two weeks  thatll be too late  all the contestants will have gone home  home  you wont be able to finish a real investigation  chief i i sense this  something got out of control and the perpetrator  was willing to kill to cover it up  what proof do you have  only what i feel  why are you still listening to this crap  dude what is your glitch  you you are my glitch   look he got nowhere with his little inhaler assignment  and then he tells the media that we had a murder scene  cut him loose karen  i mean  do whatever you think is best chief  mr cavanaugh was going to make an announcement  what about that  the director said hed spoken of retiring   thats not what he was going to say  oh you know  i know  mr spencer i asked you to check in about the inhaler incident  if you or your partner have anything about that  id be happy to hear about it  otherwise  weve got to get back into the spellmasters room   youre serious  gus the killer was there  theres got to be some other piece of evidence inside  were not going to have time to get in there  besides its locked  well make it work  how hard is it to get into this event without a ticket  impossible  the new spellmaster  check it out  thats exactly what i was hoping youd say  you cant do that to him  gus he has to learn sometime that smoking is bad for him  were picking it up as a new round commences  a lot of excitement in the air  the tension is becoming butyraceous bud  im so sorry if my agonizing pain is inconveniencing you  whats this  its a mark on the carpet  lets go someone must have heard that    positions please  times up shawn  did you hear me shawn  ive got something  yes  prepare the next word  that cant be right  it doesnt mean anything lets go  broadcast in five four three two  maybe this direction  hello we need the word now  is everything okay  somethings wrong send security  uh no sorry for the delay   give me a word  a word  something hard but something you can spell  i can spell anything  except aggiornamento    give me one  no  you are not going to be spellmaster  gus give me a word so we can get out of here  were so close  is everything okay up there  its fine  banana   can you repeat that  yes  banana  banana  shawn this is the third round  you couldve helped me  this is a dead end were walking lets go  definition please  what  a yellow fruit  also a kind of pudding  a delicious pudding  sentence please  what is this  anna banana would like to hear venus by bananarama   banana   b anana  banana   oh wait a second ive got something  we got him he was watching the czech  let me see  we need to get the next word  give me a word  no youre ruining the whole event  suit yourself  onion   onion  onion  onion  even dan quayle could spell that  onion onion   are we off the list  uh no everythings fine  youre using his grocery list  you refused to help me  now ive got to give them something else  mitchum    mitchum  yes  when i go to albertsons  i need to buy some mitchum ice blast   and bananas   that wasnt me i was locked outside  i have a reputation to uphold  so he was watching the czech we have no proof  there was no film in the camera  he was using that lens for something  else besides taking pictures now what  cavanaugh was known for ferreting out rulebreakers  he once caught a kid stealing the advance word list  and everything he did had a purpose  you couldnt have grabbed one of these five minutes ago  were down to the final two spellers  this has been a hardfought battle right from the start  weve had tragedy controversy but when it really mattered  these kids put together a fantastic display of the power of learning  pfft look at this  brendan vu went down on gladiolus   so  so if id been able see any of the competition  i couldve told you that was the winning word  from the first spelling bee in 1929  okay youre scaring me again  all of these words from that round were the winning words  they do that once in a while they make it a theme round  this one won the 1985 bee   this one from 1943  gus what are you saying  guess which kid got the winning word from 1953  youre staring at his father  gus thats who cavanaugh was going to disqualify  thats what he was tracking in the rule book  it was 1953  jiri prochazka you have the next word  mastoparietal   p part of speech  it is an adjective  c could i have the d definition  yes  relating to the mastoid portion of  the temporal bone and to the parietal bone  m  a  s  t  o  p  a  r  i   i got it  lets call the chief  and this years winner of the central  california regionals  is jiri prochazka  whoop it up people  this is what you came to see right here  this is it yes  this competition meant everything to miklous  oh boy gus gus here we go  gus its happening  i know who killed elvin cavanaugh  cant he ever just tell us to arrest someone  he does this a lot   yes  yes  im sorry  im kind of a slave to my visions im a slave  do you want me to cuff him  why would i want that  just a suggestion  they just sort of come when they want to come  jiri  spell soubrette   why is this man speaking  you cant can you  not without help from your dad  and thats not a real inhaler is it  this is crazy this this  cheating  was cavanaughs obsession  he was going to expose you as a cheater  he was going to disqualify jiri  and you knew it and you couldnt let that happen  you had way too much to lose  you slipped into the box  you knew his comfort was food  he was dangerously unhealthy  hes starting to go into shock  you knew he wouldnt stop the bee he never stops the bee  by the end of the round it was too late  he was too dizzy to walk he stumbles  he tumbles over the rail crashes to the chairs below  and there goes the evidence  except for one thing  that inhaler  it sends electronic signals  the transmitter is in your jacket  you sent the signals from the audience to the stage  and i bet at your home well find the van that ran me off the road  when i alerted the police  and a dangerous cocktail of unforgiving poisons  you dont need it  i took your advice i ran the chinese  food through the lab nothings definite  im sorry  he just seemed sure i took a shot  ill take it from here  i couldve won that thing  yeah you couldve  thank the lord you didnt  what is that supposed to mean  come on gus  the guy who wins is saddled forever as  you know the dude that won the spelling bee  im sure you would have dealt with it later  but kids high school kids especially theyre just ruthless  judgmental  horrible little bastards  you wouldnt have been able to date a cheerleader  they wouldnt have invited you to any parties  youd have been the object of ridicule i mean this way  you got to be a smart kid and a cool kid the best of both worlds  thats true i appreciate that shawn  yeah it was a nice balance  thats why i had to give you the wrong letter  you knew that was wrong  oh come on gus  aggiornamento everybody knew it was an i  all right you hold on   you were happy one second ago  i was about to win  i studied for three months  yeah and you would have kept studying  forever and ever all the way till nationals  youre upset now i can see that but youll be fine with it later  you know what that did to me  yes yes i do we went out the next night and  and you were so flustered that you threw caution  to the wind and you hooked up with melinda castleberg   it was nice  come here shawn  at least i was honest  come here  ah shawn what a coincidence  yeah i was just reading the newspaper  a little article that sounded  very familiar about a spelling bee  thanks for the help dad  police ever get that evidence  a funny little bird tipped them off  leg doing better   its getting there doesnt hurt so bad  listen dad the thing about the house the dog  it was kind of a big deal and i know  i held a grudge about it for a while but  i think you were right  a dog needs a house  and a doghouse needs an occupant so  as a token of my appreciation i left you a little something  sincerely thanks  shawn shawn  no no way  enjoy dad
