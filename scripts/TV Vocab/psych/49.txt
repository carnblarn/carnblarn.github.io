20 for the last 10 years  mr claytons private plane lost contact with the tower around 0700  we have reason to believe that his plane crashed somewhere in these mountains  now mr spencer time is of the essence  i need to know of any signals that you pick up that can lead us to him  okay people our window of finding clayton alive is closing  so lets move on out  face it spencer you dont have a chance  of finding that downed plane before we do  but have a nice walk  lets go  note to self get one of those for the office  i hope you have a plan as to how were going to find this crashed plane  and i hope that plan doesnt end up with us being eaten by a bear   dont worry we have a secret weapon  a larger beareating bear  a map thats your secret weapon  this is not a typical map my friend  with large words that people dont understand like latitudinal  and east  this here is a map from my fathers huntsman club  these old geezers make their own maps with trails  and paths landmarks that government maps dont even have  we will use these shortcuts to cover more ground than the cops can  sweet  that sounded big  thats a bear lets get out of here   im not gonna be eaten  me either   did

weve been given a great responsibility  how so  warren claytons dying wish  man what if that had been your dad or my dad  some other random black guy and white guy found him with one breath left  wouldnt you want those dudes to fulfill our dads final wish   especially if it was about us  you think of me as some random black  man we gotta figure out what happened  what did he mean  i mean was he poisoned before takeoff  or was he incapacitated and then somebody else parachuted out   or maybe it was a  it wasnt a bear   i wasnt gonna say that shawn  what were you gonna say  we know you want answers but you gotta understand these things do take time  please it only takes money  have you found satellite imaging of the plane before it crashed   have you run a weather simulation  rest assured  that the sbpd is putting all available resources on this  almost all of its resources  my name is shawn spencer im the department psychic  mrs clayton  im receiving a psychic transmission from your husband  its really more of a voice mail if im being honest  a status update   perhaps a twitter  its called a tweet   no way im saying that  is he for real  in spite of mr spencers first impression  he is actually the one who led us to your husbands plane  he knew what clothes your husband was wearing  how his body was positioned even what cologne he was  i knew what cologne he was wearing i mean he did  well lets hear this supposed message from my husband  its a little cloudy warren is very upset  hes saying  murder hes saying murder  does the word waterloo mean anything to you mrs clayton  youve wasted enough of mrs claytons time with your nonsense  no wait  im really quite shocked  you are  yes it just doesnt show on my face because of years of botox  waterloo is the name of the 18th hole at our country club  warren mentioned just a week ago that he wanted his ashes spread there   yes of course  strange  not strange  psychic acumen  you will solve the mystery of why my husbands plane crashed  technically mr spencers not been hired  this no longer concerns the police  as i will be financing mr spencers operations  i am sure the taxpayers money is better spent  on some social program or a tree  what resources will you be needing  one  a case of red vines individually wrapped  two mini fridge filled with cactus cooler   need a shamwow  a new laptop tell her  a new laptop preferably one made of red vines  gentlemen you are no longer limited by a police department budget  tell me what it will take to get this done quickly  well in that case ill need to become warren clayton  go where hed go do what hed do see what hed see  very well you will start your work  by being my guests at dinner tonight at my estate  the estate  say what   ill send the car to pick you up  the car  nice   the door  the door   big door  the door  of course the door  get out of here  as i gently held his skull  which was fractured in several places  i was able to keep deaths cold clutch  from enveloping clayton just long enough  for him to express his dying wish  shawn that is revisionist history and you know it   you had to be there  i was there   its okay when he embellishes  lies   clarifies  it lets me know that he cares  but what i really want to know is when can i meet your father  my relationship with my father is complicated  as i believe ive mentioned and i know you  youll wanna get in there and fix everything  and no amount of talking or listening  or hugging is going to fix anything between me and my dad  im sorry  i hear you and im going to stop pressuring you  thank you  besides you already know everything there is to know about me  im really quite a simple man  mr spencers private car is here to take him to the clayton estate   thank you my good man  we are ready  dinner will be served shortly  note to self  be rich one day  this is what real class looks like  i feel like im in a museum filled with priceless artifacts  only here youre not allowed to touch or play with anything  but lets not be blinded by the bling  remember were here to fulfill mr claytons dying wish   find out who it was that murdered him  if he was even murdered  for all we know he was hallucinating when he said that  make no mistake gus when i cradled the mans head  and he breathed his last breath he looked right into my eyes  and i am certain he knew exactly what he was saying  i was there you didnt cradle anything  there you are  im sorry to keep you waiting i was putting things away  so many memories of clay thats what i called him  is that an ultrahigh modulus hyper carbon racket  this is my birthday present from him last year  he even signed me up for tennis lessons with malavia  malavia washington the onetime wimbledon finalist  but hes a marvelous teacher i never missed a lesson  thank you mrs clayton for inviting us here to your beautiful home  my pleasure  were all very eager to learn the circumstances  behind my husbands accident  our son is beside himself about it  garvin remember mommy telling you about the psychic  who saw why papas plane crashed  thats unusual  its very heathers  what do they call you  gar   vin  i get it even though i was like  zero when that movie came out  man stop trying to look cool  i have peeps shawn  you have two peeps and one of thems made out of marshmallow  mrs clayton you dont mind my asking who is the girl in the family photos  thats my daughter nyna shes no longer with us  im so sorry to hear that  quiet everyone  mr spencer will now have a revelation  regarding the cause of warrens crash  what have a revelation  im not  its too early for that we havent even had our foie gras yet  foie gras  i have to decipher psychic signals  its very important that i tap into your husbands aurora  tell me mrs clayton does he have a smoking jacket that i could wear  does he have down sheets and if so are they hypoallergenic  because i would hate for my signals to get  all scrambled up while im sleeping here tonight in your home  based on your earlier display   i expected immediate results  bogus  poser  asthma   hes allergic to rich white people  sorry  as i was saying  i pay for results  my new chin is proof of that  our family needs closure before warrens will is unsealed this weekend  since you are unable to deliver rosa would you put  mr spencers food in some sort of a bag  where shall i have the car drop you off  hold that thought  as luck would have it  exactly two of my psychic channels are clearing up  and i am getting something  i thought you might  it has nothing to do with mr clayton and everything to do with you  youve been seeing a tennis instructor every week for the la year  but you havent been playing tennis though you have been playing with balls  i see a very   compromising image  i dont know what you mean  is that why you practice at night  this isnt supposed to be about me  no wonder you have so many sexy tennis outfits  im not gonna sit here and be judged if i were having an affair it would be  because we have a loveless marriage and not through any fault of my own  i dont talk ill of the dead  ill talk about him any way i please  in fact not that i owe you an explanation  but before he died things had gotten better  he was trying to be the man that i once loved  funny you should chime in  you know the claytons philandering ways better than anyone  seeing as how you were in fact senor claytons mistress  what  thats why you pray to st dwynwen  the patron saint of dirty filthy lovers in the nighttime  who is this man make me make him leave  you had an affair with my husband  how dare you   youre no better puta  you know what this is all your fault  you pushed him away and he took it out on me  taking away my porsche making me get a job  selling my tiger and i hated you both  you blame everybody for your pathetic  this family is crazy as hell  now we see why warren clayton thought he was murdered  as you can see like most families we have our issues  now that you are privy to them i expect you to handle this with discretion  we do have a public image to protect  thats going to be difficult  especially once i prove that it was one of you three  who killed warren clayton  is that so  and how is my favorite police department doing today  lassie looking handsome and jangly  chief  i dont say this nearly enough  you have exquisite teeth  mr spencer you know the last id heard  is that youd taken an assignment that provided you with  more benefits than what we could give you  yes unfortunately  mrs clayton and i were unable to see eye to eye   in other words you got fired  or maybe i was getting too close  or maybe you were acting like an obnoxious little twerp  im sticking with getting too close  its nice to hear the word twerp  has survived the millennium  trust me on this one chief  there is more to warren claytons plane crash than meets the eye  funny the ntsbs preliminary report indicates  that it was an accident due to pilot error  the black box shows that he was coming into sb and descended too rapidly  trust requires evidence mr spencer  im getting distinct visions  family secrets  a large skeleton  in a closet  clayton was trying to make amends  but he was being met with infidelities and backbiting  and front biting  and jealousies  i suppose it couldnt hurt  to check to see if there are any signs of a coverup  just in case theres anything to his premonition  chief come on  and you better come up with something soon  or this will be the second time that youre fired from the same case  i hear you thank you for taking the leap  what time should i expect the car  you think you guys could spring for a case of red vines  this is how i should be living by now  where did i go wrong  i dont know about you gus  but i was born into the wrong family  if i belonged to a club like this id have to cancel my membership  on account of them letting in the likes of me  and if you voted for me well  im afraid you  dont belong in my club either  that doesnt even make sense  neither does thoo but it is a word  no its not  theres simply no way to be sure my point is this  no matter how glamorous their lives look from the outside these   are not our kind of people  will you stop it  take mr clayton for example  he was the patriarch of his family yet where were they  when the life was draining out of his body  and that sweet chariot had swung low to carry him home  out philandering and social climbing i suspect  meanwhile where was i   i was beside him like a true friend  stop it  i see the two of you dont give up easily  you should know that this is now an official police investigation  weve been granted full access and if your familys hiding anything  well find it  we dont hide anything except large amounts of money  illegitimate children and  the fact that were jewish  we may have a lot of secrets but killing clay isnt one of them  the door   the door  right yes the door  i forgot thats a thing with you  good luck getting anyone here to talk to you  shes right  how are we gonna get people to talk to us  let me guess youve got a idea that shouldnt work on paper  but ultimately proves to be reasonably successful  so how long you been members  this is just a trial membership  we only belong to the most exclusive clubs   i had no idea psychics did so well  most dont   some do  many try   few can  i have  since weve been here everyones been talking about clayton   its heartbreaking  plain and simple  come on  he was one of the best hedge fund managers around  one of the only guys showing a positive return in this recession  which is why we put up with some of his more eccentric behavior  to a point  lets keep things interesting 1000 a hole  sure why not  you guys bet like this often  sometimes we actually play for high stakes  im actually getting a reading on both of you gentlemen right now  sorry  i know its your thing but i dont go for that psychic mumbojumbo  what im seeing is that sometimes you play for obscenely high stakes  like the private plane that warren clayton crashed and died in  all right thats pretty good  i lost the jet to clayton in a skins match a couple months ago  now that must have made you pretty mad  sure  but before anybody goes and gets the wrong idea  i was in europe when warrens plane crashed  like i told the cops last time i spoke to warren  he was planning on using the plane to travel more with his family  he even got a private hangar down at the airport for them  that means everyone in his family had access to that plane  this is what i figure i figure  someone in warren claytons family got to that plane  and sabotaged it before he took off  which means we have to get down to that private hangar and look around   lets go  wait  dont you think you should check in with abigail first   why im not on parole  you told her youd call  you cant be your lackadaisical self in this relationship  abigail is the kind of girl that needs a certain amount of effort  relationship shawn needs to step up his game  first of all there is no relationship shawn  or boyfriend shawn  theres just regular shawn and malibu shawn you know that  besides i was with her this morning what am i supposed to check in about   that doesnt make any sense  im not talking about that   im talking about relationships  how do you know about this stuff   a player always knows shawn  please   man hold on  fine  this is a surprise whats the matter  nothings wrong im just calling to check in  coffees ready  hold on  was that my dads voice  im at your dads  i thought we agreed no pressure  yes i said i wouldnt pressure you  so i set it up myself  and its been very interesting to say the least  what did he do did he fire a weapon   tell me he didnt bait a hook  hes been a lot of fun  you wanna see how far i can spit  all right thats it im coming over there right now  no need were just wrapping up  but were making plans for us to have dinner sometime soon  great thats  thats great i cant wait  i gotta go bye  why didnt you tell me to check in sooner  please shawn  if someone asks what were doing here what are we gonna say  this is an airport shawn we cant sniff around   i dont want to end up in guantanamo  gus dont be principal and interest  i already have plan  hello sir we are here for our 200 appointment  is one of you guys gus   appointment for what  its a flight lesson  ill be right with you  go with it  distract him while i take a sniff around  who made the rule that ive to be the distraction   do you know what youre looking for  ill know it when i see it  its not that pebble when youre finished ill need you  to teach me everything youve learned about how a plane works  dont worry  flying is just like driving a car   its not like that at all  you see that youre gonna be fine  i need you to sign this waiver  here here here  here here here here and here  also a copy of your drivers license and insurance  dude this is sweet  ill meet up with you after you land  im ready for my lesson now  you already had it we just landed  im ready for my lesson now  let me ask you a question  how long does it take to refuel a twinengine plane   hey buddy  nobody had access to the new plane but clayton  and heres a new wrinkle in the case  guess which dead billionaire took a fourhour stop  that wasnt in the official flight log  so why would clayton spend four hours in bakersfield  im ready for my lesson now  yeah you are  and what time did you pick him up  thank you wayne youve been very helpful  all right after calling every car service in bakersfield   two  i found the one that took clayton   to the airport  so your hunch was right  he went someplace else while he was there  gus note to self  remember 1600 joshua lane  you cant give me your note to self its a note to yourself  fair enough  at that moment shawn found himself alone  unable to face the journey ahead  you cant do your own omniscient narration either  lets see whats at 1313 mockingbird lane  thats the munsters house it was 1600 joshua lane  thanks note to self  thanks jules  so juliet traced the address to an environmental watchdog agency  its a nonprofit run by a mrs thomas  hows that legislation on the emissions credits coming along  why would clayton come here  mrs thomas   may i help you  i certainly hope so  my name is shawn spencer this is my associate jazz hands  does the name warren clayton mean anything to you  come with me  were investigating the circumstances surrounding mr claytons death  we believe he may have been murdered  thats karma for you you guys believe in karma dont you  yes we do but only because we are karma chameleons  we come and go  my psychic sensors led me here  and i am  getting traces of warrens metaessence  here  there  and somewhat shockingly   right there  well thats uncanny  if only you were as attuned to environmental issues  sorry  i always forget which one is mine so i just open a new one  i like the little clickyclack sound it makes when you   that one didnt do it  yes warren did come visit me  we talked business for a few hours and then he left  later i saw that he was dead i couldnt believe it  you talked business he didnt seem like the environmental type  he wasnt  this companys been at odds with him ever since my husband and i started it   he must be seven feet tall  thats a masai tribesman  charles is standing right next to him  shawn youre wasting paper  rain dance  seriously do you mind  you know what they say about a man with a large carbon footprint  please ignore him so why did mr clayton come see you  he wanted my endorsement in a business move that  lets just say i didnt approve of  when i refused things got heated but im used to clays temper  so many memories of clay thats what i called him  sorry to interrupt im charles  and im shawn spencer and this is  dont forget to schedule that lunch with councilman prather  sure thing   nice to meet you  same here  i think you shouldve stuck with the masai guy  what they wouldve had caramel babies with 30inch verticals  im sorry we have to go thank you for your time   happy  you cant recycle food shawn   how many rules are there  pretty much just that one  now i kind of want to eat it  lets go  theres something shes not telling us  did you see how she changed the subject when her husband came around  plus she called warren clay which is what his wife called him  sounds like mrs thomas is more than just a business acquaintance  sounds like shes another filthy mistress  and she fits warrens type shes all headstrong hot in a  female da or detective on law  order sort of way  like milena govich   like an angie harmon  like mariska hargitay  exactly which explains why the meeting got all heated  in fact before he died he tried to be the man that i once loved  katie erbe  dude  i think warren was trying to reconcile with his wife  and i bet ms green jeans in there wasnt too happy about it   sounds like motive  we gotta get lassie on this  we need to get out of this office  take your time reading it okay  because its going to be  are the police still wasting valuable time on your little theory   that one of us is a murderer  yes about that  i did get a few of my psychic signals crossed  but what is not important mrs clayton   is who accused who of partricide  you mean patricide   whats that  killing a partridge   its a victimless crime  no   whos the victim  the partridge  heres whats important  i have identified the culprit responsible  for your husbands untimely death your family is off the hook  finally so who is it who is responsible for this atrocity  another golddigging yet far less exotic   mistress  mr spencers theory was confirmed  when we found out your husband had recently changed his will  what  upon his death the bulk of his estate is now going to the great green hope  plus forensics confirmed that the planes altimeter was tampered with  and our suspect had her pilots license which means she knew enough  to sabotage the controls its enough for a warrant  thank god  very impressive  im glad my initial instinct about you was correct mr spencer  theres our suspect lets go  stop right there   hands behind your back  what is going on  cant believe she showed up at the will reading   who does she think she is  my daughter  my sister  who are we talking about  nyna thomas you have the right to remain silent  lets go  thats my daughter nyna shes no longer with us  i cant believe you think i would kill my own father  in my defense i initially thought you were sleeping with him  how pumped are you that i was wrong about that  but you called him clay instead of dad or father  i stopped calling him dad years ago when i denounced our way of life  okay then why were you so uncomfortable when your husband came into the room  because i try to keep my past   from interfering with my new life with charles  then we can all agree that this is completely your fault  when warren came to visit me  to tell me some story about how hed changed  and he wanted to reconcile i promptly told him to kiss off  and keep his dirty money  but now that hes dead i cant help but wish id given him a second chance  listen nynas a saint and thats why she didnt mention the money at first  what else have you failed to mention nyna  well i didnt think it was important at the time  but now i realize that it might be  i overheard my dad arguing with one of his golf buddies  something about a problem with one of his investments  golf buddies   so what can i do for you boys  mr wiswall  you told us that you hadnt spoken to warren clayton for months  then i had a vision of an argument  something about investments returns  capital  gains thats a thats a thing right  no flies on you  im afraid thats only the tip of the iceberg   you see im also seeing  wait wait  all right all right  let me just set the record straight  just before warren died i called him livid  about money missing from my account  he then confessed to me  that his billiondollar hedge fund was a giant ponzi scheme  stop right there  i simply refuse to believe that henry winkler had anything to do with this  wait if that were the case the sec ever found out that would mean  clayton would be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars  and his investors would be left with nothing   including yourself  hed already lost all my money  i had to sell my house liquidate all my assets  christ im living in a hotel  no one knows because ive just been  keeping up appearances around the club   please continue  i was determined  to get my money back one way or another so  i called clayton the night before he died  i asked him to at least return the plane  then i could sell it for 5 million or so  the bastard wouldnt even agree to that  not even when i threatened to make an anonymous tip to the sec  who else knows about this alleged fonzie scheme  no one that i know of  i kept all the falsified documents boxes full  in case i needed proof  im sensing you wont have to hold onto them for much longer   sorry im late  no problem  abby and i were just talking about my time as a detective  im actually surprised that you never applied to the academy  especially since youre kind of doing the same thing  we dont really need to get into that do we dad  i trained him to be a real detective  he wanted to be a professional asswipe instead  well dad the wipe doesnt fall very far from the ass  tree and it used to bother me when you say things like that  but not anymore you know why  because i discovered that no matter who you are or what family you come from  fathers and their children rarely see eye to eye  shawn i think that you and your father would communicate better if you  trapcaught prawns   sounds sad  right no fixing  id really love to hear abbys perspective on all this  sweetheart  i think your father would be able to better respect your decisions  if the two of you were able to share more of your emotions   hes not really the sharing type  its worth a shot  really youre gonna pretend  like youve had an emotion since walker texas ranger got canceled  at least im willing to give it a try  okay all right try this on for size  youve been in a horrible fiery plane crash  youre clinging to life all of your organs on the inside  pancaked  you have 15 seconds to live  what message do you want to get to me your only son before you die   im not gonna  go   im not gonna answer  see what i mean  its a little harsh to talk about him being in a horrible crash  you see whatd i tell you  excuse me  wiswalls turning   perfect timing  lassie  jules on the way   text from gus  major break in our case  i have to go  dear abby dr phil enjoy  dr phil is bald   doesnt even fit  youre not bald  youre just taller than your hair  youd better not be wasting our time  yeah the case against nyna is really strong  prepare yourselves  im about to bust open a brandnew angle on this case  including brandnew motifs   motives  like fraud embezzlingment  and subprime time toxic assets   thats a thing right  you are a child  dont touch anything   hes dead  man why does this always happen  we have to start checking first  possible homicide down at carlyle hotel  whats a prospectus  investment records  that must be the registration number for warren claytons hedge fund  whoever killed wiswall must have taken the evidence with them  good news  i think i know where theyre going next  theyre probably only here for the photo ops  its typical   dearly beloved  i think mr clayton wouldve wanted me   to spread his remains  okay shawn thats enough  you only spoke to him for like 30 seconds   he didnt even know your name  we were beyond names  if anyone close to warren clayton would like to say a few words  what what do you think youre  warren clayton is communicating with me  take your hands off of my husband  from in here  dust  in the wind  all we are is dust  in  what are you doing  you killed warren clayton   thats crazy  is it  makes perfect sense to me  nyna wanted nothing to do with her fathers money you did  i know what nyna said and im begging you to reconsider  we could do so much with that money  warren refused to reconsider  he was gonna change his will back to its original form  when he returned home the next day  that is precisely when you set your dastardly plan into effect  like your wife and apparently everyone else in this family  you have extensive knowledge of aircraftery  i can see the altimeter in the wreckage of warrens plane   altimeter  altimeter  altimeter  and the elevation is off by 1200 feet  this means it was tampered with  you caused the crash  and so warren clayton died  before he could take your nonprofit organization out of his will  and you thought you were in the clear until  garvin   what  come on dude  yeah i get it it was that guy  until you heard about warrens argument with his golf buddy chad wiswall  knowing that wiswall was going to blow the whistle on the ponzi scheme  thus freezing mr claytons assets  you went ahead and clubbed him too  this is ridiculous  nyna tell him  is that why you disappeared for hours after my father left  and why you were shredding paper last night  sweetie  you deserved the money we deserved it  we couldve done so much good  officer hold this man until detectives lassiter  and ohara arrive on the scene  here take this my work is done  please   no need to thank me  thats not for you  this is still a funeral son  of course   good job  thanks  i think i breathed in some dead guy  ground ball to second  davis has it throw to first  come on in have a seat just watching the game  all right about last night  let me be the first to apologize for my behavior  considering the fact that weve never tried to kill each other  im willing to admit that our family is not as messed up as i thought we were  all right very cool very cool apology accepted  and you know you asked me that question at dinner the other night  he one about if i only had 15 seconds left to live  ive got an answer for you  id want to tell you that  well id do my best to express  look what i want you to know   wait wait  thats it pop youre dead  im closing your eyelids im taking off your watch  putting that thing on craigslist  just wanted to say i love you
