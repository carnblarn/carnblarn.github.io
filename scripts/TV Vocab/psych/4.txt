reader  no thats just  what you tell everybody  i want you to try this chair  im not trying that chair shawn  ill sit on the birthing ball  i kid you not  that thing is like a refreshing waterfall  cascading down your vertebrae  it might help with your stomach issues  who told you i had stomach issues  uh my nose  the vent in the bathroom  air fresheners all over the place  im trying a new medication  for my lactose intolerance  i believe the problem is physical  and i think it can be cured  by what i am now referring to as  the magic springy bounceup chair   hey shawn smoothies are

chief would you like some  thats not my smoothie  i dont care whose smoothie it is  i dont even remember why i asked you to stay now  you want us on that case with the blond woman  mmhmm wintersby  willachek  whistlerbottom no no  wilcroft  no thats not  okay wait a minute  were you listening in on my conversation  i dont know if i heard it psychically  or if i saw you walk by  with her and detective lassiter  but i definitely heard the word psychic   the woman  raylene  said she visits an occasional psychic  she wasnt asking for one  well not in so many words  no not in any words  this is a bank robbery case  we dont need psychics for a bank robbery case  bank robbery mmhmm  i didnt read anything in the paper about bank robbery  it was four years ago  so it went unsolved  it was solved  well then what does she need a psychic for  gus that is a perfectly reasonable question  thank you chief well be leaving now  im sorry im sorry  im still confused  her husbands partners  are getting out of jail  this is a routine warning that we issue  when someone may potentially be in danger  this is the part where we offer up our services  no i think this is the part where we leave  thats a good idea  but we  believe it or not mr spencer  crimes were solved long before you got here  and they continue to be solved when youre not around  oh i remember what i wanted to tell you  what  stay out of my chair  bank robbers  dude thats awesome  we should go find lassiter and our future client  we got to go  dude this woman is on an eternal quest  for a good psychic  thats me  im going to go find her  im staying right here  great idea  wait 10 seconds and make an entrance  drink some  are you saying that im in danger  your husbands partners are being paroled today  i have reason to believe  their first order of business is going to be  to try and find that lost money  but the only person  who knew where that money ended up  was my husband  i know that but do they  hey lassy  juliet  i dont believe weve met  or did we meet  in a bank  no thats not it  why am i getting bank  piggy bank  sperm bank  doesnt matter  im shawn spencer  i am the official head psychic here at the department  you dont have a title  and there is serious doubt as to whether  youre really even psychic  i solved the mccallum disappearance  and the summerland murder  oh and i found your keys  and your badge  out  shawn where are my keys  what no out  if you dont mind were a little busy  we have a  excuse us raylene  do we know each other  no we dont  im sorry psychic remember  sometimes i cant turn it off  do you do readings  we do it all  full service  im a bit of an enthusiast  i used to have a regular girl read for me  really  uh  heres a card  were at the beachfront location  i could put my cell number on the back  if you have any questions  anytime really  thank you youre so kind  this is a pharmaceutical company  like i said we do it all  well i always say a man with many hats   doesnt like his haircut  exactly  i thought i was the only one  who read that book  thats my favorite mine too  and scene  dude what took you so long this is good stuff  youve got to see what happened to this car  i mean it was really  what  what happened here  oh that  i had a drywaller come in  take out a wall  a wall  this is a rental  what do you think our landlord is going to say  gee i dont know thank you  gus this place was way too cramped  my name is on that lease  dont worry  ill make sure you get a thankyou note too  youre taking my name off the lease  and the door and these frisbees  gus dont be ridiculous  look im almost positive  this isnt a loadbearing wall  but if youre really concerned why dont you  go jump up and down in the attic and make sure  what is she doing here  ah  shes our first real client  actual client  hired for the job  actual client  go on man  i have to admit  when i met you at the police station  i was intrigued  so i checked your recent track record  its amazing really  well its its a team effort  not really  i do most of the work  what can we help you with maam  i need you to get in contact with someone  well tracking people down is our specialty  what  oh its not now  this one might be a little tricky  how tricky  is the person out of the state  country  hes dead  ah and i assume thats why you need a psychic  hold on  dead  like deaddead  currently being eaten by worms  hes actually entombed  in a mausoleum  gus hes ascended  to the next dimension  its fine  no shawn  i think we might be at a bit of an impasse  what exactly do you need to know  my husband was not a perfect man  he got himself in a bit of trouble  okay ill be host it was a lot of trouble  he got involved in a bank robbery  he was one of three  but the only one who didnt go to prison  unfortunately the reason he didnt get caught  was that he drove his car down an embankment  wait  i see rain  no roads no  there was a fiery crash wasnt there  yes  what would you like me to ask  raylene  well this is hard to say  but he was the one designated to bury the money  they were to all meet later and divide the cash  only his partners were caught first  so why wait until now  his partners think that i know where he hid the money  if i dont give it to them  theyre going to kill me  shawn can i speak to you outside please  i guess  dude what is wrong with you  shawn i dont know how to break this to you  but you are not psychic  clue me in on the problem here  its a big problem when the job requires  extensive conversing with the dead  gus what is the question that she wants answered  where is the money right  that doesnt require  any actual dead guy chitchat  we simply trace his last steps  do a little research  ask a few questions  and bingo  stop saying bingo   you know how i hate that  okay fine  yahtzee  were not doing it shawn  mahjongg  gus  mrs wilcroft  raylene  raylene  your problem is  outside of our reach  you are in real danger  id like to recommend  police protection  im pleased to be of service  thank you thank you  i know theyre in there  just so you know  i am uncomfortable  with intraoffice romance  i wasnt considering it  and im completely uncomfortable with the implication  so it wasnt true  the rumor about you and your last partner  im not going to dignify that with a response  mmhmm  this is them  the bank robbers  yeah a bit worse for wear  than the day i arrested them  you caught them  i was part of a team but yeah it was mostly me  thats a big deal  wouldve been a big deal  if i found the money and closed the case  things like that make a career  instead i got a bunch of loose ends a dead guy  and 36 million in cash  that vanished into thin air  its funny they dont look so mean  what do you mean mean  they look like repairmen  big repairmen  but they dont look like killers  duck  eyes of a serpent ears of a bat  send us a signal from  shawn  i hear a voice  can i see you outside please  it wants me to come outside  now  i should go  is that my bathrobe  what are you doing  what does it look like im doing  im having a seance  you cant have a seance  there are no rules against having a seance  anyone can have one  its le a garage sale or plastic surgery  okay first of all  technically you need to have a permit to have a garage sale  secondly you cannot speak to the dead  oh gus you dont understand at all do you  i dont need to make contact with the dead  no i need to speak  with all the people in that room  theyre witnesses  we can piece together the rest  based on the information they give us  im already on to something  check this out  the dead guy was on the lam  for three days with the cash   he had help  from whom  im almost there  raylene  yes shawn  im sensing the last time he called  before the accident  ellen was the only one who talked to him  ellen  yes i feel that deeply  you didnt tell the police that did you  no i was afraid  hes my brother i didnt want to turn him in  no of course not  where did he call from  a pay phone outside a store  yes it was a store i feel it  which store  uh i think it was a  thrifty mart  up north  hed been driving  i ive always imagined  it was the one near pismo  pismo yes  but the spirits are confused  they need more specific directions  nearest cross street  uh just past the park  we used to hike with roger  whos roger  hes our cousin  really  but wait theres more  the spirits are asking me  what is rogers address  i really havent seen roger in years  come on ellen work with me  think harder  sorry  how about a phone number  okay  gus what have you done  youve broken the chain of spiritual trust  i didnt break anything  dont ruin it for everyone gus  im not ruining anything  listen raylene  i have to apologize to you  you seem like a very decent person  but what you need is protection not this  a bodyguard a policeman  i can assure you there is no spirit in here  what  and let me make you a guarantee  there is absolutely no way  therell be any sort of contact with zombies  you okay  i think thats all for us tonight ladies  did you do that  why would i ruin our totally cool window  for effect  to make me think you contacted an evil ghost  gus please  why didnt you float that idea by me sooner  thats genius  somebody obviously wants us off this case  i think its those convicts  but whoever it is well never find them  i just saw them run off  you sure about that  yeah  ladies stay here  were going after them  or it  lets get some tacos  and then the window just shattered  and you think ghosts did it  no no no no  though there may have been some women present  who thought ghosts were responsible  i blame it on the two convicts  from the holmby bank robbery  im sorry  i still dont understand why that means  you need to see the entire case file  oh no juliet  we dont need to see the whole thing  no just the cover page  one or two others here or there  definitely the witness list  you got to see that  and the chiefs okay with this  oh yeah yeah  i dont think so  no no  i liked the other girl better  not me  hey since were here we should do some digging  good idea  why dont you dig me  getting the hell out of here  and going to get some sleep  i set you up for that  lobbed it right over the plate  mr spencer  oh  hey you what a surprise  you look different  yes i took your advice  three weeks without a cigarette  well it has certainly enhanced your aura  and remember it wasnt my advice  it was your grandmas spirit  have you  spoken to her again  shes here  now  yes where  in this hallway  no  in the records room  i thought i felt something eerie in there  me too  unfortunately im not allowed down there  please  no no no not too much light  you dont want to scare her away  yes  oh yes  yes i can feel her all right  shes  shes over by the ws  why  no  w  this is it  im nervous  dont be  i want you to relax  breathe  close your eyes  why would she be in the ws  i dont know  did you know any ws  that bastard walter  walter  your  ex  wow yes  i hear something  me too  paper  no  no its not paper  yes its clearly paper  you have to concentrate  breathe deeply  no uhuh  im definitely not feeling anything  anymore  i think weve lost her  im so sorry  i couldnt reach her  its okay  i know how temperamental the spirit world can  your hand  it was the spirits  its a message from beyond  what does it say  i think i should keep it to myself  its a private message  dude you look so peaceful  when youre sleeping  never come in my apartment again  ive seen the holmby bank file  shawn i dont want to  the cousin is the key  the cousin the sister mentioned  and immediately regretted  you could see it  she let it slip  dude the guy runs a cemetery  which one  oh i dont know the one david wilcroft is buried in  i bet you dollars to donuts  he knows exactly where the money is  look its all right here on my hand  his name is roger blaine  creepy as allgetout  lives on the grounds alone no wife no kids  not that part  thats the italian seamstress i met at the renaissance fair  how much further is this place  i dont know    and you didnt get me a donut  i did get you a donut and then i ate it  i cant believe im doing this  solving a crime  that happens to be our job description  no driving so far on a whim  a whim he says  a guy dies  and gets buried by his own weirdo cousin  in a tiny cemetery way up the coast  in a town with a population of 200  that is not a whim that is a clue  you think the cousin has the money  roger blaine  that even sounds like an alias  he couldve killed wilcroft  or it could have been the sister  gus theyre all kind of creepy  the dead guy the undertaker the sister raylene  whoa whoa whoa  theres nothing creepy about raylene  nothing creepy about the melodramatic widow  are you serious  who marries a bank robber  who sees a psychic every week  theres nothing wrong with her shawn  okay what is this thing you have  with women in jeopardy  they have a name for this you know  its called the stockholm syndrome  no its not  florence nightingales disease  are you trying to be funny  you cant ridicule me because i want to help  i can when you want to help too much  you have an unnatural affinity for this woman  that i simply cannot wrap my brain around  she dresses  like shes on her way to a pta meeting  fine  she reminds me of somebody who was very important to me  who dont worry about it  oh no  what  dont say it what  dont say meredith baxter birney  its not mbb  this is unhealthy  okay you were in love with her too  i loved her because she was mrs keaton  and she gave birth to apk  its not her anyway  who is it  my babysitter  your babysitter  yes my babysitter  gus mrs pilderman was in her late 60s  mrs pilderman was 37 years old  and she was a nurse shawn  she taught me you know about books and art  things like that  things like skinnydipping  i did not go skinnydipping with mrs pilderman  well at least that sheds some light on it  huh nobodys home  no somebodys here  you can see through doors now  thats the new thing  i can smell the laundry vent  no you cant  okay  oh gus please with the supersmeller  you have to stop  i can smell it too  i told you  jeans and socks and underwear  and a bounce sheet  make jokes  how long do you think it takes to dry a load of clothes   somebodys here and not answering the door  gus  i apologize  thats very impressive detective work  i feel a little bad about the donut thing now  you should  dang it  lets try the back  just stay here  watch  whoa  youre not roger  no no no youre uh  youre david wilcroft  arent you supposed to be dead  gus  look its not that easy to explain  im not a real criminal  i just  i got in a little over my head  you robbed a bank  i didnt want to  i was in a bad place  they trusted me  i was supposed to stash the cash  you lost the money  yeah howd you know  uh  it was it was raining really hard  for two whole days  it was the worst rainstorm in 30 years  you couldnt find it  yeah by the time the roads reopened  every marker i left was gone  it was washed away  i lost three and a half million dollars  driving back  i nearly drove off the road  it was then i realized  id be better off dead  and you have been digging ever since  every chance i can get out there  without the risk of being seen  by hikers or mountain bikers  i dig  you know what  raylene is in agony over this  i didnt mean her any harm  you were never going to tell her  i couldnt  excuse us a moment  what  gus  whats happening with you and this guys wife  are you having feelings for this woman  thats ridiculous  no gus this is wonderful  look we didnt know he was alive  when she came to us  she was technically available  shawn stop it  im not hitting on your wife  no hes not but there is  some serious crushing here  dude i am not blind  a man with many hats doesnt like his haircut  what what book is that from  shes a charming woman  a charming woman  youre jane austen now  she is an adult  she is attractive  she is mature shawn  david help me out here  tell him that this is healthy  raylene is a very dynamic woman  everybodys drawn to her  look guys  i know you want to turn me in  but youve got to understand i am close  i am so very close  ive covered nearly every inch inside the kalish trail loop  where i buried it  and you want us to let you find it  get her to hide someplace  someplace safe  i just want to return the money  and get on with my life  we have to think this through  yeah  you know in my mind  they were the lucky ones  they got to go to prison  pay off their debt to society  ive been living as a dead man  if raylenes going to find out that im alive  at the very least  dont let it come from a stranger  let it come from me  were letting him go  hes not going anywhere until he finds that money  i doubt thatll be anytime soon  he did have cool hair though  were missing something else here  hes the key to solving this puzzle  we need to tell raylene  whoa whoa whoa  were holding all the cards why would we do that  because shes in danger  maybe we can fix that  your husband hes alive  gus  remember the part where we werent going to tell her  we never said that  davids alive  we found him hes with his cousin  roger  no no no that cant be  im sure your head is spinning  and that you dont feel  completely safe right now  but rest assured we do have a plan  we are going to put the convicts  back in jail  where they belong  and are going to stay for a while  well put these guys behind bars  where they belong  ugh  so  who authorized this stakeout  what  you know who set it up  i did  i mean who sanctioned it  approved it above you  above me  i dont think i like where this is going  i just mean it should be officially sanctioned  as per the police code  which one   tickytack doesnt apply  in most cases  someone still has to authorize it  oh thats right i remember now  i did  what about 42211  what about it  well it states that  its superseded by 1575  not necessarily  if youre in the jurisdiction  of a 2340 it is  maybe  maybe  technically  a 2340 only applies in federal cases  what are you doing in here  i thought we could share info  what are we looking at get out of my car  shouldnt you be wondering  how i slid in and lounged for two minutes  without you noticing  youre new and pretty so its okay  youve got 10 seconds before i latch the doors  and haul you down to the station  they dont know where the money is  what  isnt that why youre following them  so theyll lead you to the money  psychic  its amazing  youll get used to it  look  the dead guy buried the money  and then lost it  but thats beside the point  i think we can cut our losses  and put these two back behind bars  if we work together  and how do we do that  first we dress up as musketeers  and make a very special pact  come on you watched them  pull at least a handful of probation violations  youve been tailing them  you saw what they did to my office  they havent been anywhere near your office  they were near enough to bust out my window  two nights ago  youre wrong  you lost them anyway  well talk tomorrow  bye juliet  they dont want our help  of course they dont  but they also lost our guys  did you see where they went  did i see where they went  you mean did i see their car turn right on riverside  or did i see the parking tag  from the 2400 motel  touch  did you see what kind of whiskey they bought  shawn please  time is being wasted  this is breaking and entering  no no no  only if we break something  and then enter something  entering is just entering   im not breaking the law shawn  look you want to save your little widow  weve got to find some evidence to put these guys away  im standing firm on this  fine  what about the window  if it just opens  does that count  depends  ooh  i see something shawn  i might be able to slide this chain off  shawn  gus im trying to concentrate  you might want to turn around  what  whoa  you guys drive come back  okay okay  was that really necessary  were we resisting  man window inspector  in a motel  okay i lied  i did im sorry  the truth is  im a psychic  thats what i do  perhaps youve read about me in the paper recently  ive been in jail four years  you dont have papers  i thought you guys had tv and yard darts  and mahjongg and  okay  i i i uh  i come bearing a message  from a departed being  david wilcroft  wants you to know  that he lost the money  its gone forever  why are you telling us this  uh he he is concerned  that youre going to harm  rins rackle  raylene raylene  oh thats funny  that is funny  sse can you make sure that we are not disturbed  you can  can you prove youre a psychic  sure  sure uh  uh you are  a bank robber  yes  you  did not like prison  you are wearing the same pants  that you were released in  and you have  youve packed on a few pounds since being incarcerated  no look man im talking about real proof  like a test  now look if youre right  you live  if youre wrong  man you dont want to be wrong  heres the thing  its not really a parlor trick  no and  and i dont want to cheapen it  look prove it now lets go  whats wrong with you move  okay okay  how many fingers  h how many uh  fingers  what are you are you kidding  i mean  do i look like im joking around  how many fingers  weve got to be able to come up  with something better times up  four  all right how many now  two  now can we move on  because gus and i have some questions  three  for instance  why was it so funny when three  and is it possible  still three  now its technically two and a half fingers  and  the guy with the gun  is flipping me the bird  you can see my fingers cant you  no no  yes yes i can  its the reflection of the tv  bouncing off the mirror to the  to the water pitcher here  okay maybe not  were going to try this one more time  now how many fingers  dude  you need to stop picking three  respect man  oh man thats  yeah  theyre back here  i cant believe we lost them  dont think that wasnt on purpose  to wilcroft  a hell of a wheel man  he was the wheel man  yeah  you should know that right  well shawns visions sometimes are scattered  incomplete  how does a wheel man miss a turn  on a mountain road  oh i tell you what he didnt miss that turn  i bet he just drove straight off  you want to know why  because he was trying to get away from his  wife  damn youre good  hey no no  thats that cant be why would he be  we called her the viper   she was cold as hell  man we had to do whatever she said  we had no choice  who the wife  raylene  you know her  well she came to us  she wanted to contact david  figures  that was her only weakness the occult  man shed stop at nothing  to get her hands on that money  no she only wanted that money  to protect herself from you two  from from us  yeah  man the last thing we would ever do is cross her  all we wanted to do was get away from her  especially david  she ran him around  like he was an animal  he did whatever she said  i dont know if you guys  got caught up in the charm or whatever  but ill tell you man that was her key  she could play anybody  im telling you shes a very dangerous lady  raylene was the mastermind  whoo  i already knew that  because im a psychic  come on guys we should go  uh  you dont want to go out that way  why  we got company outside  is there another way out of here  i cant believe i just crawled  through a bathroom window  it has to be a lie  gus youre attracted to dangerous women man  it happens  joan jett for example  penny marshall grace jones  the woman who played pinky tuscadero  she seemed so sincere  so vulnerable you know  yeah turns out shes a domineering snake lady  who drove her browbeaten husband  to fake his own death  and we  we led her right to the poor bastard  man  lizzie borden  kathy bates  raylene this is not  whoa  what todays gun day  sit  just rush in here   bad idea shawn  let her hang herself  quiet  raylene  im sensing that this is going to end  very very badly  find me my money  i know you have it  he doesnt have it  im the only one who knows where the money is  whoa whoa  he doesnt know where the money is  of course i know where the money is  shawn i dont know what your strategy is  but you dont know where the money is  you have five seconds  one  really  two the countdown  three  okay  its in the crypt  the moneys in the crypt  david here certainly isnt  think about it raylene  roger runs the place  its the perfect hiding spot  they can get in and out  whenever they want  pry it open  with what  with the stanchion  huh  apparently those are called stanchions gus  were you aware of this yes i was  how did you figure out  that money was in the crypt  im bluffing  this is not a good time to bluff  i think its a great time  she was going to kill us  and besides ive always thought  a crypt was a great place to stash loot you know  its kind of like a vault  you can just get in there whenever you need to  shes going to figure out youre lying  eventually but come on  its going to take a while to bust open a crypt  wow  not as long as i was hoping for  help him get it out  raylene please  what are you waiting for  that  son of a david  i dont believe this  what are you going to do raylene  shoot all of us  none of you are armed  i can do whatever i want  really now  drop it  you move away from the stanchion  uh  what took you so long  shut up  he does have nice hair  yeah  that takes a lot of upkeep though  yeah  youve got to worry about split ends  dandruff  dandruff  its horrible its awful  lets get out of here  the wilcrofts are not talking at all  to our investigators  we get indications from their lawyers  that they will plead the fifth to all charges  which leaves me  with a whole slew  of loose ends  for instance detective lassiter  could you tell me how you made the discovery  that david wilcroft was still alive  well actually chief  we never made that connection per se  we were on a stakeout  yes i see that  you describe it as  harrowing and intense   im sorry those were my words  you wanted me to spellcheck it  i still dont understand  how that connected you to david wilcroft  well thats where we come in chief  some good work was done  by detective lassiter  he was amazing  he figured out  there was a connection to roger blaine  the cousin  who was involved  with the faking of the death  burnt body no dna  pretty convenient  he deducted  i never said that  no but you thought it  thats how good you are lassy  you practically solved this entire case  up here without uttering a single word  i did nothing of the kind  i was following the money and protecting raylene  who turned out to be the dangerous one  which i picked up  from detective lassiters massive brain  not true  true tr not  it was so  gentlemen please  so we still have no idea where the money is  i got nothing from him  but if he figures anything out  ill be the first to know  would you excuse us for a moment  were going to have a private conversation  i know what youre doing giving you credit  trying to get me to admit youre psychic  youve already done that  no i havent  youre right im sorry  you didnt actually say it  spencer no matter what you do  i will never  never ever say those words  which words  you know which words  no man i lost my train of thought  which words  oh  that you think im a psychic  those words  so when are you going to tell them where the money is  i dont know where the money is  sure you do  youre seeing  dirt  am i right  no  what are we doing here  its saturday  i thought wed get some fresh air  we drove an hour out of town to get some fresh air  well theres that  and  and were going to find  the dread pirate wilcrofts dirty booty  shawn the guys been digging for four years  were going to find it in one afternoon   and i brought some chicken  for a hearty snack  and how do you plan on finding it  well he said he dug up every inch of the kalish loop  after he buried it here right  yes three miles worth  but it was dark and it had rained  and he said he thought it was right off the path  he may have gotten lost  i heard the story shawn  did he realize  that there is a j kalish and an i kalish trail  dude its completely defunct  check it out  only used by the rangers  for back fires  medical access  mud slide emergency routes  like for instance  during a torrential rainstorm  otherwise its gated  and it looks completely abandoned  from the road  okay i find it i get credit  im the psychic  i have to get a vibration  chief yes  im getting a trailhead a pathway  and something else  what is it  chicken bones  yes tandoori style  fresh  oh i bet they were delicious  yes
