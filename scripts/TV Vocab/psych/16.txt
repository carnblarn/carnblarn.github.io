weve assured him that  i can speak for myself  and stop slouching  every time i bring in some sort  of professional protection my attacker gets closer  my car has been tampered with  my trailer has been broken into  accidents follow me everywhere  what i need is someone who can anticipate  my attackers next move  someone who can move about undetected  youre talking about a psychic  someone who can see danger before it occurs  someone who can say nigel duck  before the bullet exits the chamber  spare me the theatrics  can you do it or not  look we are asking you to go undercover  no one outside of this office will know that  youre on the job  what about detective lassiter  absolutely not  his hair looks like its been poured  out of a cake mold  nigel get ready to feel safe  jules i

undercover  well nigels essentially a monster  hes an equalopportunity bastard  the list of suspects can be narrowed down  to everybody  even i kind of want to kill him  so where does that leave us  well there have been at least nine incidents  that can be counted as attempts on his life  in nine different cities  we have to assume its someone whos here every week  great  no not great  that only narrows it down to crew security and fans  most of which are pretty diehard  were gonna have to talk to everybody  which is gonna be difficult because i think  im developing a polyp  o eeee o o ahaah

svengali  jules  shawn i think i would know if i were a svengali  fine  whatever  i guess my heart vibes are jammed  never mind  wait  so what exactly do you do on the show  zappito  zapato  its

 you hate him  and you cant seem to account for your whereabouts  for most of the last 60 days  everybody hates nigel  and everybody loves raymond  but everybody doesnt have a vacant sense of morality  and an assault with a deadly weapon charge on their record  that was a publicity stunt  the weapon was a forklift and i was drunk  on a spray bottle of charlie  well im gonna need some answers and fast  otherwise you and i are gonna turn on the hot lights  do the lindsay hop and see who cracks first  now youre trying to seduce me  i never thought i would make this sound  in my lifetime but ew

kill a clydesdale  in that tuna nicoise salad sandwich  you see your hotel detail couldnt even manage  one room  well pardon me but im not the one  out ordering room service with a big target  painted on my back  it was a standing order  were almost through with the screen  of your room mr st nigel  you can return when we clear it  fantastic because to be honest  gus and i have slightly more pressing issues  at the moment  we need to rehearse  how did you know that sandwich  didnt come from the kitchen  easy there were only  all the other ones from the hotel have 87  are you serious no  the other ones have swords  nigels had a tooth pick  im not rain man gus  you sing like rain man  spencer  you missed something  we found prints  was he in a little red corvette  under the cherry moon  fingerprints  they belong to emilina saffron  so do the drugs we found in the food  crossreferenced them with her prescriptions  and her medical records  if youll excuse me im gonna go get  a warrant

case is just about closed  is that what this laissezfaire  halfbaked effort is about huh the case  i thought you were in it to win it  jules are you feeling okay  sharp as cheddar  you know i wouldnt put all my eggs in emilinas basket shawn  shes barely lucid enough to form word endings  much less plan a series of attacks on nigels life  she could be like keyser soze  with one shoe  i think  until we get a confession  we gotta keep our eyes on the prize  now lets take it back to the broken melting robot huh  gus watch me   o shell be coming o  instant noodles danish diet coke  took you long

yes and another thing  i wasnt even at the hotel this morning  i slept on a car in the parking lot  that makes me innocent  you slept on a car  well yeah  it its a long story  i usually sleep in the lifeguard station  but i didnt want to make a scene so  your fingerprints are all over nigels room  we hook up sometimes  i went to his room yesterday to see if he was lonely  it was a moment of weakness  a girls got needs  all right gentlemen  prepare to taste the most succulent  evenlymarinated beef that you have ev  is that my robe  it is indeed horace  and it is comforting me at an elite spa level  i think i should also point out that im absolutely famished and  thoses filets actually smell promising  sweet  thats what im talking about  its henry  theyre rib eyes  is there a problem  well look at it  its still got the marks where the jockey was hitting it  youre free  parking lot attendants confirmed your alibi  so i can go  the sooner the better  and for gods sakes take a shower

with me  come on  dad just walk it off  hes not staying here he violated basic robe code  robe code violation check  look shawn theres a reason this guys on the run  hes been here ten minutes even i want to kill him  thats the problem dad how do i protect him from everybody  youve already got a suspect in jail  she was just released now we have a plethora of suspects  and no way to narrow them down  its easy tighten your focus  who does he victimize the most  is that peach cobbler in the fridge for everybody  im sorry  not today  i dont think so  i showed him  itll all go away  you think its funny  nigel  naughty  i hope you have some food in there  mr spencer mr guster im afraid i have some unfortunate news  emilina saffron was found in the bathroom  of her hotel suite this morning  she was clinging to life and has been rushed  to st thomas of the apostles  and so far all signs point to an overdose of some sort  but we are fully investigating the matter  overdose  she injected herself with enough tranquilizers  to kill an adult rhinoceros  but how did she escape  mr st nigel ms saffron was released this morning  after her alibi checked out  she is the last person that you should be worried about now  we have to cancel the show  are you kidding  look i dont want to seem insensitive but this is the third time this season  shes been in the icu  not like this  i will not go on  ill be a sitting duck out there  i will personally oversee your security detail mr st nigel  well all be out there together  youll be just fine  suck it up  now i gotta bolt im way late for my pilates  lester beacon sure didnt seem too broken up about emilina  he sure didnt  plus his hair  shawn were in a hallway  staying close to the wall doesnt make us invisible  agree to disagree  you have a plan yet  gus im a lyrical gangster  ill use some colorful vernacular  and if necessary youll engage in fisticuffs  that was close  too close  no guard  we did all that sneaking around because  you thought they put a guard at emilinas empty hotel room  seemed like a decent theory at the time  you better have the key  what are we looking for  beats me  damn  seems clean  thats what you get for drinking whole milk shawn  dude i have bones like granite  and we just got ourselves a clue  what is it  i dont know  reach in there and fish it out  im not putting my hand in there  you do it  gus i found it you get it  thats how it works  im not putting my hand in emilina saffrons toilet water shawn  jules  im getting some really serious vibrations here  theyre coming from emilinas hotel room  you gotta get us in there as soon as possible  oh and uh bring gloves  oh my god  its just as i imagined  oh i am feeling something in here  right here  did you bring the gloves  yeah i brought the gloves why do i need gloves  i feel a sparkle  that  wow shawn thats amazing  how did you know that  i feel things deeply  yeah  i need to speak with emilina right away  shes mostly comatose shawn  we probably wont know the difference  all right  dude  that crystal was on the  i know  go back to the office see if you can get some info on him  right  knock knock you have a visitor  what is spencer doing here  look i insisted  emilinas my favorite judge  i used to have such a crush on her in high school  you know before she started eating glue and whatnot  has she said anything  no  not yet  but i will be right here when she does i can tell you that  thats  very gentle  i mis judged her  she was innocent  crying out for help in her own sad  potentially diseaseridden way  i cut her off at the arms  judged the book by its filthy loathsome  wickedly erotic cover  look at me  im here baby  look  at me  i think shes trying to tell us something  that someones looking at her  i was looking at her  i should take this  get ready to be happy shawn  did you find him  i didnt just find him  i found him found him found him and found him  i knew this dude looked familiar  hes been at every stage of the competion  in every city doing his best william hung at every stop  okay lets try that again and leave out the reference  you know means nothing to me  hes singing badly on purpose shawn  knowing full well he wouldnt advance  that way he could reenter the competition  in every city at every stop  thats nefarious  but he couldnt have done this on his own  now we just have to figure out whos helping him  from the inside  emilina just said look at me from her hospital bed  how does that help us  dude  look at me  wait  tenyearold bevin rennie llywellen  what the  oh my god  what what we have a match  o theres a yellow rose of texas o  o that im going to see o  o no other soldier knows her o  o no soldier only me o o she cried so when i left her o  please accept our apologies  we just thought you all might want to know  that youre in the presence of a homicidal sociopath  no no no hes not crazy  no we got a doctors note and everything  nigel  just um dropped some items  chief so glad youre here  i know whos been trying to kill nigel  and who was trying to take out emilina  and who tried to take out emilina  mr spencer last time i checked  emilina overdosed on her own prescription medication  thats precisely what bevin rennie llywellen  wanted you to think  thats really his name  thats the wanker who auditioned in every city  just another slice of deception  the truth is he can sing like a bird  but if you heard that he wouldnt have to reaudition in every city on the tour  every city that you almost died in nigel  and after emilina was released  he tried to silence her for good  before she could put it all together  put what together  and who might this be detectives  meet bevin rennie llywellen  ms saffron woke up out of her coma  rabbitpunched me in the sternum  and remembered this guy as one of her assailants  this crystal puts him at the scene of the crime  so he made an attempt on emilinas life  allegedly poisoned a tuna salad sandwich  uh tuna nicoise salad sandwich chief  theres a difference  but what about all the other near misses with nigel  but it cant be him  its impossible  he was just a contestant  sounds like he had somebody  on the inside  he had somebody on the inside  didnt he  zzzapato  dont be ridiculous  zapato adores me  plus he cant even think  oh it has to be someone else  um how about lester  oh id love to see him in prison  bevin is zapatos biggest fan  they actually became pretty good friends  and i dont think this show turned out to be quite  the comeback either of them were hoping for  i could go on  but why dont you take the floor  zzzapato  well what could he say  he cant even speak  yes i can  but you dont let me  i was the first to sign on  this was supposed to be my show  my shot my comeback  you turned me into a simp  i freakin hate you  people dont even know who i am  i get fan letters addressed to geraldo  ricky martin and that guy from el pollo loco commercial  you ruined everything  why wont you die  really  that was your plan  that has to be the poorestexecuted attack  in history  i was two feet away from you all the time  i mean you have to be absolutely without doubt  the
