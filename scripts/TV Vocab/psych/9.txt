the past  we know each other  yes we do  i said no speaking  oh sorry  we were  classmates  yes sorry  did we ever kiss  im sorry  that image may very well be coming  from the nottoodistant future  im getting a name  connor  trish  trish connors wow  look at you  my god you look amazing  what are you doing down here  wait  why am i sensing your father  dad  yes  captain connors  it is so good to see you again sir  please come in  guys sit down in our cushy chairs  daddy you remember shawn and gus  we went to high school together  i know who they are  thats henrys boy  you dont have to speak to me  as though im a child  well  the reason that we came to see you  is that theres a uh  um  dad do you want me to hold something or  no no no not now please  oh damn it  nobody breathe  im seeing something   gus there was violence  murder   yes  there was a murder  yes exactly a murder  a oneeightseven and i solved it  you bet your ass  so what do you need us for  because damn it i cant remember whos been killed  or who the killer was  did  you go to the police  oh theyre useless all of them  without evidence they wont even speak to you  on that force  but they still refuse to believe me  when i tell them  that there was a murder and that i solved it  but im having trouble remembering  actually remembering anything  thats why im here to see if you could  maybe you could look into my head  and see what i cant find there  you believe me dont you  yes sir  i believe you  so your trish says  that this is where her father comes  every morning for his coffee  he was here  when he thought he solved the murder  so  so maybe well see something  that led an excop to believe  a murder had been committed  plus  double chocolate mango pineapple scones  apparently made fresh daily  what im saying gus  the morning is essentially a winwin  oh no  what  little is gus little is little is  we got to go what  little is what about connors  what about the double chocolate mango pineapple  forget the scones  theres only one person i know who  dont rush off on my account  dad  shawn you remember my old captain  brett connors  of course  captain connors how are you sir  look at you fellas all grown up  how longs it been huh  about a day  less actually  excuse me  yes can i help you  i dont know  my name is sabrina  vito  sabrina vito and um  i think that my boyfriend might be missing  he hasnt called  and he wont answer the phone  and im a little afraid  that something might have happened  so ive been putting these up all over town  its okay  why dont you come over here and sit down  okay  oh thats right thats right  this chick was sunbathing naked  in the plaza  no  you shouldve seen your old man  chasing her with the cuffs  this gal was so covered  with suntan oil  every time he grabbed her  she squirted right out of his hands  and that reminds me of that fiveohtwo  that we picked up  that new years eve over on olive avenue  how do you remember all this stuff  ah  its easy  like it was yesterday  speaking of yesterday captain  is this the table that you always sit at  because im getting something here  the murder  the murder  yeah yeah  you were sitting here  when you saw the victim  shawn what are you talking about  shut up henry  i solved a new murder  and your boy here is the only one who believes me  now let the kid work  im seeing a man    shaved head  yes yes  yes yes  uh his name um mifu  mifune no  m may  mick mike  his name is mike  he was arguing  over in the park  with that bastard mort crocker  a mountain lion  he pinned it on a mountain lion  now if i can just prove it  all right look  why dont i play psychic here  for a moment  it wasnt a young man  it was a young woman  shes pretty  brunette hair  nice figure   she liked to play scrabble  with her friends  her name was zoe  yeah  youre right  thats who was murdered  they said it was a mountain lion  but they were wrong  dad  youre amazing  maybe my psychic gift is hereditary  shawn  zoe sharp is a young woman  who was found dead 20 years ago  mauled by a mountain lion  connors and i worked the case  so she was murdered  she was in the wrong place at the wrong time  a tragedy yes  a murder  no  not then and not now  okay okay  lets forget zoe sharp may she rest in peace  but connors still saw the guy on the missing poster  arguing with mort crocker  in the park  what  shawn  we have no idea what connors saw or what he didnt see  the man is ill  early onset alzheimers  his mind the past the present its all screwy  its all the same to him  so he sees crocker  standing there in the park  it triggers an old memory of zoe  next thing you know hes living in the past  dad this guys your friend  he came to me for help  shawn leave him be  he doesnt need your help  to make him look like an old fool  he deserves better than that  shawn  run run  shawn what  youre going to want to see this  see what look  uh coincidence  i dont think so  so when my father said he solved a murder  you think this is the guy that was killed  well  it seems like a simple question  doesnt it trish  im afraid the answer is a bit more complicated  you see as a psychic  it is important that i elicit  the proper  im sorry  raise your hand if you want to hear  how my amazing gift works  gus youre so much better at this  why dont you uh  why dont you tell trish  how it works  ive got some some stuff i need to do  sure  the answer to your question  is yes we do believe that is the victim  so whats whats the next step  well being that the authorities believe  he was killed by a mountain lion  shawn is going to attempt to elicit a  a psychic link with the suspect  in order to establish its guilt or innocence  and by suspect you mean  the mountain lion yes  amazing not really  its fairly common for a psychic  to be able to read  different species of the animal kingdom  no no not that  what  the way that hes sitting there so  quiet  i mean in  in high school  he was always so loud  and needed attention  constantly  and needed to be noticed  and he just would not shut up  he was so annoying he drove me nuts  but now  i mean look at him  hes so calm  so unobtrusive  and the way he let you  just step in and take over like that  i think hes really matured  yeah yeah yeah  he has  dad  no no  he was mauled by a mountain lion  you dont find that the least bit coincidental  of course its coincidental shawn  but it doesnt make it murder  no it makes it an episode  of when animals attack santa barbara  yes well mountain lions  do attack in santa barbara  in fact you watch the news right  thats your source of psychic information  it happens  connors came to me  he says i solved a murder   shawn  connors was a good cop  and the thing that made him a good cop  is he never accepted the easy answer  but that doesnt mean that he was always right  obviously somewhere in his mind  hes confused something  that happened 20 years ago  with something thats happened today  okay fine  talk to me more about 20 years ago  how does zoe sharp connect to mort crocker  mort crocker founded  the morts family restaurant chain  he was the ceo  at  the time zoe sharp was his assistant  and  there was a rumor  a rumor  that they were having an affair  nice thats good stuff  and connors knew about it  of course he knew about it  every good cop makes it his job  to know about things like that  but there was never any proof shawn  no proof and even if there was  somewhere in some corner of his mind  there is a memory  a lingering memory searching for closure  but then  he sees mike here arguing with mort crocker  connors is not the most reliable witness shawn  dad hes onto something  one mountain lion two mountain lions  mountain lions  youre right  you should talk to a mountain lion  whoa  simba i am your father  i dont think mufasa said that  mufasa  vader im not rappaport  its all james earl jones  im not rappaport was ossie davis  it still works  were not even supposed to be in here  relax i love cats  and its been proven that cats love me  well this cat  likes to eat people  here kitty kitty kitty  youre not going to eat anybody  whats going on here  who authorized you to be in here  uh  please excuse us  i am dr hans jorgenson  and this is my very distinguished colleague  dr mc  tock  i wasnt expecting you until tomorrow  we have arrived early  well i am im happy youre here  im joan walker the zoo director  lets see  oh look  dr jorgenson  and dr mc  uh dr mc  tock  oh dr mc  tock  hmm  oh what  oh it is nothing  you see the xhosa language  is very difficult to master yes  it seems you have  inadvertently utter ed a vile xhosa obscenity  i am terribly sorry  dont worry  my colleague only speaks the english  at a very preschool level  and he is very forgiving of others  for instance yesterday  i poured the hot cocoa all over his genitals  and i say im sorry and its fine  now is that  the maneating lion  that we have read so much about  no no  hes not a maneater no no  if he attacked  its only because he was malnourished  so tell us why is the cat so malnourished  i really dont know  we had record rainfall this year  theres an abundance of foliage for his prey to feed on  he should be fat but  hes underweight  perhaps it is because everyone in california  is on the diet  uh all of the surfing boys  and the model girls  i mean someone anyone  please give them a sandwich  a meatball uhhuh  what is that i have no idea  cat doesnt look like its eaten in weeks  doesnt make sense  yes this is joan  well wheres dr zamfir  no no stay right there  i might have someone who can help us  it seems we have a bit of a situation  one of our warthogs is ready to give birth  but our vet is away on an emergency  could you please ask dr mc  the doctor  if as a distinguished veterinarian  he would please help us  bring a new warthog into the world  please excuse while we confer  uh  pumbaa  meerkat  uh he would be honored  yes  so just lead us the way  thank you thank you  what are you doing  we dont know anything  about delivering warthog babies  a babys a baby  you just pull it out at the right time  the real question is  are you allergic to placenta  oh god  oh my eyes  my eyes  again mr crocker thank you for coming in  i know how hectic your schedule is  dont mention it detective lassiter  im never too busy  to help santa barbaras finest  why dont you tell me what this is about  did you see this in the paper  yes i did  sad  we have information  that you were seen with the victim  the day before his body was found  no it wasnt me  why dont we just cut to the chase  it was that detective connors wasnt it  cant let it go  i really cant say  mikes body was found on this trail  its closed  now what  just hold on let me think a minute  okay i have a plan  what  dude we totally made it  were in  shawn in case youre confused  closed means go away   stay out   yes in the negative language dictionary  which is clearly the only edition you own  but in the positive language edition  closed means come in step over the chain  theres so many less people  to trample all over what youre looking for   you really think you can track the animal  perhaps youve forgotten  about my extensive experience  with the native americans  a proud and solvent people  working at the flaming tomahawk  so you do remember  shawn you were a greeter in the casino  for a week  and the only nonnative american  to be awarded an eagle feather  always remember that gus  oh please  black lab  akita  lizard  okay now youre just making stuff up  flamingo  what if we do find these mountain lion tracks  what then  well we clearly follow them  to the kill zone  and look for clues  what kill zone  what  felis concolor  its latin the mountain lion  lets follow them and see where they lead  this is it  what  the kill zone  the kill happened here  except except what  except the drag marks  are coming from that direction  the lion tracks we followed  are over there  so if this lion dragged and killed its prey  the tracks and the marks should match up  they should come from the same direction  gus you know what this means  the murder didnt happen here  exactly this cat was framed  i guess you guys cant read  what are we doing here  im burning up in this thing  no youre not yes i am  youve been wandering lost in the woods  for two nights  and youre suffering from extreme hypothermia  now shiver  howre you feeling  better  oh  ranger desoto this soup is amazing  gus called it a chowder and im tempted to agree  do you think you might have  any crackers to go with it  perhaps those little oyster kind  ill check  youre too kind  crackers really  for someone who supposedly  drinks his own urine  your palate is suddenly very sophisticated  lets get out of here  we cant  weve got work to do  i think theres more to this guntoting ranger  than meets the eye  like what  well for starters  he just happens to know the infamous mort crocker  and his wife edna  coincidence  shawn its a fundraiser  the crockers probably posed  with everybody in there  and what about the giant cage outside  what about it  i suspect that at one point  our maneating mountain lion was kept in that cage  and sustained a small cut  yeah when they trapped him and took him to the zoo  sorry  all i have is saltines  that okay  believe me when youre starving  youll eat anything  including the poop of indigenous beasts  speaking of which  when we were lost out there  gus here was littlegirl scared  that we might be eaten  by some kind of wild animal  does that sort of thing ever really happen  well its not unheard of  fact is we had a guy killed by a mountain lion  just a couple of days ago  does that kind of thing happen often  oh  a few times in the past 50 years  i thought mountain lions were afraid of humans  generally but if they get hungry enough  weve had a really dry year  that means reduced vegetation  and reduced vegetation means  fewer deer and the like  for the lions to feed on  i mean cant really blame the cat  it gets hungry and it wants to eat  you mind if i ask you a question  thats completely unrelated  sure  is that real mahogany  what do we know  and no reason for a mountain lion  to be malnourished  why was ranger desoto lying  why lie  hes hiding something  henry spencer back from lunch yet  henry spencer  im sorry who are you  never mind  just tell him to come and find me  we need to go over that zoe sharp file again  whoa excuse me sir  you cant go back there  what the hell is all this  captain connors  yeah  may i help you  this is my desk  look son i dont know who the hell you are  but youre confused  this is my desk  its been my desk for years  now you can either  help me find the zoe sharp file  or take a hike  you know what  um maybe theres someone we should call  hey look i dont have time for all this crap  i got work to do  sir please  dont make this difficult  hey  you want to dance pal you just name that tune  come on  i dont know shawn  accusing crocker of murder is a pretty big deal  it doesnt bother you were missing little things  like motive  where the murder took place  or any kind of real evidence or proof  news flash gus  the cops think im a psychic  i just have to get a feeling  at the right time  shawn gus  my father hes disappeared  hey  all right  now you are starting to piss me off old man  come here  it is time for you to go  henry  henry tell them who i am  um  i think hes talking to you  oh god please tell me  i dont look like my father  you could be his twin  look at the back of my head  is my hair starting to thin  shawn henry  uh uh  i think we all know who this is  this is captain brett connors  one of the finest cops in the sbpd  someone id be happy to share a squad car with  what the hell is going on spencer  he also happens to be my friend  now let him go  hes your responsibility  get him out of here  lets go captain  i should report them all to internal affairs  they should be brought up on charges  i couldnt agree more  you head home ill draw up the paperwork  thats the girlfriend  im sorry to disturb you  was his name mike  yeah it was  how did you know  shawn spencer police psychic  i know this must be  a very tough time for you  sabrina  sabrina  i am so sorry for your loss  you know hed come all this way  and lived so much  and his whole life can be condensed  into a few items in this box  mike wasnt from here was he  no no he was he was visiting  yeah thats right  were both from pennsylvania  mike came out here to search for his birth parents  im sensing a longing  he was so sad  the first time he called me  hed just found out  that his birth mother had been dead  for almost 20 years  and that would explain  the sadness that im feeling  but then a few days later  he called to say that he thought he had located his birth father  id never heard him more excited  did mike bring another pair of shoes with him  on this trip  no no  just what he had on him  it was pretty sudden this trip out here  i see  sabrina  im feeling that mike  does not want you to be sad  can you tell me  did mike get to meet his birth father  he said he was a really wealthy man  and difficult to get to  yes  yes he did  a biotin deficiency can be hereditary  well its not exactly a paternity test  but lets see if crocker has the same prescription  if so we know this is a fortress  we need a plan  i dont think we can exactly just ring the buzzer  and ask to peek into mr crockers medicine cabinet  why not  that sounds perfectly reasonable to me  why cant we be  from the state board of medicine cabinet inspectors  i dont know shawn  i know im right on this one  lets think this through  gus come on lets go in without a plan  flying by the seat of our pants  itd be so much more fun trust me  see look man  theres some kind  planning a party its a piece of cake  never going to notice us  excuse me  where are your badges  oh i dont need a badge  im the event planner  the event planner is a woman  yeah im her assistant  also a woman  to the assistant  im calling security  no no no you dont need to do that  dont tell me what i need to do  the rules are very strict here  really  youre going to let your bosses  run you around like that  youre going to let the man hold you down  these freak bastards  with their rules and regulations  youre a human person  you need to rise up  and tell them to go to hell  we can all do it together  let us empower you  im edna crocker  and you are one minute away  from a squad car ride  probably ought to let this one go  yeah  hi  hi  im here to pick up a prescription  for a mr crocker  mort crocker  one moment please  thank you  see  you should listen to me every once in a while  thats not fair  i dont have access  to medical files and doctors names  shawn i called two pharmacies  while you were being interrogated  i dont have anything for mr crocker  are you sure about that  yes  um  can i just get back there for a second  im sorry we dont have anything  and someone has already picked up  all of his most  recent prescriptions  was it that bastard jimmy derucci  shawn please  tell you what before i uh  before i go a little nuts  why dont you uh  just give me the name of the prescriptions  and we can get out of here  okay okay see  its a longstanding prescription  it needs to be renewed  no ones going to go nuts here  okay no i  i do have something  but they did  they picked that up over two months ago  really  what was that the penicillin  no it was his regular dosage of something called  biotin  yes  is that what youre looking for  yesthank you  all right spencer  you said you found an eyewitness  for mike mcmillans murder  where is he  okay mike  go ahead  tell the detectives exactly what you told me  youre kidding me right  and were out of here  mike says he was in town  searching for his natural birth parents  if you dont believe him  you can ask his girlfriend  thats true she told me  did she also tell you  that he found his birth father  well what about his birth mother  did mike say if he found her  no no he didnt say anything  see he cant  hes a picture on a piece of paper  and dead  you should be ashamed of yourself  mike said his mother was killed   right after he was born  her name was zoe sharp  i knew it  that son of a bitch  he killed her and now he got rid of the baby  he protects his business his reputation  and he doesnt have to share his wealth  sounds like a motive for murder to me  really  yep  then how do you explain the mountain lions huh  if youre so smart how do you explain that  uh  lassie why are you asking him  he was just a baby  when his mother was killed  in fact he wasnt even there  summer of 86  was hot and dry  there were a lot of fires  the lions were all going hungry  i remember some of them came right into town  looking for food  crocker killed zoe  and dumped her body in the hills  he didnt know about the lions  that just happened  they ate the evidence and covered his tracks  he just got lucky  what about this time with mike  what he just got lucky again  no not this time  this time he had help  ranger desoup desoto  desoto provided the lion  desoto i know that name  i just cant remember why  sir its okay  well i got to hand it to you  this is a terrific story  theres just one problem  im sure its nothing  that mike cant help us work through  what is it crocker has an airtight alibi  he was in chicago when mike was killed  oh hes lying  i checked it out myself sir  he spoke at a symposium  in front of 200 other people  no no not again  not this time  dad  sir  daddy  he wouldnt do anything
