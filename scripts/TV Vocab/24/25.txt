branches of the military some fbi and the cia  mr president ive called mike novick hes getting on a plane right away  good thank you   gentlemen lynne  morning mr president  what im about to tell you mr president is triplesourced  while crucial details are still unknown we believe this intel to have high credibility  go on  theres a nuclear device under terrorist control thats on us soil  my god   where  los angeles  it gets worse this bomb is going to go off today  how do we know this  this suicide bomber is mamud rashed faheen  a suspected terrorist who we believe has been associated with fundamentalist groups  this is the valentines day bombing in the west bank  this particular attack resulted in 13 fatalities 26 injured  we discovered that the secondary purpose of this incident  was to create the impression faheen was killed   he wasnt  no  this was taken five days ago at a small airport outside lon france  we had the man on the left jason park under surveillance  it was just a coincidence that we caught the very much alive faheen in the photo  we grabbed park and tried to extract everything we could out of him  and confessed that for the last two years  faheen has been preparing for todays attack on los angeles  why didnt you pick up faheen  this picture wasnt analyzed until after the two had separated  ive contacted defense cia fbi and local jurisdictions   everything will be run through nsa  who controls faheen  relatively new splinter group that goes by the name of second wave  government affiliation  officially not recognised by any middle eastern state  unofficially   get me their prime minister  right away  gary your breakfast is ready dont let it get cold  ill be right there  i wont be back till this afternoon im expecting a package keep an eye out for it  sure   mom im going skateboarding  and what does that mean  i know  i have to put on my helmet and my elbow and knee pads  and stay close to kim   love you  what about kim  shes the

a great body  you work out  not really i like to swim  yes  i have the prime minister on the phone for you   mr prime minister  mr president  i was told you need to speak to me  what can you tell me about a terrorist organisation known as second wave  ive heard of them but my government firmly rejects its tenets and its methods  in fact weve recently arrested several of its members  how do you account for three second wave camps operating unimpeded in your country  there are no camps in my country  mr prime minister i know two things  one second wave is planning an attack against one of my cities today  two your government supports second wave  i would appreciate it if you would stop using my people and my country  as a source for every threat levelled at the united states  what im saying is not meant to be a threat simply a statement of fact  if a bomb goes off on us soil today  i will have no choice but to retaliate  with immediate and decisive force against your government  this is an insult  we are not planning to attack the united states  insult or not  if you care about the lives of your citizens you need to hear me loud and clear  mr prime minister if a bomb goes off today it will hurt us  but it will destroy you  then mr president  you will have created an enemy of over one third of the worlds population  proceed carefully  you as well sir   you wanna try it again  yeah  dont fall you can do it though  all right slow   yeah  mr bauer   who is this  i have george mason from ctu on the line   i dont work for ctu any more  he said that  im in the middle of something right now thank you  im so proud of you you did so good   is there any blood  let me see  no no blood youre perfect  ok i wanna go again   all right lets go tough guy  hey im not a guy  you know what why dont you go play in the back yard ill meet you there  see you in a bit  hey sweetheart   dad what are you doing here  i just wanted to say hi  you havent been returning my calls  im sorry  i didnt come to ask you for lunch or hang out  i know you just started this job but i just wanted to see you i miss you  i know i miss you too   then why wont you  every time i see you i think

to see me  yes this report seems to be missing a casualty assessment  im having those figures compiled right now theyll be ready in about 10 minutes   thank you eric  mr president if i may  i think you need to have a serious conversation with the pentagon  they need to know how to proceed  its too early to discuss a response  we dont even know who to retaliate against   you know the prime minister was lying  he was lying about the terrorist camps  but that doesnt mean his government is responsible for this threat   mr president i think  eric enough  right now my only concern is protecting americans  somewhere in los angeles there is a terrorist with his finger on the trigger  weve got to get him   good morning  hi sweetheart  hey you two cut it out  what i cant kiss my own

beep  hi jack its tony almeida at ctu  ive left messages for you everywhere could you please give us a call  its very important  this is jack bauer leave your message after the beep  hello mr bauer im calling on behalf of president palmer  the president needs to speak to you on an urgent matter please call us back   hello  mr bauer please hold for the president  sir i have jack bauer   jack  mr president  youve been avoiding ctus calls this morning   i dont work for them any more sir  so i hear  hows it all going jack   its been difficult sir  im sure it has   ive thought a lot about you this past year  thank you mr president  i know this is a bad time but i need your help  ive been inactive for over a year i cant see how id be of any help to anyone  we are in a grave situation that requires the attention  of all branches of our national security  my advisors are convinced that you can play an important part in this effort   im sorry but im in no condition  jack listen to me  i know you suffered a loss i know its hard but this is not a routine request  go to ctu  listen to whats happening and then make your decision  jack  you saved my life  i trust you as much as i trust anyone and now i need your help  when do they need me  now  carla whyd you come back  i was supposed to wrap a gift for gary to take to his assistant today   i can do it  no i have to do it  why  because gary likes these things done in a very specific way  it would take too long to explain it  ok  kim  im sorry  will you take megan upstairs to play  sure  have you looked at your system  no whats up  langley issued an information flow advisory whatevers going on will be interagency  all right call lindauer and grothy and tell them they dont have a day off after all  and start filtering anything that comes in  hey   somethings going on isnt it  were not sure   i could do those redundancies  its ok   ive studied the protocols  paula youre trying too hard  just do your job everythings gonna be fine  sorry i waited to get assigned here for two years i just  heads up i need all department heads over here right now  weve an active priority  i just got off a conference call with nsa and division  it appears theres a nuclear bomb under terrorist control  somewhere here in los angeles set to go off at some point in the course of the day so  from this moment on  we do not communicate with anybody outside of our secured envelope  that means we dont call home we dont talk to friends we dont call relatives  our job is to find this device and stop it  we do not want to create panic  i know this isnt very pleasant  but this is our job this is what we do  so lets do it  george   i still havent been able to reach jack  nsa got hold of him  is this why they wanted him i mean hes been out of play for over a year  im guessing it has something to do with one of his previous covers  in this scenario immediate loss of life would be in the low thousands relatively small  but the dispersal of radioactive debris from a dirty bomb is unpredictable  and could multiply that figure many times over  i understand that we dont know whether this is a dirty bomb or something bigger  give me the worstcase scenario  all right worstcase scenario  stolen soviet nuclear warhead  a properly configured trigger detonated 500 feet above the city  approximately 100 square miles would be irradiated within seconds  apart from the loss of life this kind of blow would have global repercussions  that would last for years  thank you eric  what would you like to do about the joint chiefs sir theyre waiting to hear from you  im not ready to speak to them yet  mr president if i could suggest that you at least start the dialogue  at this point this is not a military operation  it is a potential terrorist attack and thats the way im going to approach it  yes sir  thank you everybody  paula i need you to open up another socket for me  and mason wants to see you in the conference room  paula   i dont know if i can do this  of course you can do it  no im just a programmer and i dont think i work very well under this kind of pressure  so maybe they just wanna bring somebody else in  look paula there is no one else  youre the best at what you do you know the system inside out thats why youre here  just take it one task at a time  right now all i need you to do is open up a couple of sockets  and then get to the conference room all right  ok  ok  thank you  hey jack   hi tony how you doing  fine how you been  ive been all right wheres george  hes waiting for you in the conference room   youve been briefed  yeah  jack   jack bauer michelle dessler  what am i doing here george  theres a rogue nuclear weapon here in los angeles jack  intel says its going off today

maybe theres another way to find wald  why didnt i think of that i bet nsa had us bring in a burntout agent for the challenge   anyone could have done the job  settle down george all right  lets sit down regroup and figure out what were gonna do  what were gonna do were gonna call nsa now  heres the deal i want knoll or grothy to pick up my daughter  and take her a safe distance outside of this

 thanks   hello  this is ralph burton is this a bad time  no ralph can you hold on a second  sorry ralph whats up didnt you get my cheque  yes thats not why im calling  when you asked for a background on reza naiyeer  you were worried about his financial integrity  the report you showed me said i had nothing to worry about has something changed  not exactly hes done nothing wrong at your fathers company  and his financial dealings in the past have been legitimate  great so whats the problem  i was proofing a file on another individual   rezas name came up  yeah so  theres a man named syed ali hes an international financier  with ties to several terrorist organisations  what are you saying reza knows this guy ali  well according to this file theyve had dealings  oh my god  its possible that rezas business with ali was legitimate  that reza didnt even know about alis terrorist connection  but if you wanna know for sure im gonna need your help  what do you need me to do  lets not waste time i dont want my decisions based on speculation  before i read any of the reports i want the sources and their reliability doublechecked  excuse me  did you set up a comm with the joint chiefs
