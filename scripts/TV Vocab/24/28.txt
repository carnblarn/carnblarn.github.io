 well the sooner the better  look the truth is i may not be coming back   why not  im not in a position to help out right now  what are you talking about look a nuclear device is set to go off some time today in la  we lost half the people who couldve stopped it so stop trying to cover your own ass  just deal with it tony ok just deal with it all right  yeah right  jack you come with me  all

that son of a bitch  tony almeidas line   whos this  michelle dressler  this is jack bauer whats going on  there was an explosion 20 minutes ago   why wasnt ctu evacuated  there wasnt any time  what do you mean there wasnt enough time is mason all right  he wasnt here   how about tony almeida  hes helping the rescue workers   fine can you handle a situation report  yeah  ok go ahead  ive located joseph wald im on my way there now   what about walds crew  theyre all dead  dead  just let mason know im on my way to walds house  the address is 221 canyon view road in simi valley  ok iii send backup  ok oh michelle let mason know i talked to kim she is leaving the city   she called here too and she spoke to tony  she did what did she say   im not sure but ill look into it  ok get backto me thanks  paula paula  is she ok  tony  whats up   just got off the phone with jack bauer  where is he  on his way to see wald he wanted mason to know  well masons checked out just get the information directly to nsa  and he asked about his daughter kim   oh oh no  what  she was on her way here can you checkthe security logs see if she was in the building  thanks   is megan all right  she will be  her seizure was caused by pressure on the brain compounded by a skull fracture  but she wasnt injured in the explosion  i know from what ive seen her head injury most likely occurred before the blast  shes had prior injuries  a fractured wrist several fingers that were never treated  what are you saying  these injuries suggest a possible pattern of physical abuse  you dont think i did this you dont think i hurt her  im gonna let the police sort that out  bill theyre limiting access all we know is that a short time ago  a major explosion ripped through this government building in los angeles  no statement has been issued about the cause of the explosion  although early speculation has included rumours of terrorist involvement  as far as im concerned this tips in favour of evacuation  i assume youve all read erics report recommending the evacuation of la  the ctu bombing is just the beginning  its only a matter of time before the questions become rumours  and the rumours set off a mass panic  wouldnt the evacuation itself cause panic  we can do this discreetly weve prepared cover stories  thats a tough sell for nine million people  general preston assures me that the military can contain any civilian unrest  contain sounds like a euphemism not to mention the constitutional issues  i dont claim thisll be a cakewalk  theres also a practical issue not being addressed here  whats that lynne  our intelligence is specific about this nuclear device being detonated today  your report says it would take at least one week for this evacuation  its my job to protect as many citizens of the united states as i can  if i get even 20of the population outside the blast radius thats a win  we dont know where the bomb is where do we begin the evacuation  my staff has ranked ten high probability target areas  thats not good enough  look i realise youve only had a short time to prepare this  but i have some real reservations  bottom line mr president it protects you politically if the bomb goes off  if the bomb goes off well have more important concerns than my reelection  do you have anything else to add  no sir  then were done until we have reliable intelligence about where the bomb is located  there will be no evacuation  let general davenlos know im ready for him and conference in ted and elyse  yes sir  this is jack bauer i need to speakto the president urgently  operator one moment please mr bauer  i need you to confirm these reports and get them on novicks desk   lynne kresge  i have jack bauer on line eight   he insists on speaking to the president  put him through please   mr bauer this is lynne kresge  i asked to speakto the president  im sorry hes unavailable perhaps i can help  what the hell are you doing  i gave you a 30minute warning before that building was hit  you had time to evacuate  there were extenuating circumstances  i did try to tell the president  its more complicated than im able to explain at this time   thats not good enough  its all i can offer you   ms kresge right  yes  youre responsible for killing innocent people friends of mine  right now you are the best chance we have of intercepting that nuclear weapon   so i suggestyou do your job  ill do my job  you people better start doing yours  dad   i need to talkto you its important  sure sure honey just a second  this weddings gonna break me  so whats the big emergency  last month i was going over the p and ls and i found some inconsistencies  if this is business well deal with this on monday   dad its about reza  what about reza  i thought he might have been responsible for the missing money  so i hired an investigator to do an audit   you hired someone to spy on reza  i thought he was stealing from you  and is he  no but something else came up something a lot worse  come on  reza may be involved with a terrorist  what  apparently hes been in contact with someone who finances terrorist operations  a man named syed ali   what kind of proof does he have  im not sure  youre not sure  he only called me an hour ago he told me not to tell anyone but i had to tell you  whatever this investigator found theres an explanation for it  you hire a man to dig up dirt hes gonna dig up dirt  thats howthese guys stay in business   what if youre wrong  im not  how do you know  because i had reza checked out myself  and a lot more thoroughly than the guy you hired  kate reza is not a terrorist  look i am a businessman kate a damn good one  my daughters are my most precious assets  i wouldnt let either one of you get married without performing a due diligence  now i wantyou to drop this nonsense and start treating him like a member of the family   hey guys  hey  i think my cousins got a little crush on you kate  he wouldnt stop talking aboutyou   he seems nice  yeah he is  well i promised marie id pick up lunch id better get going   let me take you  its ok i can handle it  when you see how much shes ordered youll need another pair of hands  really i can do it  kate  go  radio mobile 3 this is dispatch  this is mobile 3  i have tony almeida at ctu for george mason   sir  yeah i heard   tony  george  i told you to handle this yourself  if i didnt have to talkto you again id be happy  but it need to access the data stream paula was working on  its on your system we need your password   my password  yeah  hendrix   thats

good ill speakto you soon byebye  sir this is jennys statement to the press about the ctu bombing  i took a quick pass but we can go over it whenever you get a chance all right  were you ever gonna tell me  about the 30 minutes after jack bauer called and the time you finally warned ctu  lynne i am the president of the united states  did you really think i wouldnt find out  what reason could you have had for keeping this information from me   sir i tried to tell you  not hard enough  sir when jack bauer called you were with the press i tried to get a message to you  good now after we found out that ctu had been hit  you still kept from me the fact thatyou knew 30 minutes earlier  sir youre right theres no excuse  none  after jack bauer called did you tell anyone else  you told rayburn didntyou  and he was the one that wanted you to keep it from me  thats why you two were arguing earlier  sir i think under the circumstances it would be best if i tendered my resignation  ill decide whats best  yes of course sir  as much as i appreciate the gesture  i dont have time to appease your guilty conscience  but i still trustyou lynne  and i trustyoull tell me everything that happened  whats going on why is she here   why is paula still here  its masons call  she has almost no chance if we dont get her to a hospital now  yeah i know   i thought mason wasnt even coming back  hes back  hes trying to revive paula long enough to access the information she was sending nsa  so hes just gonna let her die  im not so sure mason made the wrong call  i mean paula is the only person that can retrieve that information  im sorry  im sorry tony  its just im the one that brought her to ctu  i hired her  this job is all she ever wanted to do  she never even got a chance to do it  she did  wed
