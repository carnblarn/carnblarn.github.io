information unless i brought you to him   who is this man  i dont know  thats the problem kate i dont know who he is   what would he want with me  weve gotta find out  if i can provide concrete proof that the cyprus recording was fake we can stop a war  i will do what i can to protect you but you have to decide now  you have to decide whether or not you want to accept the risk  do you really think we can do this  im not gonna lie to you this is very very dangerous  im sorry i dont know what else to do im running out of time   did they stop him  he drove through the gate   whats the problem  my

a firstaid kit   you said jack took kate with him  yeah   i dont think he was working alone  what do you mean  baker was keeping an eye on kate michelle distracted him just before i found you   distracted him how  she called him away on paperwork  that doesnt mean they were working together  i think it does michelle was talking to jack right before she went to baker   he might have been setting her up  it didnt appear that way  the vice presidents ready for your call sir   whens he meet the british ambassador  right after he speaks with you  the vice president will want you to authorise him  to inform the ambassador of our deployment   he told you that  you know where jim stands on this  hell want to let everyone know were on a war footing especially the british  whats your position sir  once we bring our allies in on this itll make it much harder to recall those planes   put him through  the president is ready to speak with him   right away  thank you  hello jim  whats the british reaction to the bombing  everyone is stunned their military is on high alert   the british ambassador  hes waiting to hear from us  after this conversation im free to inform him about the stealth bombers  not just yet jim its still premature  those planes are due to drop their payloads in a little over four hours  were holding off notifying our allies  because theres a possibility we may not go through with the attack  i dont understand  i have reason to believe the cyprus audio implicating  the target countries was fabricated   i thought we proved it was real  as did i  ctu la is in the process of obtaining intelligence that may show otherwise  in the process   meaning they dont have any proof yet  correct  did you run it by cia did they have any indication this things a fraud  not as of yet  mr president you authorised this military action and justifiably so  with all due respect its too late for second thoughts  we will not start a war on false or incomplete information   say nothing to the ambassador  yes mr president  mr president i know you trust jack bauer implicitly  but to equivocate our response in a matter of this importance  because of one mans reservations makes me very uncomfortable  im afraid im with mike on this one sir  noted  this is deputy raynes mr garcia we have officers surrounding the building  your only option is to throw your weapon out  and come out with your hands on your head  stay with me no no  i cant stop the bleeding we need to get him to a hospital   please dont let him die  we need you to respond  you need to talk to the police tell them youll give up   we gotta let them in here right now  no i didnt mean for this to happen  a bomb went off theres gonna be a war i was just trying to protect my wife   shes pregnant  i will

who i can trust  i saw you take out tony whos in charge you dont want your country to invade mine  my agenda is not to help your country my responsibility is to make sure the president   makes his decisions based on fact  my countrys not responsible  maybe but ali is a citizen of your country he runs his terrorist network from there  yes which means hes a criminal to my government just as much as yours  why would my country deliberately provoke an attack that would decimate us  we have everything to lose nothing to gain  what do you want  when you broke out you isolated yourself youll need help   tony  yeah   what did the doctor say  i dont know they think i tore a ligament  look carrie told me that she saw you talking to jack  right before he took kate warner out of ctu   yeah is that a problem  it depends what you were talking about  what were you talking about  are you interrogating me  did you help jack take kate warner out of here  of course not  is that what carrie told you im in collusion with jack   yeah  i dont know what to tell you  she doesnt know what shes talking about  look michelle  it doesnt matter whether you think jack is right or wrong  the fact is this is my command and what happens here is my responsibility   i know that  so i need you to be honest with me now  did you intentionally draw agent baker away from kate warner  no i did not   so why would carrie tell me you did  because shed like to see me out of here   and whys that  because i dont like her and she knows it   you wanna tell me about it  no not really   if its interfering with your

presidents back  that is so dangerous  if i can get some concrete information i can support the president more effectively  and if you cant  then ill have the conviction to talk him through the situation im in the dark   im not sure  lynne lynne this is my call  your recommendation not to go around the president is duly noted  thanks  mr almeida mike novick the presidents chief of staff is on the line   mr novick this is tony almeida  hi tony i need to reach jack bauer  yeah well were trying to locate him ourselves sir  what do you mean whats the problem  jack was here earlier debriefing from the days events  when he grabbed a material witness and took her off the premises illegally   he also assaulted ctu personnel  why would he do that  jacks working on a hunch that the cyprus recording was fabricated  this is what i wanted to talk to him about  the president is not giving his complete support  to the military action until he hears from bauer   i understand sir  now what about the witness hes taken   how does that factor in  her name is kate warner  her sister was involved with the second wave terrorists  were trying to connect the dots thats the other reason we need to find jack  the second you make contact with bauer you put him through to me were at district  yes sir   turner  carrie   whats up  yeah i need to see you  yeah  yes tony   where are we on jack

from ctu and assaulted an agent in the process  i know how much this country owes him sir  but hes obviously suffered some kind of emotional collapse  it would be understandable given everything hes been through  but we dont know that  what he did might have been necessary under the circumstances  we already have incontrovertible proof from langley  that the cyprus recording is authentic  finding jack bauer isnt going to change that  the country needs your energy and attention on what happens after those bombs drop  we need to prepare for this war  if this recordings not authentic and jack bauer turns out to be right  itd be a mistake of historic proportions   mr president  thats all mike  find jack bauer  shell be here any minute wheres the evidence  ok heres how its gonna go down  i take kate with me she sets up the plane it picks us up at an airport of my choosing  when im on that plane ill call and tell you where the evidence is  what assurances do i have youll even call  none

medical  medical team go   thank you  all right   we ready  yes we are mike  mr vice president youre on with me and lynne  because the president is being briefed by ryan chappelle  he asked that we go ahead without him   fine  how did it go with the british ambassador  not well he knows that were planning a retaliation against the middle east  but hes frustrated cos were not coordinating with them  im sure hell understand once he gets the facts  what are the facts mike  weve got planes in the air either were committed or were not  if the evidence shows that the cyprus recording was falsified  the president wants the option of calling those planes back  you know what it sounds like to me an excuse to call this off  do you believe the presidents capable of doing the hard thing mike  the right thing  yes sir i do  hes committed to this action all hes doing is making sure every base is covered  i hope so  the president will be contacting you as soon as anything develops  all right mike  mike  you think the vice president is right dont you  if the president turns those planes around  based on the unconfirmed speculation of a single ctu agent  itll be a disaster  so what do we do about it  i dont know   where are you taking me  get in  im not gonna try and escape   i said get in  kate get in the trunk for your own safety   the trackers in place its been activated  good  jack its been a real pleasure  ill be in touch
