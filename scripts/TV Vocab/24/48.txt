mike  its important  excuse me  what is it  its a file on peter kingsley they pulled it up a few minutes ago  peter kingsley the man jack bauer thinks is behind the bomb  theres a record of phone calls he made as recently as six hours ago  to a soldier named jonathan wallace  wallace was a member of the coral snake brigade  he apparently killed his own men  i know who wallace is  the planes have passed over their final checkpoint  and will reach their targets within the hour  our primary targets are all military  but one includes a commandandcontrol centre inside a residential area  as smart as our weapons have become there may be some collateral damage  you mean civilian casualties  yes sir   theres no way to avoid these  im afraid not  then its something were just gonna have to live with  ryan chappelle   ryan this is mike novick  how can i help you sir  i know theres been some confusion today about the veracity of the cyprus audio  not really our teams came to the same conclusion as langley  do you know if bauers still trying to find evidence that the recording was fabricated  yes but hes operating outside our authority  i want you to assist his investigation   sir i dont even know where he is  then find him  im not sure why youre asking me to do this  i was told were at war and to proceed accordingly  were not at war yet you have 30 minutes to report back to me  the findings of bauer and your efforts   but sir  thats a direct order ryan  you have my channel call me back on this line thats all   ill be on the plane in an hour  why the delay  the bomb detonating in the wrong location created a little extra work  nothing to worry about i hope  not at all i wont bore you with the details  bore me  i still have to take care of alex hewitt  hewitt is the only one who can bring this whole thing down   you told me youd have him by now  i wasnt able to find him  but im taking care of it dont worry  sit down both of you  you dont need michelle here she was acting under my orders   i can defend myself tony  i said sit down  i need you to get me in contact with jack bauer  oh i see jack got some support above you and now youre being squeezed right

charges against us  and well help you  come on ryan you of all people know thats your best move   fine  in writing  all right in writing just get me in touch with bauer   shouldnt we call for help  im

they forced you to do it that they brainwashed you that they threatened you  you can tell me that you didnt know what you were doin  there must be a reason  there is no reason dad  i cant accept that  i couldnt either  until i looked into her eyes and she pointed a gun at me and started to pull the trigger  trust me dad  shes not gonna give you any answers  she cant at least nothing that we could

responsible  listen things have changed  you got full support give me your mission profile  ive set up a meeting with kingsley  were gonna meet him at the la coliseum gate 18  mrs palmer will wear a wire and make him confirm  that the three countries had nothing to do with the nuke  stand down until you get some support our people will be there soon  we dont have time kingsleys expecting the meet to go down now  you need backup  if you wanna help me get me voice prints of kingsley and mrs palmer for authentication  done   and a live audio feed to the white house  you want an audience with the president  yes  all right keep the line clear   copy were pulling into the coliseum now  we need to get a swat team to his location  pull over there  wait here for me  come on  lets get you wired  take your jacket off your shoulder  this is a wireless transmitter  they wont know to look for it they wont be able to trace it   this is crazy we shouldnt do this alone  we dont have another choice  remember kingsley doesnt want to leave here without hewitt  thats gotta be to our advantage  ok say something  im scared  ok its working   yes mike  mr president  i am against any delay in our military actions i have been from the start  but there is a good chance well receive evidence soon the cyprus recording is false  we know second wave brought the nuke into the country  and we know theyre sponsored by these three countries what am i missing  i dont have all the details but i just learned about a possible link  between second wave and a man named peter kingsley  who is he  hes apparently part of a consortium of oil interests with contracts in the caspian sea  an oil consortiums behind the nuke  bauer believes he can get a confession from kingsley hes set up a live audio feed  our bombers are due to drop their payloads in less than 20 minutes  bauers meeting kingsley any minute  this is the live voice print  and this is the voice file we have on record  which will prove that it is in fact sherry palmer   its confirmed  the one below is kingsley   yeah  are you guys getting this   were good here  how far out is our backup   theyre 11 minutes out  thats too long weve gotta go now   just wait  we cant  were already ten minutes past the meeting time is prescott ready  tonys on with the white house theyre setting up a live audio feed  ok good we are set to go  how are you doing mrs palmer  whats to prevent kingsley from shooting me  he wont do anything until he gets hewitt  but the moment he realises we dont have hewitt  ill be covering your back  thats not very comforting considering the condition youre in  i may not make it out of this  im not gonna lie to you mrs palmer thats a possibility  im doing this for david you know that dont you  yes  will you tell him that in case something happens  ill take care of it mrs palmer youve gotta go now   mike  yes sir  we just finished setting up the feed i hope this isnt gonna be a waste of our time  believe me mr president so do i  whats going on mike  the president and i thought you should be part of this  along with prescott and the attorney general we will be listening to a live feed   of what  a sting operation against peter kingsley  it appears he was the architect of todays bombing  and the delivery of the cyprus audio   bauer found kingsley  yes  but it wont be bauer wholl be talking to kingsley  what difference does it make as long as we get him to incriminate himself  what is it mike  its sherry wholl be talking to kingsley  i dont understand  it seems that kingsley recruited her some months ago  she was part of this  sherry was working with this man kingsley  it appears that way sir  to detonate a nuclear bomb and start a war  no  its unclear how much she knew or how deep she was in it  we just have to hope she can extract a confession from kingsley  so now sherry is working with jack bauer to bring down kingsley  yes and at considerable risk to herself  scott dont do anything until i tell you to   we need hewitt  understood   wheres hewitt  hes safe  where is he  you lied to me you wanted this bomb to go off all along  you used roger stanton and you used me  yes i did  well now im tied to you and the nuclear detonation i want safe haven   thats your problem  well i just made it yours  because you wont see hewitt until im safe   dont horse trade with me  dont insult my intelligence   we got a match on kingsleys voice  ryan you got it  youre not going anywhere till i have hewitt  that doesnt work for me  ill call you on this line to give you hewitts location after im safely away  you dont need to know where im going   were not getting what we need here  shell get it for you   now theres the matter of the recordings  theyre right here  every phone conversation between you and me  no i want all of them including cyprus  why cyprus you had nothing to do with that   insurance  insurance  once the country goes to war the government will never let that be exposed  hewitt is the only one who can hurt us   because he forged the cyprus recording  right   you got your proof let me go ahead  get it confirmed from the white house   she cant stay much longer  are you satisfied  ctu wants to know if thats enough to prove it  have you confirmed this is live and the voices have been authenticated  yes sir   so thats it  yes  when i land ill call you  hm  youre bluffin you dont have hewitt do you   oh yes i do  no you dont  scott take her out  kill her  run sherry  come on come on  mrs palmer get out of here go  jack bauer  youve caused me a lot of trouble today jack  youre not gonna give me hewitt are you  our bombers are three minutes from the targets  initiating sequence six one tango one  target in view weapons lock  are we go for a strike  are we go for a launch  we are awaiting command  abort the attack  abort abort  what do you mean kingsleys dead how could that happen  i warned you not to use him  so we did use him and he failed  but it wont matter once the war starts well be ok   it isnt going to start  whys that  the president found out about the cyprus recording and called off the attack  there isnt going to be any war max  well were going to have to do this another way   another way what are you talking about  youll find out  itll start today  its me go ahead  the cabinet has annulled its earlier action  i have instructed the secret service to resume its charge of serving you  as president of the united states  i see  ive also tendered my resignation effective immediately  and those members of the cabinet who voted against you have also agreed to resign  jim  gentlemen ladies  we came dangerously close to war today  that all of us reacted emotionally to the nuclear detonation is understandable  but leaders are required to have patience beyond human limits  the kind of action we nearly took should only be exercised  after all other avenues have been exhausted  after the strictest standard of proof has been met  by casting me aside so quickly you effectively lowered those standards  and that was a profound mistake  it was not however a mistake youre likely to make again  therefore i do not accept your resignations  we have a nation to heal today  and all of you play a vital role in that healing process  mr president  i dont know what to say  theres nothing to say  we have work to do  thatll be all   jenny set up a press conference  when  as soon as you can and i want it public  i want to speak to the people directly they deserve my assurance  yes sir  mike i wanna thank you again for calling ctu in the 11th hour  of course mr president  but you should have been with me to the end  thats what i expected of you  thats why i appointed you  im relieving you of your post effective immediately  yes mr president  thank you sir i cant take all the credit myself  its a great team george mason put together here  yes i will thank you sir  tony that was district director vaughn  hes so happy with what we did here today he doesnt know where to start  thats great  so whats up my friend  well um  its like this  either fire me  or get out of my chair  the chairs all yours   hey  hey  the new shift is here theyve been brought up to speed  i was thinking id get my brother and go home  michelle um  theres a handful of people who made a big difference today  youre one ofem  you made some tough choices and went up against me you were right  thanks  so um why dont you go home and get some rest  michelle  see you tomorrow   ill need to see the contents of your bag  im kate warner and this is kim bauer  excuse me   hey honey  daddy  its gonna be all right  i know  i love you  i love you too  dad im gonna take care of you  i urge you in the strongest terms  not to indulge any rumours or theories that you may have heard or may soon hear  once the facts are known i will present them to you myself  until then know that we are all safe and that we will continue to be safe  the most patriotic thing that we can all do today is to keep living our lives  so i urge you all go back to work go back to school  because the freedom we enjoy the freedom that we earn every day  is the very thing that will defeat our enemies and keep us strong  god bless america  god bless us all thank you  thank you very much god bless you  thank you thank you  thank you good to see you  thank you
