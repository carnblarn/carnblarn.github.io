                roger its good to see you  id like to talk to you about this meeting i dont trust the ambassador  its possible that his countrys supporting second wave  we want to prevent this incident  we need access to your files  i want you to monitor how they use our intel  its the ambassadors chopper it crashed just after takeoff   theres a man who needs to talk to you  who is he  hes from the counter terrorism agency  i told you i do not know a syed ali  then how do you explain that his name is in your personal computer files  theres a nuclear bomb in los angeles do what i tell you go now  miguel get over here  theres a nuclear bomb in the city   lets get outta here  not without megan  george i got to wald i found out who commissioned him to take out ctu   who was it  it was nina myers  nina  nina killed your wife i dont want you near her  i have to grant her a shadow asylum  that sounds like a pardon sir  she has information that could help us find this bomb   what is it  theyre gonna let her go  i know you were exposed to high levels of radioactive materials this morning  i wanna know what your plans are for nina i want the case i know how she thinks  if you dont do this ill tell district about your condition theyll replace you  palmer just signed the pardon so as soon as it gets here well start the interrogation   ninas file  i dont need it  the presidents here  mr president  mr president can you give us any details about the helicopter crash   who was on the aircraft any survivors  is it related to the bombing in la  we cant disclose information about the crash  until the families of the victims have been notified  but i promise you there will be a careful and thorough investigation   mr president  lets go  we will be putting out a formal statement as soon as we get those issues resolved  and i ask everyone to refrain from speculation until that time  no one besides jenny releases a statement on the crash  no names no speculation and keep the lid on tight  absolutely sir  hello david  how did you get in here without my authorisation  we were married for many years many people respect that even if you dont  i need to talk to you  we have nothing more to talk about youre not my wife any more   its not about us  then what  not here i need to be alone with you  you know what  even if i were interested in what you had to say today is impossible  you shouldnt have come here   its about your administration  what about it   just give me five minutes  i dont have time now  did you order an evacuation of military personnel out of los angeles  who told you that  five minutes david  wait here  ill call you  do we know about the military moving personnel out of la  no sir you specifically requested there be no evacuation   check into it  i certainly will  youre doing business with a known terrorist  and you sit there with a straight face and tell me you dont know whats going on  i grew up in london im marrying an american girl a protestant  so if youre going to racially profile me  you should at least get it right  our main targets are european muslims  with western educations passports  and the potential to blend into western society  so tell me reza hows my racial profiling going now  i want a lawyer  no   did they find the black box yet  not yet mr president  how could something like this happen  i dont know ive opened a multiagency investigation ntsb is on the way  lynne schedule a call with the prime minister   yes sir  i wanna talk to him before rumours start  but im afraid they may not be far from the truth this was not an accident  im thinking along the same lines mr president  the prime minister may not have been happy about the ambassadors cooperation with us  theres another possibility roger  im not following you sir   that we did it  correct  that hardly seems likely  the ambassador took classified information back to his government   you both thought it was questionable  and if we were talking about it here  you can bet there are others back in dc who feel even more strongly  set up an independent investigator lets find out exactly who was in the loop  yes sir  ok this is it here we go  ill show her this ill let her start talking  then ill get you the stuff she doesnt want us to know  the last time i let you interrogate somebody you shot him through the heart  im letting you do this but i hope im not making a mistake  no mistake george  all right good luck  lets keep this simple  if you wanna stop the bomb i need to be on a plane to visalia now  did you pick visalia for a reason or would anywhere outside the blast zone work   my contact is in visalia  who is it  the only person who can tell us where the bomb is  im not gonna tell you who it is till we get there  fine then you can sit here and wait for the blast to hit  stop wasting time i have the presidents signature  im here hes not  and im not gonna make a move until i believe youre credible  ill only get the pardon if i stop the bomb why wouldnt i do everything i can  because youre worse than a traitor nina  you dont have a cause you dont believe in anything  but you would sell anyone out to the highest bidder  so stop wasting my time gimme a name  dont even bother jack  if you lay a hand on me youll be taken off the case  youre just gonna have to follow my lead  tell me everything i wanna know  or i swear to god i will hurt you before i kill you and no one will stop me   do you understand  jack let her go now   all right youre done get outta here  why  why because youve lost it thats why  right now she thinks shes won the lottery shes in control  you want her to tell the truth take that away  by killing her thatll work  by giving her someone to answer to someone to be afraid of  she has to believe id be willing to put my revenge over finding this bomb   and youre telling me youre not  george it had to look like that  look at me theres no emotion here  now look at her   what would your next move be  you need to let me go back in there  show her that i have the power to do anything i want to her   if i let you go back in there youve got  all i need is five minutes  just dont let anyone in that room and raise the thermostat ten degrees  are you gonna let me have five minutes  yeah  thank you  in the latest update we have mr president requesting  we need to talk  i told you to leave  well  im not leaving  im your sister  and you can stay angry with me  but we need to figure out what were going to do  do about what  the wedding  we may have to cancel  that would make you

substantial  where is he in visalia now  im not gonna give you his location until we get there  if you could get to him you wouldnt need me my deal would do me no good if im dead  get me visalia  sir

information about the military evacuation  from someone inside the defence department  who  a highlevel staffer hes in the loop he owed me a favour  but theres something more important  he also told me that there are members of your own administration allying against you  they want control of your presidency  thats why i came here today  who sherry  people who disagree with your policies who want
