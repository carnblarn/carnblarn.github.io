cordilla virus its a type iii pneumonic virus remember i raised the possibility a strain could be out there  yeah  it is someone just dropped off a dead body infected with the virus these guys are serious they blew up the door to get our attention this is a message that somebodys got the virus and theyre willing to release it yeah exactly do we need to issue a quarantine advisory no once the host is dead its not contagious call the other county facilities see if there are any more cases  what about the id on the john doe  send everything over well work it up  its on its way  all right thanks sunny what is it initiate a level one setting protocol  and i dont think you have what it takes to keep your mouth shut  what do you mean salazar could have killed shaye any time over the last

refreshing a drive whats going on with salazar were you there when it happened yeah yeah it was pretty crazy hows my dad taking it  hes ok  good i was thinking about talking to him today uhhuh  today might not be the best day  chase no day is a good day we said that we would tell him if we were still together after two months its almost three why dont we just tell him and get it over with all right but ill do it ok  are you sure  yes im sure  really  really you cant put the drives there what i need you to do is look under  f6 right  yeah ok thanks we received results of more tests the news isnt good this is a weaponized strain it has been engineered to kill more rapidly how rapidly its a bit of a guess but based on the autopsy if infection starts at t equals zero hours theres a noncontagious latency period of 14 hours after 14 it presents after 20 the host is incapacitated by 24 the host is dead what are the epidemiological consequences if the virus initiates at a single location there will be a couple hundred cases by the end of day one by the end of day two it could be in the thousands but from there its easier to talk about in percentage of population by the end of the first week nine per cent of los angeles county will be infected nine per cent thats over a million people and those people will die within 24 hours of infection so tell me if someone were gonna try to release this virus into the general population how would they do it thats the milliondollar question it could come from anywhere we dont know who has it we dont know where they plan to release it we dont even know what form its in kyle what ma  tim wants you to know hes at the pool  thanks ma can you take me to the doctor later on this afternoon  whats dad doing  on a job interview fingers crossed fingers crossed can aunt norma take you why whats so important that you cant take me i mean its just i got a bunch of stuff to do today ma im sorry  fine ill call norma  thanks love you ma mr president the country was in shock after the attempt on your life but its prayers were answered when you survived that said many americans have expressed concern that you are not fully recovered and are not strong enough to serve for four more years how would you respond to those who make such claims i wake up every morning at 5am i spend the first hour in the weight room while im exercising im prepping for my meetings  and then i put in a 16hour day  hold on could we pause the video please get ready to play it back sorry chuck hold on dont dignify that question with a defensive response i didnt realize that stating the facts was being defensive they bring up the assassination attempt fine you remind them it was your administration that arrested the man behind the attempt on your life and exposed his organization and put his toptier people away all this while you were in this socalled weakened state keeler would be lucky to have a fraction of your energy thats what you tell em mr

concerns its not just a random occurrence  meaning what  ctu is looking to the possibility that this could be a criminal action criminal action based on this one death i dont know the details but it has to do with the circumstances under which the body was found  keep your eye on this one  ok chuck can we go down to question seven about homeland security  chloe  yes  where are the transcripts of salazar  i sent them to your system in your directory dammit i wanted it stored with the rest of the files from salazar ok ill do it chloe if you cant get things right the first time i can get someone

population as your experts will tell you you will not have time to stop its spread details of how ramn is to be delivered will follow  thats it  do we know where the call originated it came out of a scrambled satellite signal were trying to narrow it down you know salazar better than anybody else here who are we dealing with his brother hector was next in command he went underground when ramn was taken into custody look i know that the salazars own multiple properties in south america and mexico registered under dummy corporations unfortunately the mexican government is saying they cant locate them were gonna have to throw out a pretty large net to trace the origin of that call  well work on it  how are we doing with the id on the body  michelles running the dna  what about prints and dental  no teeth no fingertips  we need this id its the only hook weve got what about questioning salazar complete waste of time this is a man without vulnerability he doesnt respond to interrogation or care about a living soul including his children tony weve a match on john doe  show us what you got  the dead body is a david goss hes a street dealer in east la also an informant he flipped sides so many times dea stopped working with him  last known address  were working on it we need to know who infected goss work up a list of people involved in his life this week  well pull together everything we can  work it from the other side too go through salazars network find the supplier who sold to goss good work chase come with me lets see if anythings come in on hector entonces asegrate
