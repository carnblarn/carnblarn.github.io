go live with a story today  just what is it you think is going on  i think the alert condition has been elevated and you dont want us to know that sir  you think  do you want me to tell you my sources you know i cant do that  youre barking up the wrong tree ron  i dont recall the last time a journalist got a private interview with the president  on a few minutes notice  so my 22 years in the business tells me im barking up the right tree  i tell you what ron  theres gonna be a briefing tomorrow if you want a 30minute jump i can arrange it  why are you horsetrading with me  because if you go live with a story about unsubstantiated threats  you will cause mass hysteria   that could be worse than the threat itself  so there is a threat  ron we get them every day  so you want me to sit on this  even though its my professional right to take what ive got on the air  ron you know me  ive been more forthcoming with the press and public than any politician you know  so when i ask you for a favour i do it in the spirit of whats best for the american people   let me think about it  fair enough   thank you mr president  thank you ron   armus  yes sir   i think were gonna have to deal with this  yes sir  mr wieland im richard armus im with the presidents secret service blue unit  theres something the president wants you to see before you go   it wont take more than a few minutes  let go
