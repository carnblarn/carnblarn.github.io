well get through it  door opens  would you give your mother and me a few minutes  lm sorry  l uh  didnt mean to interrupt your celebration  you couldve joined it  well lm not in the mood to celebrate the end of your campaign david   you just gave your concession speech  that remains to be seen  do you really think people want a president  who acts like some guest on a bad afternoon talk show confessing his sins publicly  lts always possible that they want someone honest   mike seems to think l still have a shot  lts his job to tell you what you wanna hear  mine is to tell you the truth  youre not qualified to tell me the truth  lt took 13 minutes for you to tear apart everything that it took us 25 years to build  why dont you just let me mourn that loss ok  fair enough  l only hope your conscience comforts you when you finally realise this is all over  you mean the campaign or us   confirm alpha one  this is alpha one   bauers gone below  positive it was bauer  yes   whats he doing here  he wasnt invited thats for sure  alarm  door opens   my name is jack bauer and l work for c  ctu  l know who you are l checked you out my name is desalvo dod  whatever this place is its obvious that no ones supposed to know its here  well you seem to have found it ok  this is a prison facility  classthree detention centre so what the hell are you doin here  at 8am this morning there was an assassination attempt on senator palmer  lm the lead investigator l was following a thread the thread led me here  l need more than that  the people that want palmer dead bribed someone from the power company  to shut down the electricity to the grid youre hooked into  they were ordered to do this at 720  somethings gonna happen here then isnt it  mr desalvo you better listen to me  the people that are behind this assassination attempt are exmilitary serbs  they work for the drazen family theyve killed a lot of people today  and theyll kill a lot more unless we do something so sir l will ask one more time  what is happening here at 720   a prisoner is being delivered by chopper  who  his identitys classified even from me they move him every few weeks  what do these drazens want with him anyway  lts hard to tell unless l know who the prisoner is  they might wanna kill him they might wanna set him free  either way you got about five minutes youd better call for backup   backup cant get here in five minutes  call anyway  lf lm wrong youve gone through a little trouble lll take the heat  lf lm right youve potentially saved every life in this building  please  dials phone  yeah have wykoff call me asap  thank you whats your personnel here  three guards plus a maintenance man two technicians   are they weaponstrained  no the civilians have never fired a weapon  the drazens dont know that lssue them full service gear have them stand by   to do what exactly  to make this place look more secure  at least until backup arrives  lts almost time three minutes   you still havent heard from your brother  no  he didnt verify meeting the man from the power company  lf there was a problem he wouldve called  you seem anxious harris l thought professionals didnt get anxious  professionals get very anxious when a plan goes off the tracks   theres nothing wrong  then whats bauer doing here  just get your men ready lts time  hey come here   no like this  desalvo all right lets get moving  keep your stock in tight keep your weapon down youre gonna be all right   any word on the backup  theyre lookin into it  weapon   we good  yes sir   lets go  all right  helicopter approaches  put your men in front of the lights so they can be seen  form a line right in front of the lights  look like youre ready for somethin   you said thered be a warden and three guards l count eight including bauer   theyre expecting us andre  doesnt matter  the powers going down in 25 seconds the sudden darkness will disorient them   what if there is no darkness  there will be  go go go go go  eight more seconds  five four  three two one   the perimeter lights are still on  dammit   all right were still going  no security is twice what we anticipated  the lights are on well be cut to pieces   get ready to move  we have to stand down   my money my decision  my crew theyll obey my orders   all right  plans have changed stand down   sit down  my father is jack bauer  sit  hes the director of the los angeles bureau of ctu   counter terrorist unit have you heard of it  l cant say that l have  do you want the number  look what l want is information on frank allard  and his plans to buy and distribute  l dont know him l met him for the first time a couple of hours ago  do you know that someone tried to kill david palmer this morning   yeah  arent you curious how l know about it  l dont know maybe because its been on the news the last 12 hours  l didnt realise l was kidnapped by the same people who were tryin to kill senator palmer  l know this sounds crazy but they kidnapped my mother  and tried to get my father to help them but he rescued us  then he dropped you off at frankies so you could earn spending money dealing drugs  no no they brought us to a safe house but it was attacked  and l think they captured my mother again  ok you know she told me you had an active imagination she wasnt kidding   who  your friend the one we picked you up with   melanie  mmhm  no no shes not my friend she thinks lm after her boyfriend  you cant believe anything she says about me  lm gonna stick you back in the holding cell maybe itll convince you not to screw around  call this number tell them that l am jack bauers daughter and that lm here  ask them if they think lm screwing around  come on  wait just because they havent attacked yet doesnt mean theyre not going to  maybe maybe this is a crock and theres nobody there  drazens crew is out there they didnt get the power to shut down  theyre working on their contingency plan trust me l know these people   theres not much else l can do  there is let me talk to that prisoner  no access is something l cant give my orders are explicit l cant even speak to him  everything happening here is connected to the assassination attempt on senator palmer  lf you do not let me interrogate that prisoner youre putting the senators life in danger  listen bauer you are welcome to go over my head if you want but l cant help you  now l gotta process this guy   wait you said you work for the dod right  and  can l borrow your phone  l wanna clear every interview nicole gives  yes personally whenever possible l wanna be there  let me know  palmer so is it as bad as sherry said it would be  predicted a sharp drop in senator palmers numbers its not turning out that way  lnstant polls indicate that the senators base of support is holding steady in most areas  and in some cases its actually increasing  when asked if his disclosures made them more likely to vote for him in the election  less likely or made no difference at all  while only 18 per cent said less likely  phone rings  looks like you were right david  seemed to indicate that voters approved of senator palmers honesty  before a national television audience a little more than a halfhour ago  senator lts a jack bauer  he says its urgent  thank you jack its me did you get anything from alexis drazen  no hes coming out of surgery now but l did follow up a lead we got from his hotel   lm gonna need your help  go on  lm at a classthree detention facility lts a prison that doesnt exist   and neither does its new prisoner  whos the prisoner  thats where l need your help this is run by the department of defense   you want me to pull some strings  l need access to the prisoner  the facilitys located in saugus at the address you gave me  the wardens name is desalvo hes a reasonable guy but his hands are tied   lll do what l can  thank you sir  come on you son of a bitch turn around  voices   that prisoners identity is classified  l need to know who that prisoner is  no  thats impossible  you recognise him   thats victor drazen  who is he  the man l killed two years ago  all right listen bauer youre asking me to risk my job maybe go to jail  l need some quid pro quo whats your connection to this guy  what lm about to tell you is secured information  two years ago a congressional subcommittee  decided victor drazen was the key threat to the peace in bosnia  so they authorised a mission to take him out l led that mission  when we got there things went wrong  today l found out that drazens wife and daughter were killed in the attack  l thought wed killed drazen but apparently l was wrong  so now his sons wanna break him out  and they wanna exact a revenge on me  his people kidnapped my wife and daughter we got them back theyre safe for now  but if drazen escapes l lose any leverage lve got of keeping his people from my family   lll make another call  we dont have time for calls  we need to take this prisoner and move him ourselves now  l said lll make a call   we still need to cut the power  but your brother hasnt contacted us yet  he would have called by now  if he were alive  we should assume alexis is dead there may be another way though  the substation for this sectors a halfmile from here  a few ounces of c5 should be sufficient  to save time well go in through the front  the idea is not to attract attention  the idea is to get my father out of prison  this is the best chance well ever have   these dont match  uhhuh  hold on wheres jack l thought he was with you   he opted to stay in the field literally  ln saugus   yeah the address from the drazen file  why didnt he come back with you  l dont know hes a stubborn guy he insisted on staying  meanwhile alexis drazen came to at the hospital so l headed there to interrogate him  l cut off his morphine supply so he should be pretty chatty in about an hour  you didnt tell jack about his family did you what are you doing george  what are you doing the last time l checked it wasnt in my job description  to have to explain myself to my subordinates  now unless theyve called off the hit on palmers life  you should be working on securing his agenda for the rest of the day  looks like hes going to be our next president  tv senator palmer has carried new york and with polls closing shortly in california  it now appears that senator palmer will maintain his lead  hey everyones outside celebrating the latest poll  come on out sweetheart  what is it david  whats wrong now  before when you said it was over  and l asked you what you meant the campaign or me  what l said came out of wanting to protect my family wanting to protect you  you cant hold that against me  sherry  youre an amazing woman  smart determined sure of yourself  you always know what you want  but you dont want me not really  l dont think youve wanted me for a very long time   thats nonsense  ls it  maybe if everything with nicole and keith never happened but it did happen  and you kept the truth from me for all these years  l dont think you couldve done that without pulling away  and now  now l cant help thinking that l dont trust you any more  and if l cant trust you  how could l love you  well david  you may not love me but you will never leave me  you take all the time you need to get yourself together  and then you come out and you greet all the people  who have given up every day and every night of their lives  for the last year to put us in office   us  yes  thats right us  because come january david  when youre being sworn in  make no mistake about it  this woman here will be standing right next to you  male guard open up two  catcalling  female guard move away from the door now  male guard ok martinez settle down over there  one thing l dont get  if drazen was the target then whats he doin here  someone thought he was better alive than dead  by someone you mean one of our people  hes probably been feeding them intelligence  then why put you through the charade of tryin to kill him  because they wanted the rest of the world to think he was dead  my mission was set up to fail from the start l lost every man l went in there with  phone rings  desalvo  yeah hes right here   l understand  we got permission to move drazen  no that request is still working its way up but dod says you can interrogate him   good  bauer  five minutes  fine  my name is jack bauer  youll have to pardon my surprise  l saw you die  l watched you enter a building  nobody couldve survived that explosion  our intelligence told us the building was empty when you entered  your fight is with me  not my wife not my daughter but with me  please leave my family alone  mr drazen you have already lost your wife and your daughter  you dont need to lose your sons too  my sons are soldiers  then they will die for nothing  we know about the rescue plan lt was scheduled for 720  we stopped it weve called in for backup lf they try again sir they will die  then you have nothing to worry about   call it off victor  how can l  the same way youve been communicating with them this entire time  call it off or your sons will die  buzzer  door opens  all right  well move him  ls there another way out of here thats not on the schematic a fire or flood egress   yes  good   lll get my men ready  have them armed like we did before  get up  get up  were evacuating the prisoner have all personnel convene in quarter c  yes sir  stop  applause   desalvo move out  jack lets go  get against the wall   the powers down in the west quadrant  man copy that  they are here
