ok  ok  lm here at ctu ifyou need me  l know  ok bye  pierce folks l know youre all busy so lll be as brief as l can be   good youre just in time  palmer whats going on  bauer sent over photos of the people targeting you  the threat against senator palmer remains a high probability  but we have gotten a significant piece of headsup intelligence  these three men  are the suspected shooters  now since youre all on the front line of this campaign  were hoping you can expand our surveillance reach  we can always use more eyes and ears in the field  lf you see anyone who you suspect as being one of these people  let an agent know immediately   pierce everybody clear on that  elizabeth whats wrong   nina ok but the fact is rick ran away  he was scared  nina apparently  any explanation he has doesnt change the fact hes a fugitive  lf you know where he is and arent telling us that constitutes   l dont know where he is  are you sure  what l am sure of is that he helped us escape  and if it wasnt for him we would have never got out of there  kim  when people are taken hostage  its not uncommon for them to feel a certain bond with their kidnappers  rick isnt a kidnapper  and anyway l dont know where he is  oh lm sorry nina l thought you were finished  um whenever youre ready we can pick up where we left off  ok um  why dont you take a break and your mother and l can finish up in here  you ok   sure youre ok to do this  yeah sure are you  yeah  listen nina um  l dont want you to have to tiptoe around me  jack and l were separated when you slept with him  lm not gonna hold that against you ok  ok um  you and kim have both said that rick helped you  but talking to kim l get the sense that shes withholding something  based on what  shes protecting rick she seems to have feelings for him  from what l can tell  well there may have been an attraction when she met him last night  but if kimberly knew anything lm sure shed tell you  are you sure about that  shes my daughter l think l know her better than you  phone rings   bauer  lts david palmer   sir is everything all right  lm not sure  whats going on  a member of my advance team elizabeth nash  she recognised one of the assassins in the photos you sent secret service  lts victor drazens son alexis   does she know where he is  theyre in contact  contact what do you mean ln which context  lntimate  senator is this person in a position to endanger your security  lm afraid so look shes pretty shaken up but she wants to help  good we have to bring her in to ctu and question her  well get a helicopter over to you  lll have her ready oh what about ellis did he retrieve the file on operation nightfall   l lost contact with ellis  lost contact what do you mean  we got interrupted in the middle of our phone call sir lve got a very bad feeling about this   so what are you telling me  for now we have to assume ellis is dead   keep me posted  yes sir  milo get me chopper command  phone ringing   whos that kat by the salads   hello  rick its kim   hey  this woman here shes really pushing me   whatd you tell her  the truth that you helped us escape  well thats really gonna save my ass  lm sorry lm a little edgy right now  l just think if you tell her what happened itll work out  she wont believe me  l dont know how much longer l can cover for you  ok ok can she prove anything  l dont think so  well thats all that matters  listen l appreciate what youre doing and all but you probably shouldnt call here   at least not for a while  how long  l dunno l gotta   whos that  l dont know just a wrong number  lm worked lm gonna crash for a while ok  so is there anything else you can tell me about gaines  maybe a conversation you overheard   whos gaines  lra gaines the leader of the group  right   teri  nina lm fine  maybe we should take a break  maybe you should do your job nina dont you have a job to do  l wish it were that simple  things tend to get complicated when you screw your boss  look this obviously isnt working  no its not  lm sorry l thought l could stay calm and rational about this but l cant do it lm sorry  theres no apology needed but l think paulson should finish up here  george what are you doing here   lm the new quarterback  since when   since right now  what about alberta green  back at district  so chapelle thought youd do a better job keeping an eye on me than she would  l dunno jack something like that l guess  so its really drazens boys that are after palmer huh  this whole thing is a revenge play for killing their father  l know why theyre gunning for you but why are they after palmer  senator palmer was head of the subcommittee that authorised the mission   you got ellis tracking down the file on that  l had ellis  l lost contact with him 20 minutes ago  you think they took him out  yes l do we got a break on another front though  a ms elizabeth nash part of the senators advance team  identified one of the shooters from photos l sent over shed been dating him  she had no idea who he was shes shaken up but shes on her way here for a debriefing  which one of em was she seeing  alexis drazen shes supposed to meet him in his hotel room in an hour  good thatll give us time to stage an arrest  think about this what if she keeps her date wed have the upper hand for the first time   see what we could learn  lts risky  ld have a squad across the hall ready to go into that room before anything could happen  george l think this is too big an opportunity just to pass up   what time is she getting here  ten minutes   well talk to her then make up our minds  absolutely   shes going to the ctu office  man why are they taking her there  they wanna find out all they can about this alexis drazen   ls that the brother  no its his son   hey let me call you back  all right lll wait foryour call  keith come in  whats up  we havent had much chance to talk since last night and it seems like every time we do  were at each others throats  everythings ok between you and me  l guess youve noticed that we havent been quite on the same page today  lt has been kinda hard to miss  the pressures on lts testing all of us  for sure  thats what l wanted to talk about  lt stayed in my head what you said a couple of hours ago  about how dr ferragamo was always there when you needed someone and l wasnt  lm sorry but thats just how it was then  thats all gonna change  starting now  l know l cant earn your trust overnight  but if you just come to me when you need to talk l promise you son  lll always be there  thanks dad  so what about dr ferragamo did the police say anything  we havent called yet   what are we waiting for  were not putting anything off keith  lts just something else has come up listen to me we have a security breach on our staff  we have to deal with that first  what kind of security breach   l cant tell you  you cant tell me anything  look keith l have to be able to make decisions without you challenging me  look everything youre feeling nows the time l need you dad  not just to talk to me but to do the right thing  keith keith  l will do the right thing at the right time  yeah lm sure you will  lve found bauers wife and daughter they were moved to a safe house   where are you  lm almost in  how many men are guarding them  lm handling the situation andre rest assured the women will be dead soon  call me the minute its done   milo can you help me out with something  yeah  whats wrong with the system my terminals locked l just downloaded all my files to here  dammit

look here this should get you into anything you need  thanks  jack dont worry youll be back in your office by tomorrow   by tomorrow lll be in federal custody  but why  lm only on provisional status for the day when palmer leaves the state l face charges  yeah  lm sorry look youre all set here just  thanks   milo  yeah  have you noticed anyone accessing anything unusual on the servers  what do you mean  l dont know anything received or relating to sensitive intel  no but l havent been looking for it  start looking  wait you think theres another mole inside ctu  l dont know just let me know if you find anything ok  ok   all lm saying is dont test me  carl lm not   l will do what l said  sighs keith  lm serious l have nothing left to lose not any more   youre upset  thats right   ok we should talk  lm glad you understand   you know the griffith park observatory  yeah  can you meet me there now  yeah l can be there 15 minutes   be where  nowhere   keith  lm trying to protect you  the last time you tried to protect me someone died  nicole please  lm sorry that was a terrible thing to say   the less you know  who were you talking to on the phone   you trust me dont you  trust goes both ways keith  carl  why  l dont wanna spend my life with the same regret lve had for the past seven years   you didnt kill gibson intentionally  but l kept the truth from coming out  and now with dr ferragamo dead  look l cant do that again nicole l wont and l need your help  for what  listen this secret service guys been dogging me all day   help me get past him  hes here to protect us  everything thats been happening today everything thats still happening  lts not too late to change the way this all plays out  now do you trust me or not  ok good ok  all right  excuse me l was on the phone and l heard a clicking sound  and lm wondering if thats my dad being bugged or if lm just being paranoid  agent well why dont we just go check it out  tv noise  victor drazen had two sons  we know alexis drazen is here l think we should assume andre drazen is here as well   with at least two other shooters right  potentially a third assuming ellis is dead  here she comes  miss nash george mason district director this is agent jack bauer  mr bauer senator palmer told me about you  he said l should do whatever you tell me and l could be sure ld be in good hands  l appreciate that l have to tell you if you wish a lawyer present youre entitled to that  but we in no way consider you a suspect we just wanna ask you a few questions  l dont need a lawyer lll cooperate in any way l can  come on in   can l have something to drink  lll get you a glass of water  so  how did alexis drazen represent himself to you  he told me he ran an importing company out of berlin  he seemed successful he gave me this on our third date  lt must have cost him 10000 lts real which is more than l can say for him   when did you meet him  about a month ago in dc  lm with the senators advance team  we had some downtime and a few of us went out for drinks  so you met him in a bar  when youre working on a campaign you basically put your life on hold for a year  theres always people around but its lonely  youre supposed to meet mr drazen in his hotel room in about an hour  thats right  miss nash  would you be willing to keep your appointment with alexis   you want me to spy on him  well only if you feel comfortable   lf you have any doubts at all  wed keep it simple  we want you to plant a tracking device on him so we can trace his locations  lts just the thought of seeing him again  we would make it so that we could hear and see everything that took place in that room  you would be safe  lts ok we understand jack you head over to the hotel lll finish debriefing miss nash  yeah  mr bauer you say that this might help protect the senator  yes l think it would  the senator is safe hes got secret service men with him around the clock  that didnt stop alexis from getting to me did it and if they got to me  they might have got to somebody else  lll do it lf something happened to senator palmer that l might have prevented  l could never forgive myself please  l have to do this  he looks familiar too l think l heard them call him jenson  paulson recognise him  how about him  you know this one  kim yeah  he was one of the guards l think they called him eli   can you tell me anything about him  no  daniels this is breeher  daniels this is breeher  paulson these rooms with monitors  they had your father under surveillance   from what l saw  even at ctu   l dont know  what about you mrs bauer  mrs bauer   lts important we get through the questions  agent paulson l think we need a break   my moms very tired  yeah ok  mom are you ok  mom  ron  ron   come with me go go shh lets go  mom   come on go go  kim come on  ln here  lock the door  clink   come out hands where l can see them  dont shoot lm coming out   now  lm coming out  drop the gun  get down down  teri hurry  kim go go go go go   silenced gunshot  get down  kim look out  honey get down  were ready to go gentlemen  lll fill you in with the rest at the hotel thats where youll meet the team  dont be nervous lll be with you every step of the way  jack l gotta talk to you  secret service will take you to the helicopter lll be there in one second  what  they just found elliss body in a mens room in the french quarter   do we have any leads yet  no not yet  keep me posted  what are you doing here   ld no reason to stay teri and kim are fine  l asked you to stay to make them feel safe  they are safe l settled them in paulsons taking care of them  and the extra security team is in place  hang on kim   you ok honey  yeah  l think we lost em lm just gonna go check l want you to stay right here ok   yeah  stay right here  argh   hes dead isnt he ferragamos dead  l have no idea   dont try to blow me off carl  the authorities are looking into it   they wont find anything  lve gone through this with your father  my father is his own man and so am l so you can go through it with me  lets just go what do you need tell me what you need  ferragamo was there for me when nobody else was l might not be alive if not for him  he also betrayed your confidence keith hes the one who went to maureen kingsley   that doesnt justify murder  what exactly are you hoping to do   bring him back to life  l want justice  justice well justice is a tricky thing keith  take lyle gibson for example you want justice for that   gibsons death was an accident  maybe so but lets be objective  he rapes your sister you pay him a visit he ends up dead accident could be a tough sell  lf l go public with the truth about ferragamo youll go public with a lie about gibson  ls that what youre saying   oh brother  theres one catch here carl  there are two coverups and youre involved in both however it plays out its bad for you   l can take care of myself  no  the moneymen behind my fathers campaign take care of you  but if things get ugly theyll make sure youre the one who takes the fall wont they carl  or maybe theyll do to you what you did to dr ferragamo  you are in way over your head  and youre getting nervous l can smell it  ok you listen to me whatever you think you can do to me or anyone else  itll be a hundred times worse for you   lm not so sure  well l am  because if you push things too far they will do whatever they have to do  killing david palmers son might get messy  oh l think theyd be a little more subtle than that  lm not following you  there is some physical evidence in george ferragamos office  that leads directly to you  subtle enough so the fire marshals didnt find it the first time  but with a little help theyll find it   so lll be framed for ferragamos murder  like l said whatever it takes  thats why your father backed off and thats why youll back off  tape rewinds  keith lll be framed for ferragamos murder  carl like l said whatever it takes  thats whyyour father backed off and thats whyyoull back off  click  hey  are you ok  what happened  whats your name  l dont remember  you dont even know your name  well you cant stand in the middle of the road  come on get in lll give you a ride  thank you  lm sorry thank you  mom  mom
