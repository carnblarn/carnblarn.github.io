                 tony got a second  what is it  i think its time i stepped down here you go  whats this  access codes to ctu and division youre the new ctu director tony  let me out of here right now i know the bomb didnt go off   i just wanted some company  then what are you doing out here   this is where i belong  i dont  here take it theres cougars out there  if you see one fire a shot in the air and itll take off  roger stanton confesses that hes known about the bomb for weeks  you have to trust me david your presidency is in jeopardy let me help you  no youll leave now  if you resist in any way ill have no choice but to place you under arrest   you gotta give me your badge kate  no i dont believe youd shoot me  wheres the bomb marie the real bomb  you can go to hell you bastard im not telling you anything  why do you want me and my team to leave here so fast the bombs still here isnt it  initiate a grid search on every outbuilding at the airport  starting at the north end headed south  the bomb is on site i repeat the bomb is on site   its armed  how much time have we got  i cant tell it could be any second  let everyone know well be working in hangar 12  were on standby here anything you need agent bauer  copy that  right here should be fine  i need a relay here  let me get a look at the circuit panel  they redirected the circuit bypass ready   easy easy  i got it i got it go ahead  lets check out that timer switch  hang on adjust the flash cap  its a little tight almost there   got it hows that  wait  cap it off  i need the bypass   it worked were in good shape  good  george what are you doing here  this is what killed me id like to be here when they lay it to rest  got it diffused yet   not yet theyre looking at ten minutes  is there a timer   they havent been able to read it  it could detonate any minute  george theyve got it under control  theres gotta be somewhere else youd rather be  i promised myself i would see this through to the end thats what im gonna do   you all right  yeah ill just take something  damn it  just give me a minute ok   is there a problem  the triggers tamperproofed  i shouldve seen it but it was disguised  if its dismantled or disconnected from the main casing itll detonate  are you telling me that there is no way to disarm this bomb  thats what im telling you  goodrich  they cant diffuse it well have to fly it out  this airport doesnt accommodate jets so find me the fastest reliable plane you can  theres a cessna caravan in front of hangar three  shes rock solid cruises at 210  get it  northwest regional  this is jack bauer i need to speak with the president its urgent thank you   did you get a look at the timer  yeah   how much time have we got  55 minutes  need a ride   where are you going  where are you trying to get to   san jose  no kidding thats right where im headed  santa clara actually its just a few minutes past san jose   know what thats ok im fine thanks  dont be scared   im not  then get in   no point wandering around in the night  ill be fine  one second you need a ride next you dont  im sorry its nice that you pulled over its just that  get back in the car now  you dont know how to use that thing  get back in the car and keep driving  bitch   sir when will you have a decision  when will the plane be ready   ten minutes  ill get back to you before then  in the meantime prepare for the two possibilities we discussed   and coordinate with the faa  yes sir  i want maps and charts for both scenarios pacific ocean here desert here  were ready to assemble ill get back to you when we have a final decision  yes sir  i wish i had more faith in the reliability   best you can mike  yes sir  ill discuss consequences of detonation in the pacific ocean  lynne will do the same for the mojave desert  in the time available the plane can get roughly 80 miles offshore  if it splashes down just before detonation the bomb will go off underwater  the ocean will absorb a large portion of the radiation  however prevailing winds would blow a moderate level of fallout  back over the city of los angeles  over time there would be a high incidence of cancer and other radiationrelated diseases   but therell be no immediate casualty  we cant be certain  the shipping lanes into the port of los angeles are extremely busy  in the 80 square miles off the coast of la  the coast guard counts two dozen freighters flying flags from around the world  plus an unknown number of unregistered fishing or pleasure vessels  its likely that one or more of them would be sunk or capsized by the blast  whats the impact on the environment  the blast will wipe out a substantial pocket of biodiversity  keystone species would be exterminated the food chain would be contaminated  and the regional ecological infrastructure would collapse  marine resources such as offshore drilling commercial fishing  even recreational beach usage would become hazardous or impossible for many years  the ecological and economic effects mr president would be devastating   what about the desert  we can designate a ground zero  its isolated so inhabited areas wont be immediately affected  towns could be evacuated within hours without any serious longterm effects  we cant rule out the possibility of isolated campers and hikers  who would be killed or contaminated by the blast  if the wind shifts substantially during the next few hours  it could blow fallout over las vegas  the best meteorological projections indicate that that is a very very slight possibility  longterm effects  an area of a few square miles around ground zero would be highly radioactive for decades  but the truth is we dont get food or any significant resources from the desert anyway  so the overall health risk is relatively small  sounds like the deserts our best option  yes sir we do agree with that but there is one more thing  in the desert ground zero has to be a precise location  a depression below sea level and surrounded by mountains  so it could hopefully contain the fallout  potential target sites are being researched as we speak   all right  point is the airplane isnt a military craft  it doesnt have any of the equipment needed to deliver a payload accurately  to ensure the necessary level of precision a pilot will have to go down with the plane   its a suicide mission  why cant we push it out the side door  its too imprecise sir  if the pilot is flying low enough to ensure accuracy he would be killed by the blast  one man dies mr president to ensure the safety of millions   jack  mr president   the desert  yes sir  jack my people tell me that the pilot has to die  ctu came to the same conclusion the bomb has to be put down on specific coordinates  im sorry but there isnt another way  do we know who the pilot will be  we have a few volunteers sir all of them good men  whoever it is tell him he has the undying gratitude of every citizen of this country  and tell him we will take care of whatever family he leaves behind   yes sir i will  ill be standing by jack   call me back when the planes in the air  yes mr president  funny i dont see any volunteers when was the last time you flew a plane  i can get it in the air and put it down george  so can i im current im instrumentrated and im gonna be dead by the end of the day   problem is you could be dead any minute  i can hang on for another halfhour  if you blacked out and it went down before it got to the desert a lot of people will die   come on jack  i know what youre trying to do  but i gotta say no agent goodrich this is bauer they chose the desert  i want you to clear air space and start immediate evacuation now  gentlemen load this bomb we are a go   its not rated as a priority  i dont care just do it all right   yes sir  thank you  all right mr auda wait here a second well be right with you   agent graves  tony almeida weve been expecting you   they told you whats in the case  personal effects from alis safe house  whos he  his name is yusuf auda his government assigned him as a liaison  they gave us information that got us in the safe house we couldnt refuse to bring him   do you trust him  right now i dont trust anyone  yeah take the case and bring it into that conference room around the corner   ok  thank you   tony almeida director of ctu welcome  thank you  must have had some trip you were 10000 miles away this morning  im ready to get back to work  i understand analysis needs to be done on things seized from syed alis apartment  yeah our lab needs to do some preliminary work first  ill have somebody get you coffee ill be with you in a moment ok thank you  the lab is ready for decryption  good look i might need somebody to do a little handholding here  that mans name over there is yusuf auda  officially hes a visiting intelligence agent entitled to full cooperation  unofficially i dont want him to see anything he doesnt need to see  make sure anybody you assign understands   sure  ok  im gonna deal with this mr auda myself if you need any help call jacobs   tony told you to assign someone to auda  im assigning myself  youre still not comfortable working with me are you  just do your job carrie   so what have we got  most of its innocuous there is one thing  this was wellconcealed obviously it was of great importance to ali  we tried to read it but its encrypted we dont have that technology in the field  ok ill get our people on it right away see what they can find   ok  thanks  sure   almeida  tony have you found kim yet   no were still working on it  im running out of time  i understand but we got our hands full if you could wait until the plane takes off   tony im flying it  what  id like to speak with my daughter while i still got time  theres gotta be somebody else to fly it  somebody that doesnt have a family or at least no kids  i didnt have time to take a census i cant order anyone to do this  please tony youve gotta find her   ill find her  tony one other thing  yeah  in my apartment theres a safe  inside is my will and a letter i wrote to kim in case something ever happened to me  ill make sure she gets it jack   thanks  ill get back to you   you all right honey  i could use a lift  what are you doing way out here  i was on a date and we parked he got a little out of hand so i got out  hop in  thank you i really appreciate this  where would you like to go  i have an aunt in san jose  you were on a date it didnt work out so youre going to your aunts in san jose  honey your business is your business but im not an idiot ok  i know its just been crazy and its a long story and im kind of in a little bit of trouble  if you have a cellphone i actually really need to make a call   to whom  my father  we synchronised this with the timer on the bomb  thank you  good luck  so the plane has some automatic pilot thing  actually no itll have to be flown out to a very precise location  so the pilot  oh my god whos it gonna be  jack bauer  jack  im sorry miss warner but youre gonna have to stay here  cessna 47 fox requesting immediate takeoff   47 fox youre clear on runway three  roger that tower thank you  heres your preliminary draft for your statement tomorrow   yes right thank you  hows the plane doing mike   its at 3000 feet and climbing  out of the city yet  its too soon for that but theyll clear the main population centres in ten minutes  this is a good start but i want to go over it again  call davis i want him to get air force one ready as soon as possible  sir   do you mind if i ask where youre going  los angeles  mr president if i may speak frankly im not sure thats a good idea  it may be a little too handson for lack of a better term  the people want to feel that youre managing events not caught up in them  and in any case i doubt if the secret service will even hear of it  secret service works for me i dont work for them  mr president  sir i do agree with mike  once word gets out that this bomb has gone off theres bound to be civil unrest  i dont think you should be associated with that  the whole country will be traumatised by this bomb  especially the people in los angeles  im gonna reassure them that everything is under control understood  yes sir ill call davis immediately  thank you well leave for the airport now  mike who ended up flying the plane did you get a name  yes sir  jack bauer  id have told you sooner but i figured you had enough on your mind already  cessna 47 fox climb to 10000 feet 08niner  roger 08niner 10000 feet  expect final vectors in five minutes  i copy  agent bauer ive got tony almeida im patching him through hold on one second   jack can you hear me  yeah i can hear you  we found kim shes on the other line  thank you tony good work have you told her anything  no i didnt know if youd want me to  ok   put her through will ya  all right   kim  dad finally oh my god are you ok   im ok sweetheart are you all right  yes im fine  thank god youve had a hell of a day havent you   yeah whats that noise where are you  im in a plane  a plane why  theres something ive gotta tell you itll be hard to hear so i need you to stick with me  we found the bomb it was wired in a way that made it impossible to diffuse it  we needed someone to fly it over the desert so when it exploded nobody would get killed  that someone turned out to be me  how are you getting off the plane  im not sweetheart  the bomb has to be dropped in a very specific area there was no other choice  im sorry  but dad   dad no no you cant do this to me  kim   there has to be somebody else  i didnt have any other choice   kim i need you to listen to me  im sorry im so sorry   sweetheart what are you sorry for  oh god everything  ive been so mean and so bad to you  honey anything that ever happened between us it was never your fault  i love you just the way you are i dont ever want you to change you understand that  i love you more than anything in the world  kim can you still hear me  yes  honey i want you to live your life i want you to be happy  thats all ive ever wanted for you  i want you to try and grow up and be the kind of person  that would have made your mom proud ok  oh god  promise me that  i promise  honey ive gotta start focusing on what im doing up here im running out of time  im gonna have to say goodbye  i love you more than anything in the world and i will always be with you ok  remember that  im proud of you and i love you   i love you too sweetheart  no  goodbye  im sorry honey what do you want to do   i gotta get out of here  what do you mean why  i was supposed to get out of la but it doesnt matter any more  no wait a minute this is crazy wait just wait call someone else  i cant im ok i need to be alone  you ok  we found kim   jack get a chance to say goodbye  yeah  so whatd you find  we decrypted alis hard drive  its a recording of conversation that took place four months ago  conversation between who  syed ali and highranking government officials from these three countries  what were saying is that these three countries not only knew about the bomb  but they bought it and supplied it to syed ali   yeah thats what it looks like  how sure are we about this translation  we were rushed it needs to be refined but the substance of it is accurate  well need voice authentication on all four of these men   ive already got people working on it  get division involved as well   northwest regional  tony almeida at ctu  i need to speak to the president about todays terrorist attack  ill transfer you  what is it mr almeida  we have a recording of syed ali collaborating with highranking officials  from three middle eastern countries in preparation for todays attack   when did this come to our attention  just within the last few minutes   who else knows  our division headquarters sir  they have ties to the other agencies which means everybody knows  i tagged it with a sectionfour security sir  but i did think it was important to get going on the authentication process quickly   how long will that be  we should have confirmation in an hour  let me ask you another question mr almeida  why would syed ali record a conversation like this in the first place  half the time these people dont trust each other any more than they trust us  my guess is ali wanted some ammunition to protect himself  in case any of these three countries ever turned against him  all right  thank you mr almeida ill let you get back to work good job  please pass on my appreciation to your staff   thank you mr president  thank you  three governments in the middle east may be behind this bomb  yes sir i gathered that  we could be at war soon mike  and once it begins theres no guarantee itll be limited to these three countries  ive been thinking all day about something lincoln said during the civil war  i dont claim to have controlled events  but confess plainly that events have controlled me  its bad enough that someone tried to smuggle a nuclear weapon in here  worse that they succeeded  but once this bomb actually goes off my options will narrow very very quickly  this is cessna 47 fox i have just crossed over to the low desert  im on final line to target any change in my coordinates   negative theyre confirmed as given  copy that confirming autopilot 08niner   coordinates are now locked  roger over   dont move  hey hey hey  the service is bad enough you dont have to shoot me   what the hell are you doing here  i felt like taking a ride  how the hell did you get on this plane  wasnt that hard to them im still head of ctu  son of a bitch  brought something for ya  its a parachute  i can see what is it george i already told you im taking this plane in  that might have made sense back on the ground  but lets face it jack the hard parts over  you took off cleared the city  whats left but flying straight and level and taking it into a dive  am i right  unless of course maybe you wanna die   what are you talking about  youve had a death wish since teri died  the way things have been going for you the past year  this probably doesnt look like such a bad idea  you get to go out in a blaze of glory one of the greatest heroes of all time  leave your troubles behind  this could be the easy way out huh  you still got a life jack you wanna be a real hero heres what you do  you get back down there and you put the pieces together  find a way to forgive yourself for what happened to your wife  you make things right with your daughter and you go on serving your country  thatd take some real guts  go on jack you got 12 minutes  whats it gonna be you wanna live or not   you really think you can do this  yes  you are absolutely sure you can do this  jack im supposed to do this  you need to maintain this heading and this airspeed  the second the lad reads a minute and a half you initiate a dive at a 30degree angle   wont that get me in early  thats the point  you have to be certain that the bomb is already in the depression before it goes off  i got it  thank you george  thank you  get your chute on and get the hell outta here   im staying with you as long as possible  i got it together im fine  this is not negotiable im bailing out four minutes before impact  that should get me far enough away  this is jack bauer patch me through to ctu   yes sir right away  almeida  tony this is jack i need you to get a helicopter in the air immediately  we got a change of plans here im bailing out george is taking the plane down  whats george doing there  we need authentication from three sources for each voice  division has public speeches from ministers see if you can get his voice on phone taps  michelle  send a chopper to trail jacks plane mason got on board dont ask how  hell take the plane the rest of the way we need that chopper to pick jack up  ill explain later  mr almeida may i know what you found on the hard drive   you dont have security clearance  mr almeida  i and my country have shown good faith in helping you to find syed alis safe house  im asking you to do the same by giving me some idea of whats going on   im sorry but i cant tell you at this time  you americans   we americans what  nothing  come   sir general bowdens here to see you  of course show him in   mr president  general bowden  i understand the bomb is over the mojave it may detonate without causing loss of life   that is our hope  thats wonderful news   congratulations on your achievement  thank you general  perhaps its appropriate to begin discussing the matter of retaliation   go on  yes sir  the joint chiefs have been assuming the bomb was the work of second wave  it appears they had the backing of three governments   thats not definite yet general  no sir i understand that  but for planning purposes we should proceed as if it is  i request authority to activate plans to invade the countries in question  activate there are plans already in existence  we have plans for every conceivable contingency mr president  i see so what exactly do you mean by activate  putting the relevant military units on alert beginning logistical operations  coordinating sources regarding the probable level of resistance  to an invasion by american forces  talk of an invasion is premature  i agree mr president this is in the planning stages only  activate your plan but take no steps to implement without my direct authorisation  of course mr president  lynne  we may be talking about world war iii  ok im set  george is there anything you want me to take care of  oddly enough i think i got everything squared away  i even got to spend a little time with my son  i didnt even know you had one   im glad you got to see him  yeah me too  i dont think he was particularly but  actually i wouldnt mind if you checked in on him  of course i will   its time  yeah  yeah  mr president  at this altitude the explosion should be visible on the eastern horizon  i dont know if you want to take a look  three two
