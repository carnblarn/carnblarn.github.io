broke his parents hearts too  im so sorry marie but i dont know what these government people found  and believe me i wish they hadnt have found anything  but arent you curious why are they asking dad questions now  you started a witchhunt in our family  no marie its because reza is connected to some bad people   maybe even terrorists  youre out of your mind  were not gonna put our heads in the sand marie or this could end up hurting dad  were not gonna let that happen  come with me  what did you tell them what did you accuse my father of  i didnt accuse him of anything its his company

ever gotten from you is suspicion and resentment im sick of it  i didnt connect you to a terrorist  no then who did i dont know any terrorists  all i know is you paid for someone to dig up dirt on me

nice work kate  call me when you get that   ill have it today four oclock too late  no   ill talk to you then  yeah good alrighty byebye  if it isnt the chief of staff himself mike  sherry  you look beautiful as always  what are you doing here did david ask you to come here  no i just showed up on my own  so how have you been   fine mike just fine  yeah  yeah you know its been a challenging year but what is it they say  we learn from our mistakes and grow from our misfortunes  have you told that to david  no  i dont think hes ready to hear that yet not now  but he is waiting for you so why dont you just go on in  ill see you later im sure  here you go sir  dont speculate dont say anything we dont know where he is   that is our position  yes maam   all right good thank you  youre welcome  sir we have to talk about ron wieland  what about him does anybody know we have him sequestered  no but jenny got a call from his production crew they havent seen him in four hours  theyll figure out the last person they saw him with was you  then leak a story  mike good to see you  i got here as soon as i could hi lynne  mike  armus brought me up to speed on the wieland situation  i did some research found out there is precedent for the executive branch  taking action against the press at times of national crisis  so when you say leak a story what kind of a story  make it appear as though wieland went to portland on a personal matter  armus can arrange that its a bandaid but itll get us through the day   talk to armus put it in motion  yes sir   i saw sherry on my way in  oh   should i attach any significance to that  it was her decision to come here  thats what she said but i have to tell you im surprised youre allowing her to stay  for the time being mike just for the time being  lets go to the oc ill bring you up to speed theres a lot to cover   you wanna send that on to division  yes sir   mr mason  yeah   i just got off the phone with ed miller  hows it going between jack and nina  he doesnt know jack drugged him and got on the plane without him  please tell me youre kidding  sloanes bringing ed back now what should i do  theyre on a plane theres nothing anybody can do  except hope that his impulse for revenge doesnt cloud his judgement   you mean like drugging one of our agents  what can i say the guys a little crazy  thats why i didnt want him here in the first place but he gets results  and we need some pretty big results here so  just because sherry tells you that theres a conspiracy against you  that doesnt make it true  but if it is true it will affect every aspect of our response to this bomb  sherry was right about the military evacuation of la  thats specific information  she still has wellrouted sources but a conspiracy  dont forget where shes coming from she may have her own agenda  im well aware of that mike shes on a tight leash i wanna find her source  let me look into this socalled cabal against you  if theres any substance to it ill uncover it  right now the country needs your attention on the situation in la  start with stanton  stanton  the head of nsa conspiring against the president of the united states  aside from the implications if that were true hasnt he always been an ally to you  yes but hes also eric rayburns boss  its not inconceivable rayburn could be doing stantons bidding   they have always been on the same page  thats not enough to indict roger  i know thats why i want you to check him out im hoping you can prove me wrong  ill talk to roger as soon as i settle in see if i can get a read on him

weddings been postponed  i want you to call larry tell him where i am   dad larrys a tax attorney  it doesnt matter  it doesnt matter hell know what do   ok  all right  good afternoon  you two havent been formally introduced lynne kresge sherry palmer  lynne its lovely to meet you  mrs palmer mr president there were a few guidelines from director stanton  that i wanted to go over with you in this meeting  ok let me just break the ice here lynne i have invoked executive privilege  and have granted sherry a provisional security clearance   i see  this meeting is about the possibility  of people inside this administration who may be organising against me   against you  david  maybe you should bring lynne up to speed on where we are with roger stanton   mr president  things have been happening too fast today  our problems are compounded by the possibility of a dissenting faction   you think roger might be a part of that  its possible  if you dont mind my asking sir what led you to this hypothesis  it troubles me to articulate this lynne  but the ambassadors helicopter accident solved a lot of roger stantons issues   those issues were shared by many  im so sorry to interrupt david  but theres something else that you probably dont know lynne  and that is that roger stanton  has been having secret meetings with the minority leader in the senate  and eric rayburn has been in attendance  actually sherry i am aware of those meetings  they were trying to forge a bipartisan base  in order to stop questionable allocations made by the armed services committee  and sir the only reason i did not brief you on this earlier  is because the vote is not for another two months  but i have very detailed records if you would like to take a look at them  this doesnt solve our problems today  weve got to avert a disaster and we cant do that if our own people are working against us  now i need to know that roger stanton is supporting this administration  im already working alongside roger  lynne id like you to keep track of your conversations with him as well  now ive put together a list of people on the hill who might be able to help in this matter  thank you mike  la investigations paul koplin speaking  hi this is kate warner is ralph burton there  no im sorry kate ralphs not here can i help you with something   i need to talk to ralph  he left for the day  he works for me im familiar with the case is there something i can do for you  i need some help  i have to get into my fathers private records  lynne lynne   yes  can i have a sec  sure  i know that youre uncomfortable with me taking some of these tasks from you  after all im not officially on davids staff  mrs palmer my discomfort has nothing to do with you being on his staff  my only concern is to serve the president  i need to know the people around him are competent i dont know you  you seem like a pretty smart woman so let me explain something to you clearly  mm  david did not get here by himself  hes had competent people around him his entire life  obviously youre one of them not necessarily the best just the most recent  so have some respect for those of us who put him into office  we just might be able to help you  fair enough  be careful sherry  i need lynne dont turn this into a competition  i understand  i just need her to know that im not just around here as windowdressing   im sure she got the message  ill behave promise  sherry you dont have a lot of friends here today  in fact it seems like every time i turn around somebodys advising me to send you away  then why dont you  because you may be able to get information that nobody else can  ok slow down  as soon as we get a positive id well be in within 30 seconds   this is it  get out  get out  all teams on alert nina is in play nina is in play  this is team two weve got her  roger that team two  stay on frequency one   michelle can you read me  copy  ok shes in were moving into position now  is there something i
