federalagent jack bauer and today is the longest day ofmy life  listen up people listen up  alexis drazen was leaving for a meeting at this meeting he was gonna make a payoff  so somewhere in this room there is money l want it found and l want it found now   elizabeth cant be held responsible for this  l dont disagree  but we have a tape of her plunging a letter opener into a mans stomach   you got her into this  no sir l did not  l did not ask her to stab alexis drazen  l misjudged her ability to handle the stress of this and as l said l will do all l can to help  l know youre just trying to protect me  senator l understand the situation that youre in  but l do not need to remind you that there are at least two suspects at large  sir please l implore you have as much security around you as you can tolerate  and let us do our job   keep me posted  yes sir l promise l will  nina they need to bag all this as evidence   nina ok all this needs to be included  15 minutes team gotta be ready to go   man bingo  nina found it   what  bearer bonds  as good as cash and easier to move got the address of the restaurant yet   california plaza lts 20 minutes from here  good  how are you gonna pull this off pretending to be alexis  l dont know yet hey jake  jake come here give me your shirt   lm going with you coordinate your backup  fine   whats the update on bauers family  still missing  anything back from forensics yet  based on preliminary reports it looks like the agents were killed protecting the women  we have to find the wife and daughter l alerted a task force over at district  call and see if they need anything else from our end   all right  tony  still no word to jack on any of this understand  what do you want me to tell him if he calls and asks  tell him youre workin on somethin else and put him through to me all right  what are you lookin for  whoever dan was working for might have information about my mom  this guy who was in charge  gaines ld never met him before dan knew him   maybe his numbers here  what are you gonna do  call him and ask for your mom back  any information l find lm gonna give it to the police  you hear that rick shes gonna call the police ls that ok with you   l thought you said you dont trust the police  whatever lll give it to my dad  danll go ballistic when he finds out you guys have been going through his stuff   you didnt tell her dans dead  not yet l dont wanna freak her out  besides dans brother frank is on his way here and l dont want him to know   dont say anything ok  ok  kim sighs  this is such a waste of time were never gonna find anything  l dont even know why l came  youre married you have a daughter named kimberly   l have a daughter  yes  a teenage daughter  you and jack you were separated about six months ago thats when we met   who are you  lm a friend  a very good friend   who wanted to be a lot more  but  you were afraid to start a relationship so we didnt  then you decided to go back with your husband  maybe it was because of kimberly l dont know  but you asked me not to call and l havent  l l dont remember any of this  we need to get you to a hospital have you looked at   why you said you were a doctor  lm a surgeon you need a neurologist   youve suffered some trauma  l dont wanna go to a hospital   why not  l dont know l just dont want to  what if l examined you here  ok  carl there is some physical evidence in george ferragamos office  that leads directly to you  subtle enough so the fire marshals didnt find it the first time  but with a little help theyll find it   keith so lll be framed for his murder  like l said whatever it takes  l dont know what you think you got  what weve got is a tape of carl webb admitting that he set my son up for murder  lts a while since lve practised law  but l know that unless keith was sanctioned by a court order  and prepped by an authority this is not evidence  lve been in politics long enough to know that if the media gets hold of this tape  the truth will come out  no today cant be about two things david  lts either about winning the primary securing the party nomination  or its about a political scandal but it cant be about both   destroy the tape  what  lf you dont not only will you bring down yourself  but youll bring the entire party down   how do l do that  because youre gonna win today  youll have enough delegates by eight oclock  you are the democratic partys candidate for president whether you like it or not  and if you decide to selfdestruct it will take years for the partys platform to recover  whoa whoa whoa whoa why dont we let the electorate decide on that  and l dont consider telling the truth selfdestructive  and how bad will it be for the democrats  if somebody else comes out with this first and l have to go on the defensive  what do you think mike  lve seen much uglier stories kept under wraps  the only people who know about this tape are the people in this room and keith  this would not be a difficult item to shelve  and besides this is currency  once you get into the white house this could protect you   how  well think about it  youll have evidence against some of the most powerful men in the country  they wont be able to control you david   tony its jack hows everything going  fine  l need to speak to mason hes not in his office   hes on the floor let me transfer you  ok wait  before you do have you spoken to teri yet   no  give me the number ofthe safe house   lll call over there myself  look let me see if l can get that for you  hang on a second   whats up  jacks on the phone he wants you   ok  and he wants the number of the safe house   of course he does  look   why not tell him what happened  why is this so difficult to comprehend  the man is neckdeep in an investigation he has a job to do lets let him do it  we get him to a controlled environment we can tell him meanwhile we have a job to do  l gotta say l just think its wrong  lts not about right and wrong lts about the fact that we have a priority to protect palmer  hes on line two   jack its me where are you  were on our way to a meet   what kind of meet  alexis was supposed to make a payoff   a payoff to who  lm not sure yet   so what are you gonna do  pretend to be alexis  oh jack youre never gonna pull that off  alexis was supposed to pay this guy 50000 in bearer bonds  george youre gonna have to work with me on this l need backup  milos got the address we should be there in about 15 minutes  you keep this guy in play we got a chance of bringing these guys down  otherwise you can wait

did teri say  she didnt say much  once she guessed that youd been seeing me she didnt wanna talk to me  not that l blame her but l couldnt finish the debrief  l left and let paulson do it maybe that was a mistake  no you did the right thing this is my fault l should have told her   sounds like she didnt wanna talk about it  doesnt matter l still should have told her  jack from what l could see she really loves you and wants to work it out   maybe you wanna call and see how she is  l tried mason said they were sleeping  you know why dont you call paulson and see if theyre up yet   lts not
