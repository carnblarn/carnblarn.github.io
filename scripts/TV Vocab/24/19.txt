taking jacks side in the separation  you didnt wanna give her any more reason to be angry with you  and why did my husband jack why did jack leave me  you asked him to  you told me he was too removed  there was no connection between you two any more  how about you and l   l thought there was one  but what l didnt  truth is l think you did  but you were scared you didnt wanna lose your family  and

looking at what l did for the last few months it doesnt mean anything to me  yvonnes birthday kim in cambria for the weekend  dinner with phil lvy at the shore  was it nice  well the wait was over an hour so  we decided to walk down the pier and have some hot dogs  and you beat me at air hockey  air hockey huh  whats in there for today  nothing although yesterday l had a conference call with kitty whoever that is  kitty  shes a friend of yours you work with her sometimes  you do commercial interior design lts just freelance right now  but you wanna expand when kim goes off to college  how come l can sort of remember air hockey but l cant remember what l do for a living  doorbell rings   maybe thats jack  he wouldnt ring the bell  lts probably my friend chris remember l wanted someone here to be on the safe side   yeah  stay here just in case   man hey phil  phil hey chris thanks for coming   teri this is chris  hi   why does he have a gun  hes here to  l dont care get him outta the house with that gun  chris will you just give us a couple of minutes ok   yeah sure  thanks   teri chris is a friend of mine  that doesnt mean anything to me  l dont know who you are l dont know who he is l dont want any guns  ok lll tell him to stay outside ls that ok  but we need him here just in case  teri your husband could have been the one who roughed you up  l want you safe  teri look at me  look at me  lm your friend  you trust me you told me so yourself  so youre gonna have to trust my judgment  ok   andre whats going on over there  the wife is here   the daughter  no   what are you waiting for  theres a little interference  but itll pass soon didyou findalexis  not yet   call me when its done  yes  woman ladies and gentlemen of the press if you will please take your seats now  senator palmer is just about here we will begin  man senator palmer  last night l received a phone call regarding my son keith  and my daughter nicole  that call has unfortunately set offa chain ofevents that has culminated in a tragedy  whether or not what l have to say jeopardises my campaign is for the voters to decide  lm doing this for my family  a large portion ofthe financial support for my campaign  comes from a group ofbusinessmen right here in los angeles   every presidential campaign relies on  lll take care of it  too late carl  l have apparently misjudged these local businessmen  more importantly they have misjudged me  palmer how it was acquired l am not at liberty to say  l have already handed this incriminating tape over to the justice department  whether or not its admissible in court  it will still implicate the men who have been supporting my campaign  lll emphasise again  that these men acted without my consent or my knowledge  as for my son keith  he is prepared to turn himselfin and face any consequences a grandjury deems necessary  he is my son and l love him  and l will stand by him  l am confident that when presented with the facts  it will be clear that there was no criminal intent or wrongdoing  he will only be guilty ofnot reporting an accident  as for my daughter nicole  it is important for everyone to remember she was the victim of a horrible crime  a physical and psychological crime  she is not a source ofinformation  this is about the coverup ofan accidental death  this is not about rape  so lm asking you now as a father please find your humanity  and spare nicole the indignity of having to relive this nightmare   man we lost track of both of em  nina how long have you known this   does jack know about this  nina nina   not that lm aware of  did you know the safe house was hit   relax ok  tony answer me   yes l knew  why didnt you tell me  look mason didnt want you to know cos he didnt want you to tell jack  his family is missing he should know that  yeah lm with you on this look mason gave the order all right  hes deployed resources hes called locals to help find em  you should have told me you work for me  and you work for mason  this is my fault l should never have left teri and kim  nina youre not a field agent all right what could you have done  jack needs to know about this  phone rings   mason  have you told jack about his family yet   no were not there yet  you cant do this you have to tell him   uhhuh  let him know so he can help us find them  theyre exposed lf drazens people find them first   thats a good idea  listen to me george  lf anything happens to them hes gonna hold you responsible think about that  l will ok let me know if you have any progress  george  nina  jack my battery just died can l use your phone for a sec  yeah sure  thanks  ringing tone  yeah its me no all l wanna say is keep the backup units on standby all right  woman the cellular customer you are trying to reach is unavailable   ok  l got a signal   whatd nina have to say  shes just checking our location  what does gps say  lt doesnt make sense lts saying the address is right up ahead  l know the whole thing was hushhush but who was victor drazen  drazen was milosevics shadow he was in charge of all of his covert operations  he was responsible for organising the ethnic cleansing campaigns in kosovo sarajevo  and bosnia   your unit took him out  thats right   you rolled the whole deal up  yeah  so whod have the kind of influence to run an operation like this against you and palmer  my guess would be serbian military exiles they could pull this off  alexis and andre pulled together a cell without us knowing  lts a hell of a cell to be able to infiltrate the ctu turn jamey  l agree lts hard to believe jamey could work against us without some kind of umbrella  any ideas why the serbs would wanna spend this much money  to turn the power off in the middle of the woods  no  george look a power transformer  the lock on its new  why would this be designated as a wildlife sanctuary think about it  theres no water no water no wetlands no wetlands no birds no animals  no nothing as far as l can make out  knock on door  here they are man lets get ready  right on time l like that   who the hells this  just some friends of mine lts cool  how you know frankie  lm a friend of ricks  whos rick   l

hospitals  yes  l dont understand how teri and kim just disappeared  well it might be a good thing lf drazens people had them wed have heard about it  after all jack and palmer are the primary targets   what about jacks house  l sent williams over but lll check on him   and kims phone call  a phone booth were checking the area  look nina were doing everything we can right  are you  what you gonna

presidents duty an elected representatives duty  is not only to his country  but also to his family  lf he cannot manage the interactions of the people close to him  then he cant expect the electorate to believe in his abilities to lead a nation  l dont deny l made a mistake  a serious one  l only ask you to consider that l am not the first person in public office to make one  thank you  l love you
