maureen  were not in court here lm just an old friend  with a career and family that you just may destroy  you owe me that much at least  ok  two sources  one a man named george ferragamo  he was your sons therapist for four years  he came to me with the story  and the second source  the boy who raped your daughter then threw himself off the balcony  lyle gibson  his autopsy showed that he had cuts and scratches that pointed to a violent struggle  nicole tried to fight him off  yes that was the explanation  but an hour later an africanamerican teenage boy went to an emergency room  one block away with similar injuries  the name here says edward johnson  the handwriting where he filled out the form and signed his name  l had it analysed by an expert  lts your sons  l dont give a damn about your expert my son never killed anybody   senator l would never  you do what you have to do maureen  just be prepared to accept the consequences  tv truth in the rumour that the pentagon wastefully dumped military supplies  costing millions perhaps billions oftaxpayer dollars  in the years since the vietnam war started  the spokesman who declined to be interviewed on camera  states only that in the hurlyburly ofwar  and the constant movement ofperimeters and people  one must expect that there would be a certain amount  ofacceptable loss ofsupplies and armaments  hey dad  somethin wrong  l guess youll have to tell me  the night your sister was raped did you have any contact with the boy who raped her   what  you heard me  l l dont believe this l mean  what brought this up all of a sudden  l mean lets just leave that all in the past where it belongs  ld like to believe me  but as it happens l cant  what did you do that night after you found out that nicole had been attacked  the truth now all of it  l dont think you have a right to ask me that   you dont think l have the right  no l dont  see this thing happened somebody had to deal with it  but you were in chicago givin a speech or new york  well deal with my shortcomings as a father later  now l wanna know what you did after you found out your sister had been raped   and l told you lm not gonna answer  you will answer me  l apologise about bauer  but ld really appreciate it if we could handle this internally  l got no problem with that  sergeant excuse me but if our federal colleagues are through with penticoff   ld like to process him into the system  why are you here l thought you left  lm not leaving till penticoff is behind bars without bail  the computer says you left five minutes ago  mason all right guys were on the move  damn it  l got this notice in the mail this afternoon  actually it was yesterday afternoon  kimberly was failing algebra  lt was the second notice she intercepted the first one and threw it away  when she got home l was so mad at her  l guess l accused her and l l said things to her l shouldnt have said  there isnt a parent in the world who hasnt been there  last night when l told her good night she wouldnt even acknowledge me  l actually had the thought that ld be  ld be so glad when she got out of the house  when janet wakes up shell know where kim is and then well find her   l just hope itll be that easy  lt will  but why wasnt she with janet lt doesnt make any sense   maybe she got freaked out by the accident  we shouldve waited   we shouldve waited  no no no
