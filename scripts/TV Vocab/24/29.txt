dismiss me now sir  i need someone i can trust  reza may be involved with a terrorist  hes been in contact with someone who finances terrorist operations  trust me he is not a terrorist  i wantyou to drop this nonsense and start treating reza like a member of the family   how bad is she  she needs surgery   we cant do that in the field  george we cant keep her here  everything on this nuke has been destroyed apart from the database paula sent the nsa   and they didnt get the code  assign other it people to retrieve it  we dont have time   i wanna go with her  i have some questions first  we got out in time she wasnt injured in the explosion  her head injury most likely occurred before the blast   you dont think i did this  im gonna let the police sort that out  eddie said the job went off without a hitch what happened between then and now  i killed them for resisting arrest ill kill you too joe  whoever setyou up to do this job joe they used you  the woman who gave me the plans to ctu i only met her twice  i cant go backto jail  no  none of these girders are stable i cant guarantee theyre gonna hold  and nothing behind this corded areas safe  if i see anyone in here ill shut the building down  i dont care what the governor says  no dont even try that the switches were totally destroyed  see if you can set up a generator line to the alsland  paramedic we gotta get her outta here  progress here  were trying to bring her round using stimulants and hydrating fluids   but it might make her more unstable  were running out of time wake her up   where are you headed  to follow up on a lead  theres an la connection to syed ali  well look send somebody else i need you here  to do what watch paula die  we gotta get the encryption codes out of her or we lose everything  you got it covered ill follow up on this lead  no youre gonna stay here and thats an order  be reachable all right   what are you looking at  nothing   you putting bandaids on the network  yeah im on it  mr mason its jack bauer   jack what is it  george i got to wald  i found out who commissioned him to take out ctu   who  it was nina myers   nina  she was his connection to ctu  it makes no sense shes been in prison  he approached her before we took her down she sold him schematics gate information  this has to be connected to the nuke  they bombed ctu to cripple our response capability  yes yes ive already called chappelle   you what  i couldnt find you george   what did he say  he agreed we need to talkto her  hes having her transferred over to ctu nowfor questioning  debrief at division its a total disaster here   what are you gonna do about nina  ill take care of it   dont just hand her over to the fbi  forget it jack you did a great job  ok go find yourself someplace safe  george  michelle can you get somebody to set up an interrogation room   we got somebody coming in  who   nina myers  the ctu agent that killed jacks wife  i need as close to maximum security as i can get   and three armed agents standing by  weve reduced the likelihood on some of the targets were left with six probable sectors  the harbour port of los angeles one of the busiest ports in the world  a strike there will knock out infrastructure  sorry to interrupt mr president but the ambassadors about to land   any communication while he was en route  not since this morning   when it was decided

the police that it was just a misunderstanding  if you dont theyre gonna arrestyou   arrest me for what  for kidnapping my daughter  where is carla  as soon as these officers talkto the doctor itll be pretty obvious that you hurt her  thats a lie and you know it i would never hurt her  ive been protecting her from you  the only thing that can be proved kim  is thatyou took megan without our permission  you beat up your wife whos gonna believe you  carla will back me up you knowthat  i mean if you dont believe me  you can give her a call  wanna do that  go ahead kim call her  you walk

hate to meddle in your rice bowl  but on a day like today i couldnt wait for you to arrive   say no more  are you caught up on everything  caught up  id like to talkto you about this meeting with the ambassador   what are your thoughts  we have everything to lose nothing to gain  what we have to gain is stopping the nuclear bomb  but this meeting benefits only the other side  he wants to be able to say to the world look we tried to stop the bomb  its a ploy to gain access to our intelligence nothing more  you might be right but im not as certain as you are   im gonna meet with him  very good sir   anything else  not at this time  hold on sir offduty agents are finally arriving  and division called the chopper just lifted off nina myers is on board  good lets set up the mobile video unit

the house   you knew about it  of course  why do you think i insisted you go with him  dad its not that i think reza doesnt love marie   but if hes doing things that are illegal  you dont knowthat  i know ralph burton found a transaction in the company records   that links him to a known terrorist  ralph burton is a pi  he could probably connect me to the manson family if he looked hard enough   did they straighten out that lunch business  yeah another crisis averted   whos this  hello sir  im tony almeida from los angeles ctu   this is agent richards  ctu what what is ctu  counter terrorist unit  im looking for a reza naiyeer   whats this all about  its a government matter maam   a government matter  i just need to ask him a few questions  mr almeida right  my daughter hired a private investigator to do a background check on reza   its all been cleared up  actually dad it hasnt all been cleared up  can this wait you see today is my other daughter maries wedding  shes getting married to reza  im sorry for the bad timing mr warner  but no this cant wait  im authorised to interrogate mr naiyeer  are you gonna take me to him or do i have to find him myself  kate go find reza   whats going on here  im part of an investigation  involving national security  im hoping mr naiyeer can assist me  hi kate  whats up   theres a man here who needs to talkto you  who is he  hes from the government   the government  a counterterrorism agency   what are you talking about  thats all i know  whats this about kate  i dont know  maries in her room adjusting her dress  just make sure she doesnt find out about this  sure   reza naiyeer  yes  im agent richards right this way  oh what is that   some lunch for you  can you put it there  i wantyou to knowthat since your conversation with the prime minister  we have taken four suspected members of second wave into custody  and we have begun interrogations   what have you learned  we are still questioning them  as a ranking security officer i assure you  we are doing all we can to clamp down on this kind of activity  these satellite photos were taken over your country an hour ago  doesnt look like too much of a clampdown to me  we dont have the resources thatyou do and surely even you cant tell me  thatyou are aware of every single active paramilitary compound in the us  if this bomb goes off mr president  and you dont believe that we did everything possible to stop it  there will be heavy repercussions for my country  you have already made it clear thatyou will have no choice but to retaliate against us  we want to help   what do you propose  a mutual exchange of intelligence   what kind of exchange  we need access   to your files on second wave  our files  yes anything that pertains to suspected terrorism in our country  im not sure how much intel its in our interest to share with you at this time  i understand your reservations mr president  but be assured we want to prevent this incident  we are prepared for an exchange in both directions  we are willing to open up our files to you as well   ill have to think about this mr ambassador  of course  we prepared a room for you youll have our answer shortly  thank you mr president   mr ambassador  mr stanton  right this way sir   we cant give them this information sir  explain whats the downside  we have agents in their country right now   those files would expose their identities  fine  go through the files take out anything that would jeopardise our people   its a dangerous precedent  we cant worry about precedent not today  not under the threat of nuclear attack  i guess my point is i dont trust the ambassador  and we cant ignore the possibility that his country is supporting second wave  lynne what do you think  i agree with roger i think its too risky  rings   yeah  dad its me   kim are you all right  im ok what aboutyou   were you at ctu when the bomb went off  no honey im fine   are you on your way to aunt carols
