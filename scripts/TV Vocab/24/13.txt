already covered up one death  no you dont know about ferragamo  but even if youre right  will turning this into a media circus bring him back to life   thats not the point  your career and your family  youre youre throwing away everything youve built  without any hard evidence of what really happened  the police will find the evidence  no they wont because carl and the people he works for  they will twist the system to get the result that they want  thats what they do david  and youll be left with nothing  sweetheart to fight these people you need power  the kind of power youll have once you become president  we knew from the start that this was going to be an uphill race  but were almost there  look at the polls   sherry l dont know  no think david think  think of the millions of lives

vasquez  your daughter was a traitor   what  she confessed before she died  and if you withhold information you can be held as an accomplice  lf that happens whos gonna take care of kyle  what do you want to know  lrs records show you earn 45000 a year  but an account in your name shows a series of deposits adding up to more than 300000  lts lts from jamey  so that kyle would have enough money in case something happened to her  who gave jamey the money   she never said  and you never asked  all this money in your account and you never once asked where it came from  kyle needs you  dont do anything to jeopardise that  maxton and neill youre the only two who havent checked in yet where are you  one more time maxton and neill   this is maxton  where are you why havent you called in  were

see that youre protected  l have protected myself  maureen youre withholding evidence in a capital crime  what evidence dr ferragamo is dead  his files have been destroyed   but the piece of paper with keiths writing  there is no piece of paper  not any more  theres still my word lt counts for something  lts not enough senator  not against these people  lm sorry   theres no radio  bauers been listening  to every damn word  mrs vasquez has received two wire transfers since january  both from a holding company called luca univox based in belgrade  jack suggested a connection to belgrade   he was on assignment there two years ago  did you check for a connection to the hit  these new files may give us a new angle  so who do we know in belgrade whos keyed into the financial community  come

l like you david l really do  and l think you would make one hell of a commander in chief  l know what you did to ferragamo  every engine produces waste lts the physics of the situation   listen to yourself  consider the alternatives  a year from now youll either be promoting your agenda for the nation  or visiting your son in prison   a jury will believe that it was an accident  lm not talking about the rapist david  lm talking about dr ferragamo   keith had nothing to do with ferragamo  of course he didnt  but if somebody were to mention the word arson  you son of a bitch  you planted something  the people we both work for david they know how to get what they want  hi mike  what was that all about  the das waiting in there what do you want me to say  tell him lm sorry  l have

funds to belgrade  belgrade  before l tell you upgrade the threat assessment on palmer   you need to give me more than that  the same account shows a transfer of funds  to an assassin based in belgrade  thats old news the photographer  no our contact over there says this assassin left yugoslavia this morning  which means hes probably already here   a second hitter  mmhm
