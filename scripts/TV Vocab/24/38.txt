                theres no chance that this bomb is ever gonna go off  with a special ops team following it every step of the way  jack bauer found the coral snake commandos  all six members of the team had been killed  if theres something that you havent told me  ask sherry shes the one you wanna talk to  my father works for the government  he said someones gonna detonate a nuclear bomb in los angeles today   im gonna show you something  what is it  its a bomb shelter   it happened  the bomb went off  the radiation we gotta get down below before its too late   hello  there has been a change of plans  why whats going on  marie our mission depends on you now im counting on you  theyre a rogue unit acting on their own authority   how do i find them  somewhere at the airport  our best bet is still you getting past them to the bomb  there is a nuclear warhead somewhere onsite  there it is go go  put your hands above your head keep em there  this isnt a bomb its been rigged to look like one  this is not the bomb this is a decoy  i repeat we are still looking for the nuclear device  ok lets go easy with this  go  you have to process the prints here bring in your mobile equipment  you wheres the real bomb wheres the real bomb  do you understand me do you speak any english  do you speak any english   search him ill get us a translator  yes sir  this is jack bauer requesting a translator in hangar 21  i repeat i am requesting a translator in hangar 21  mr mason jack bauer is on line two  good   george  hows the search going over there jack  still no new leads on where the bomb is  what about that plane you found the decoy in  its clean use reversetime satellite to trace the plane to its original location  thats where they wouldve loaded the decoy find out who the players are  here and here  george you with me  george can you hear me are you all right   yeah  george  yeah im on it reversetime satellite yeah  im really sorry about everything thats happened to you today  but if you cant think clearly you need to let someone else take over command   there isnt anybody else jack  what about tony  i got it together i can handle it all right  yeah ok   we do have another problem  what  the six dead commandos you found turns out a seventh may have escaped  i examined all the gunshot wounds  three of the commandos knew the shooter  their wounds were at close range  the others showed signs of a struggle which indicates they had time to react   so the seventh didnt escape  right he was a shooter  i gotta go get me an id on the seventh commando as soon as you can   im working on it  good   what do you got  a wallet no id no credit cards  he wants to talk where the hell is my translator  mr warner its your daughter kate   kate  dad   kate where are

elaborate  thats all he said  they said it was urgent is it about the bomb have they found it  not yet sit down  i just spoke with stanton he confesses that hes known about the bomb for weeks  for weeks why would he withhold that from you  he wanted to wait until the bomb was on us soil before he intercepted it   so he knows where the bomb is  the men he had tracking it did  but theyre all dead the bombs still out there and we dont know where it is  oh my god oh my god  am i telling you something you already know   what  tell me now  have you done the unthinkable and put yourself in league with roger stanton  thats outrageous of course not what did he say  sit down   david  sit down  he said you were involved working against me  hes lying david i never even met roger stanton until this afternoon   thats not true  hes playing you  whatever hes doing he wants you to believe i  just stop it  sherry right now we are teetering on the brink of a war  that will lead to the deaths of millions of people  we have to stop this disaster today right now before it begins  if there is something youre not telling me anything that could help us find this bomb  as president of the united states i order you  no as someone that you claim you love  im asking help me sherry  i got a phone call a few months ago in the middle of the night  from a friend of mine whos high up in nsa  he told me that roger stanton wanted to speak to me first thing in the morning  and so we met at a park in virginia  what did he want   he wanted to recruit me  to do what  he wanted to know who was loyal to you and who could be turned  he wanted he wanted to know where you were weak  and you told him  yes  but i only did it to gain his confidence  i was not aligning myself with him i was doing it for you  david i know you dont believe me but just give me 30 minutes  to prove to you that im telling the truth  that i did all of this to protect you  not to hurt you  i think hes saying he did it for his family they promised him money  ask him who they is  syed ali  ask him if he knows about a second bomb  eh  i dont think that was right i think we have different dialects  it doesnt matter just keep
