culminates in the interception of the nuclear device  youll be pardoned in advance for the murder of jack bauer  mr president there was only one right choice to make and you made it  youve been told by a wellrespected member of the press mr ron wieland  that there is an imminent terrorist threat levelled against this country  that is true so far as it goes  please  the fact is we get a dozen such threats every day  and do i know more about them than i publicly reveal of course  what is released to the public and when is a matter of judgement  you have elected me to exercise that judgement  in the best interests of this country  thats what ive done since i took office thats what im doing today  and i can assure you that we have the situation well under control  and there is no cause for alarm  thank you  not the gettysburg address but it should buy us time  it was fine   whats the situation with jack bauer  still being held hostage by nina myers  it didnt have to be like this jack i never meant for it to be personal  it felt pretty personal when you killed my wife  i had to teri overheard something that compromised my escape route  what about bombing ctu all those people you used to work with  i didnt bomb ctu i just sold the plans  you believe what you have to but you killed your friends  shut up jack shut up  now we are done talking  were just gonna wait for palmer to call and then thisll all be over you got it  you know what nina youre right i dont really wanna just sit here and wait to die  dont move jack  i mean it  you kill me before they verify the information youll be in violation of your agreement   theyll just slap your ass back in jail  and youll be dead  im already dead  last warning jack  thats it one more step and ill shoot  argh   team one move in go  go go go   move move move  grab her  secure the weapon  got it   notify the chopper  get her up   lets go  were not going back to la  weve been through this   i told you before  i know the bomb

awaiting orders do you want her taken to prison  no well honour our original deal  ill pardon her as soon as we confirm her information   in the meantime where do you want her  los angeles  let her share the fate of everyone shes endangered  yes sir  thats affirmative ill meet the chopper just south of the gully in the field   roger that  copy  now  were here to find transactions you claim bob warner had with syed ali  the sooner we do that the sooner were out of here  have a seat   i cant work like this  ill be keying the computer  how do i open the invoice files   what  i need to access the invoice files   file open warehouse  how are they ordered   chronologically i think  you think  look my fiance just left me on my wedding day because im sending her father to jail  and since hes my employer that pretty much means my whole lifes in the toilet  so why dont you cut me some slack  theres a nuke somewhere in this city  and if you dont give me something useful in the next hour  ill take you back to ctu and chain you to the roof  so youll have a front row seat when the damn thing goes off  do you want to suffer as he did  no of course not  then tell me what youve learned from your fathers computer files  who you told  i already told you i dont know anything  jack bauer  jack  mr president the soldiers that attacked us at the crash site  they were americans or at least american trained  what  one of the soldiers that was killed had a tattoo of a coral snake on his arm  thats a signature of a group out of fort benning   what sort of group  a deep cover special ops unit  the only reason i know about the tattoos  is because early in my career they tried to recruit me  their commander is a colonel samuels   ive never heard of this unit  no you wouldnt have thats the point  theyd be buried pretty heavily in nsas budget  nsa  ok  even if nsa originally trained him isnt it possible hes freelancing now a mercenary  if it was just the tattoo id agree with you  but the men that attacked us had access to our flight plan  the only way they could have got that information was from on the inside  mr president i know it sounds very farfetched that we got attacked by americans  but that tattoo is very distinctive and very specific  i appreciate the information where are you now  were in a chopper were on our way to the address that nina meyers provided for us  we should be touching down soon sir our eta is 15 minutes   keep me posted jack  yes mr president  jacks on his way to the syed ali house do you want a feed up here  no i assume you have that under control  yeah we do  was there something else  im sorry  so what are you gonna do tomorrow   what  if the bomb doesnt go off  thought about it  no  youll probably come back to work here  of course why wouldnt i  i dont know are you happy in this job hm  believe it or not i used to want to be a teacher a long time ago  you know why i didnt  cos dod offered me more money thats how i made my decision  so i made myself miserable  and i made everybody else around me miserable for an extra 5000 a year  that was my price  sorry  you know michelle im not a big advice giver  but under the circumstances  dont wait around for your life to happen to you  find something that makes you happy do it  because everything else is all just background noise   roger  mr president  tell me everything you know about colonel ron samuels from fort benning  i dont know anything about samuels  what about a special ops units from down there called coral snake  no sir nothing  how could nsa be funding a paramilitary group and you not know about it  without knowing specifics i really cant say for sure  my guess is that the department of defense  has used some of their discretionary resources  attached our name for budgetary purposes it happens all the time  thats absurd nsa is information gathering only they have no military mandate  id assume that this coral snake group  like many others that we see  falls under somebodys pet project gets funded on the sly  how would you know that roger a minute ago you told me youd never heard of them  im just conjecturing from past experience mr president  i have no concrete information let me look into it  you do that  jack bauers plane was shot down by an american military unit  jack told me himself i wont go into details except to say that i believe him  american military why  i just spoke to roger stanton  i think hes hiding something from me im going to arrest him  arrest the head of nsa  bauer said the unit that attacked his plane is connected to a colonel samuels  samuels is funded by nsa  with all due respect david thats pretty thin  by itself yes  but the ambassadors chopper crash  the evacuation of military personnel out of la  ron wielands escape from custody those things happened after stanton arrived  firing stanton will cause chaos all the agencies report through him  hes running the search for the bomb for crying out loud  if the presidents right hes not running it hes impeding it   why would he do such a thing  i dont know  but if he is we have a better chance of finding the bomb if we get rid of him  david  you cant do this on a hunch  if stanton turns out to be innocent and that bomb goes off  youll be blamed for the death of millions  if you do nothing and he is guilty of something youll be blamed anyway  no no no at the very least we need to get some kind of proof some evidence  you cannot just arrest the head of nsa david  sherrys right mike we need proof  find me a connection between stanton and this colonel samuels and find it quickly  la county 470 go ahead  this is officer brown with valley im trying to reach detective bill gucoff  brown youre transporting two suspects down to central   mmhm thats right  hold on ill patch you through   gucoff here  hey bill   yeah  im bringing the prisoners down   all right you got everything under control  the guy gave us trouble   what  get the bandanna out of my pocket   why  to start a fire  what youre crazy  hell have to pull over and stop the car   and then hell put it out then what  i dont know  maybe itll do enough damage and well have to go back to the station itll buy us time  that is just crazy  crazier than going to los angeles where a nuclear bomb might go off any minute  hey listen this may sound a little crazy  but did you happen to hear anything about some kind of a bomb threat today  what  i cant do this you gotta do it   no  kim you can do it youre smaller  no i havent heard anything   come on  you sure  why somebody tell you there was a bomb or something  whats going on you know something that i dont whats up  i dont know it may be nothing but one of the kids here  apparently her father works for ctu  he gave her some kind of information about a bomb  just check it out for me like i said its probably nothing but  no problem  ok gucoff thanks i owe you one   kim  hang on ok   hello can anyone hear me  this is chp

yes sir  you should drink some water  kate my name is jack bauer im a federal agent  youve been through an ordeal but i have to ask you a few questions is that all right   how did you get here  um  i was trying to help my sister  so i hired a private investigator those men thought we knew something  slow down slow down the dead man in the other room was a private investigator  paul koplin  what they did to him  they there was more than one man here how many men were there  two the other one left before you came  did you get his name   syed ali  are you sure  can you describe him for me  tall thin  do you remember what he was wearing  a black shirt with silver buttons down the front  black pants  do you remember what kind of a car he got into do you know where he was going  excuse me for one moment  baker this is agent bauer  syed ali is still alive we are looking for a middle eastern man wearing all black  i didnt get a make on the car send out an apb   we need to find him now  copy  kate you said you came here to help your sister who is she  marie marie warner  she was supposed to get married today  tell mike what you told me  theres a backchannel communications network the cia used to use called opcom  its been shut down for over 20 years  last month nsa was given orders to resurrect it  it was an eyesonly order issued by roger stanton   im not sure thats enough  by itself its not  unless stanton used opcom to contact colonel samuels in the last few hours  my source is checking on that now  mike call the attorney general start working on this from the legal side  if we find this connection well move on it have stanton arrested  i think we got a positive id crossreference his prints with the name paul koplin   ctu  bauer put me through to tony  hold please   its tony whats up  im still at the house  i just questioned the woman that ali was torturing for information  her name is kate warner run a background check   did you say kate warner  yeah why  i had her family picked up this morning i was with her hours ago   whats the connection  reza naiyeer  her sisters fianc had dealings with syed ali  hes denying it he says it was the father bob warner  richards took naiyeer to bob warners office to hack into his computer  i have warner here with me right now  jack will kate talk to you cos her familys not cooperating  yeah but i gotta give her time shes been through hell you should see this place  jack theres one more thing  what  the father bob warner he freelances for the cia  were gonna have to start from the beginning youll have to run everything again  start connecting the dots these people are involved you gotta find out how   get back to me when youve got anything  all right you got it  gentlemen i need you to pack up i need the room   agent baker  baker here   hows miss warner doing  not so good  as soon as you think shes ready bring her down to the bathroom  will do baker out  those three dates and anything the following week hold on  ok good let me know as soon as you find something out thanks   sir  what have we got   i found a way into the opcom channels  good tunnel in  the problem is the files are pass code protected  well need someone internal to open them itll take time  hold no its not  i just got the name of a deputy director whos retired but his code is still active  we could use that  jean could you hold on for a sec uhhuh lets see   try this it should work im back  ill head over to the oc and check it out   good  oh thats terrific  jean im gonna crossreference these but i need you to stay in the office   no problem  right ok thanks bye  im collecting the dates that samuels office logged onto opcom  if mike can trace stantons access we can look for a match   thats great  if we have that youll have the proof  stanton has a dozen staff who share his code how are we gonna pin it on him  theres a fourdigit subcode that only belongs to him thats the one thatll nail him   sherry  yes  youre doing an incredible job here today  thank you  id forgotten how talented you are at all this stuff  david ive worked with you for over 25 years  it had to rub off on me somehow  im glad youre here  i have always been here  you remember that  yeah  all right call me if theres anything   that was barbara at the warner office  whatd they find  nothing yet theyre still going through the records reza seems to be cooperating  this is driving me crazy  it doesnt make sense that syed ali has a connection to this whitebread family  so you believe bob warner  theres nothing in his profile or behaviour that suggests hes involved with terrorists  i agree but look at the facts  there is a paper trail between warner investments and ali  kate warner was abducted for a reason  i know  look put together a list of all the managers and directors of bob warners company   i want to widen the search a notch  good idea  anything else  yeah  i was talking to mason before and  and  this is hardly the time but i dont know how much time we have  so i just wanted you to know that if you wanted to go out sometime   michelle  i just wanted you to know how i felt  no michelle  i feel the same way  ive just been keeping my distance because  because of what happened between you and nina  yeah  so you think i just want you for your information  so what are we saying here then  if we save la from a nuclear bomb  then you and i can get together for dinner and a movie is that it   ill get that list  yeah thats  syed ali left after he killed mr koplin  they talked for a minute or two  they looked at me a couple of times  it was like like i wasnt important any more  they embraced and he left  did they say anything to each other when he was leaving  yes but they spoke so softly  and mostly in arabic  arabic how can you be so sure  my family lived in saudi arabia when i was younger  when my sister got engaged to reza i picked it up again  can you identify any words that they said anything at all  salat they said salat several times it means prayer  but i couldnt really hear anything they were so soft  baker this is jack get ahold of ctu  i want a list of every mosque in a 15mile radius   mosques  they talked about prayer before ali left   the time fits  roger that   did that help  yes  yes i think it did  ok  kate the normal protocol would be to transfer you back to ctu for further debriefing  but the truth is i dont know what syed ali looks like  no one does except for you  i need you to identify him for me   stanton  its me  excuse me   you know better than to call me here  they know about opcom   how  i told them   what  david had the bit between his teeth  he was gonna find out one way or another  this way i get him trusting me again little by little   what do we do now  theyll connect you to the plane  davids having an arrest warrant drawn up as we speak  stay the course roger when this is over youll have everything you want  while in the meantime its important that you dont talk   dont talk about you  thats right  its more important than ever that i stay in place   how much time do i have  not much  hold on  heres the shipping order it was entered last january   bob and i were both in europe then  so he logged on from overseas  thats not possible its not international but it didnt originate from this terminal either  somebody hacked in  hold on this cant be i set up this program on my own computer   you said you were out of the country  i left my laptop here  who else had access to it  nobody  except  marie  i didnt expect you to find anything  i underestimated you  well then the last two years have just been  its just been an act is that it i mean nothing to you  huh  i dont understand say something marie  reza you really are very sweet
