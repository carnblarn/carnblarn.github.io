well be able to track every move that he makes  without exposing ourselves at all   where do l put it  preferably his wallet  hell have it on him at all times even if he changes clothes  as soon as you plant this device lll call you on your cellphone  l will tell you the senator is waiting for you you make your excuses and you get out   so l plant the tracker the phone rings  and then youll leave   ok  one more thing  lf at any point you think hes suspicious or youre uncomfortable in any way  all you have to do is utter the words l hope lm not getting a cold   l hope lm not getting a

she asked me pointblank l couldnt deny it she would have known  did you tell her that it was over  of course l did  l think she was just shocked that it was me  someone she knows  when teri and l got back together  l tried to talk to her about this but  she said she didnt wanna know so l just let it go  look jack you asked me to go to the safe house so l did   l was just trying to help  l know l

you out of my sight  l must say l do find it a little strange that the senator wouldnt  include someone as smart and capable as you   in his inner circle  how would you know how smart l am  weve spent maybe 15 hours together and most of that has been in bed  that wasnt smart  was that a complaint or a compliment  both l think  l just realised that l havent eaten all day  which may explain why lm in
