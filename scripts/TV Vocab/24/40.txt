                i need to speak with the president  they cant diffuse it well have to fly it out  ground zero has to be a precise location  a pilot will have to go down with the plane its a suicide mission   who ended up flying the plane  jack bauer   get air force one ready as soon as possible  do you mind if i ask where youre going  los angeles   whos he  his name is yusuf auda  his government assigned him as a liaison they helped us get the hard drive from ali  its a recording of a conversation that took place four months ago   conversation between who  ali and highranking government officials  these countries not only knew about the bomb   but they bought it and supplied it to ali  yeah   kim  daddy whats that noise where are you  im in a plane we found the bomb  we needed someone to fly it over the desert so when it exploded nobody would get killed   that someone turned out to be me  no daddy  i love you more than anything in the world goodbye   george what the hell are you doing here  brought something for ya its a parachute  i already told you im taking this plane in  you still got a life jack whats left but going straight and level  and taking it into a dive am i right   you really think you can do this  jack im supposed to do this  oh dad  agent bauer   my orders are to take you back to ctu sir  thats affirmative  lieutenant i need you to get ahold of tony almeida over at ctu tell him that i made it  he needs to get ahold of my daughter tell her im alive  radio transmissions are a nogo and cell sites are down for miles   youll have to wait till we get there  copy  would everyone gather around please this will just take a minute  george mason asked me in advance to thank you all for your dedication  thanks to his sacrifice and your hard work millions of lives were saved  and thats a result that we can be proud of  to say that this has been a long day would be an understatement  and i know youre all tired but this isnt over yet  we still got a lot of work to do the cyprus recording is our primary focus  and thats critical to any military response that washingtons considering  so lets get back at it huh  mr almeida  im supposed to update my office right now  but ive got nothing to report except that ive been excluded from this investigation  look ill tell you what i can when i can  my country permitted your operatives to raid alis apartment  on condition that i would be involved in this investigation  i understand your frustration mr auda  you can call your office and tell them anything you like  but weve got work to do here youre simply not authorised to be part of it   he doesnt look too happy  yeah are the audio guys ready  theyre waiting for you wheres michelle   interrogating ali  why  to see if he can shed any light on the recording we have a meeting  the presidents waiting for confirmation on the recordings authenticity take care of it   yeah  thanks  this tape was recovered from the hard drive in your apartment  its a record of a meeting you had with these three men on april 5 in cyprus  theyre all highranking officials from three arab countries one of them your own  the tape proves you conspired with these men to detonate a nuclear bomb on us soil  were there others present who didnt speak  youll tell the interrogators in guantanamo  under much less comfortable circumstances ill ask you one more time   tell me what you want me to say ill say it  i want the truth  what does the truth matter when you have this recording   explain what that means  i never spoke to any of these men  are you denying that the meeting took place  there was never a meeting i was not even in cyprus in april   where were you  berlin  theyll find out the truth in guantanamo  why would i lie about this when i told you the truth about the bomb  to protect your country  the bomb was a second wave operation only  i have never met those men  agent gibson your team has finished the analysis of the cyprus recording   yes sir  could you walk us through it please  we began by obtaining voice samples for ali and the three government officials  we deconstructed sound waves and isolated unique qualities  the voices on the cyprus audio  are in fact those of syed ali and the three government ministers in question  the recording could have been created by putting pieces of conversations together  yes but reconstruction always leaves artefacts  mismatched acoustical signatures or altered cadences we found no such artefacts  is there any chance that it could have been doctored in a way we couldnt detect  anythings theoretically possible  but i can say with absolute certainty  that the finest experts using the best equipment  cannot find any evidence that this recording  is anything but a genuine and accurate record of an actual conversation  a conversation in which these four men sat in the same room  and conspired to detonate a nuclear bomb on us soil  yes sir  i just finished talking with ali  he claims that hes never even spoken to any of the men in the recording  he says its a complete fabrication  and that he was in berlin on april 5 not cyprus   he could be telling the truth  he still thinks we killed one of his sons  hes trying to save his family by denying that his countrys behind the nuke  i agree he has a motive to lie but if theres any possibility hes telling the truth   i think we need to investigate  but hes not   i mean its obvious  its not obvious to me  the evidence versus the word of an attempted mass murderer its clear which wins   carrie  and no offence michelle  but your experience as an interrogator is limited   thats enough  i sat three feet away from him  and i believe he is a broken man without the strength or resolve to lie  ill tell the president what ali said when i call him to pass on agent gibsons findings  now if we dont have anything else here i think were finished right thank you  ctu managed to detonate the bomb within a few metres of the coordinates  im going over the field report now im not seeing any casualty estimates  we expect zero direct casualties or close to it  hmm  i want to give bauers daughter personal condolences  you wont have to sir  bauer wasnt on the plane at the time the bomb was detonated   do we know how this happened  another man ended up piloting the plane  were still getting the details  sir we just got word from ctu  they finished their analysis of the cyprus audio  its real and we have proof that syed ali the man behind the bomb  was given support from the three different countries  heres the transcript of their analysis  including margins of error  do we have any reason to doubt the veracity of this  ali is denying it but i suppose thats to be expected   are the joint chiefs ready  general bowden has them on standby  given the evidence we dont have the option of not responding  i dont see any way around this do you  i want to issue a statement that there was a nuclear weapon  but there were no casualties  i will alert the networks sir  and contact the hill  let them know ill be calling for an emergency session of congress  during which ill be asking them for a formal declaration of war  chappelle wants to see your report  im ordering more data points i need another 15 minutes  fine   you all right  just a little tired like everyone else  no i mean about before   it got tense between you and carrie  i can handle carrie  you dont have the training or the experience to read a guy like ali   i shouldnt have put you in that position  we should press him   they will in guantanamo  it may be too late  were sending him now im heading over to make sure the handoff goes as planned  ok  general bowden my understanding is itll take between eight and ten weeks  to call up reserve troops and redeploy forces for a fullscale ground assault  we have the resources in place to initiate a rolling start immediately  rolling start  surgical strikes against earlywarning radar and antiaircraft installations  followed immediately by bombing of targets that will degrade  their military and telecommunications capabilities  can these first strikes be underway by the time i address the nation this morning   when are you scheduled to go on the air  six hours from now  well be ready sir  mr president  gentlemen ladies would you hold please  deputy prime minister barghouti is calling  its his second call since the bomb was detonated  were well past the point of words were about to invade his country  but he doesnt know that yet if you dont take his call he may read between the lines   mr deputy prime minister  thank you for taking my call  the prime minister wanted me to express his outrage for what has occurred   thank you  that you found the bomb is truly a miracle  im not sure i believe in miracles sir   my people are good at what they do  indeed they are  im sure youre aware that weve arrested one of your citizens in connection to it   syed ali  an outlaw he has eluded us for years  expect our full cooperation with his punishment  i would expect nothing less  i realise weve had our differences and today has been an especially trying day  but we are both fighting the same battle  my government remains dedicated to the destruction of second wave  as well as any other terrorist organisation that may have been responsible  for this atrocity  thats good to know  i understand you will be under a great deal of political pressure  to respond to what has happened  im confident that you have the strength to resist  dont be concerned about a rush to judgment were merely gathering evidence   i appreciate your candour mr president  and i appreciate your solidarity   of course  youll hear from me soon  come on lets go   hey jack im glad youre ok  thanks  ill get out of your way how can i get ahold of kim  i spoke to a sergeant griggs with the san jose sheriffs department  he sent a man to your sisterinlaws to meet kim thats his

daughter is in any danger let me assist you  no shes not in any immediate danger  listen maam fine just give me the number   same area code 5559464  ok   im glad youre ok jack  thanks  i know tonys running things and i dont want to speak out of turn but   i dont know who to talk to  about what  the presidents planning military action based on a recording from alis apartment  it links officials from three governments to the nuke  the problem is ali claims it was a fake   and you believe him  i dont know  we ought to be sure before we retaliate against them  thats tonys call im trying to get ahold of my daughter  i understand but youre the one who broke ali  you can read him better than anyone here please jack before ali is gone  only he can prove whether the recording is real  fine ill talk to him  see if you can get ahold of this sergeant griggs tell him its regarding my daughter   sheriffs department  this is michelle dessler over at ctu   im looking for sergeant griggs  please hold  there you go  bring him out  i just wanna talk to him before they get him to guantanamo  gentlemen hold up  let me have a word with the prisoner  i want you to know we didnt kill your son we staged it  when you get to guantanamo theyll let you speak with your family  i need to know something the cyprus recording is it fake  what i told the woman was true  thank you  we got shots fired on the north roof  get back here hes dead you got a radio on you  tell them inside syed ali has just been shot  weve got a shooter on one of the southwest roofs tell em now  this is primary escort we have a prisoner down and a sniper on the roof  would you take care of that for me   lapd say the perimeters set up  howd anybody know we were moving him  intelligence knew we had him the leak could have come from anywhere  shooters gotta be connected to a country implicated on the recording   maybe  they had the most to lose by ali talking   who else would it have been  ali might have been telling the truth   you talked to michelle  no i talked to ali   captain raskind from lapd for you  one minute please  youre taking syed alis word over every expert we have  tony ali was killed for a reason  find out if it was cos he could prove the recording was fabricated   our best people have verified it  fine   keep the door open assign men to it  i dont have any men to spare  were processing intel from nine countries and i think this is a dead end   captain raskind wants to know  could you give me a minute  thank you  tony the president is gonna make some very very serious decisions  based on the information that he got from that recording  if its not genuine you have a responsibility  youre gonna lecture me on responsibility  we both know how you work you consider going against the grain some kind of a virtue   why are you talking to me like this  i got a job to do i dont wanna be told how  im just trying to help  i dont need your help jack  dont get me wrong i appreciate everything youve done for us today  but i think its time you go get your daughter let us handle the rest of this  yeah fine   thanks yeah  mr almeida  all circuits are busy please try your call again  some kind of problem  can i just use the bathroom   please ill be quick  all right come on  in the back on your left watch your step  casualty estimates for the initial air campaign are minimal a dozen at most   and the ground campaign  there are numerous scenarios  depending on how long the campaign lasts  if chemical or biological weapons are deployed against our troops  which frankly i think they will be  ok take that all into account then give me a number general  a simultaneous ground assault against the three countries which lasts five weeks  will result in ten to thirty thousand american casualties  and if china and russia enter the conflict against us  theres no upper limit to that number mr president  but its unlikely theyll want to insinuate themselves into control of the oil fields   yes  i have jack bauer its an emergency  one moment sir its jack bauer for you  excuse me again  its good to hear your voice but im in a meeting with the joint chiefs  i felt this was important enough to interrupt you  syed ali has just been assassinated  ctu was transferring him over to guantanamo when it happened   what are you talking about by whom  we dont know yet sir  i think it has to do with the conversation recorded in cyprus  mr president i dont believe its genuine   that recording was authenticated  sir authentication is never 100 per cent  do you have evidence  ali said he was in berlin when the conversation took place   he said the recording was fabricated  ok im aware of his denials  mr president im worried that someone is trying to manipulate you  into taking the kind of military action i assume youre about to take  look the fact that syed ali was killed does not prove that the recording was fabricated  no sir i know that i know it doesnt  but i feel a responsibility to tell you i believe he was assassinated  because he was in fact telling the truth  do you have any hard evidence jack  aside from alis denials no sir nothing concrete  listen to me i dont wanna initiate a military action based on erroneous information   but i cant stop it based on conjecture  i understand sir i do  if i were to get you proof how much time would i have  our military response is only hours away jack   you better do it soon  yes sir thank you mr president  we dont have any updates as soon as we do well patch them through to you   this is dessler  michelle its jack  i want you to keep this information between us ok  i talked to the president he will not halt any military action unless we provide proof  ali was our only proof  theres gotta be another way to establish alis presence at that time  other foreign agencies must have been tracking him   an official from a target country is here  what here at ctu why  we struck an agreement earlier today  hes the one who escorted evidence from alis apartment   think he knows something  he might  tony doesnt want him talking to anyone   ok fine whats his name  yusuf auda auda  ill pull up his cv and run a background check ill get back to you   jack  kate  i didnt think i thought you werent coming back  i didnt think i was either   how  its a long story  but everythings ok right they said the bomb was detonated safely  no everythings fine its gonna be fine  how are you are you ok  yeah my dads still a little shaken up  im sorry   miss warner  i have to go   she needs to be debriefed  ok well see you in a little while   im really glad youre ok  thanks  the joint chiefs are revising down their material estimate between 10 and 20 per cent   thats good news sir  none of this is good news mike  general bowden is ready to walk you through the strategy statement   i need a few more minutes  how long should i tell him  when im ready mike  what is it mr president  the telephone conversation with jack bauer keeps playing in my head  im worried that we may be moving too fast  mr president your ability to analyse a situation is your strongest asset  but its also your greatest liability  i dont wanna make a mistake that our children and their children will pay for  sir we have evidence thats been confirmed  by every military and intelligence expert on the payroll  everyone except jack bauer  its natural for you to be having doubts  id be worried if you werent having doubts  but when the public learns what happened theyll want a decisive response  theyll demand it  were not responding to satisfy bloodlust  no sir were not  were responding because three countries colluded with a terrorist group  to explode a nuclear bomb on our soil   and we have proof  what if the proof is a lie   it isnt  are you sure mike  are you sure  ill tell general bowden youll call when youre ready   mr auda my name is jack bauer  dont give me another excuse  i need to ask you a few questions about the evidence taken from syed alis apartment  how would i know what was found you people refuse to include me ask them  my colleagues might not be interested in the same questions that i am  im trying to determine whether or not the evidence couldve been compromised  before i tell you anything tell me what you know  whatever was found theyre keeping it from me suggesting it incriminates my country  im sorry you and i are not even supposed to be talking  youre asking me to help offering nothing in return   i know im asking a lot  asking too much  this is bauer   hello jack  who is this  the only person who can prove syed ali was not in cyprus in april meeting arab leaders  the recording they found in case you havent figured it out is bogus   how do you know that  because im the one who planted it   on april 5 i placed it in alis apartment  and im supposed to believe you  you dont have a choice thats why i killed ali so youd have to deal with me   how do i know you killed him  i
