 continue  we knew about the bomb weeks ago  thank you simmons  what do you mean knew  we let it in the country  tracked it all the way  we allowed it to sneak through customs  and we allowed the second wave terrorist cell  to operate unimpeded  god roger a nuclear bomb  theres no chance that this bomb is ever gonna go off  there never was  we had a special ops team following it every step of the way  colonel samuels team  the mission was to take the bomb out of play  at the last possible moment  what are you trying to do start a war with the middle east   no  then what  your defence policy is too passive   you need more resources  youre trying to hijack my presidency  no no no id like to give it some balls  youre gonna call your special ops team tell them to secure the bomb now  they went dark three hours ago  not accepting any new incoming communications till the missions complete  and where were they  where were they  norton airfield los angeles  the showers in there youre welcome to use it  try not to stay in there too long theres not a lot of hot water  theres some towels in there and ill try and get you some clean clothes  the door has a lock  thanks  i just got off the phone with division  syed ali named three more second wave terrorists in the la area  i want two transport teams assigned to each one pick em up now  ok  hey guys heads up they just received a second confirmation from nsa in oregon  the location of the bomb is indeed norton airfield  jack bauers en route i want every available field agent over there now   this is bauer  theres a new wrinkle jack   how far are you from the airport  a couple of minutes  what kind of a wrinkle  theres a hostile us paramilitary unit standing between you and the bomb  a coral snake team headed up by colonel ron samuels  its the same unit that took out our plane what is going on  why is a us military unit aiding these terrorists  as far as we know theyre not  the best we can make out they wanna be the ones to secure the bomb  theyll treat anybody who stands in their way as an adversary  order colonel samuels to tell his team to stand down  they went dark three hours ago  theyre a rogue unit acting on their own authority   how do i find them  i wish i could narrow it down  just somewhere at the airport  im trying to get manpower up from camp pendleton  this is bad george  yeah it is our best bet is still you getting past them to the bomb  yes i understand  whats happening  i dont know yet ctu hasnt been able to locate your sister  as soon as they do theyll contact me sorry this is gonna take longer than i thought  omar  dispatch this is 4827  kate  youve seen terrible things today but i need you a little longer in case we find your sister  are you ok with that   agent baker  jack  take miss warner to the secured area make sure shes comfortable  youll need this  thank you  jack bauer steve goodrich im heading up the assault team onsite  i was told you have further intel on the group  these are individual military records of every soldier under samuels command   whats our profile with them  theyre gonna treat us like hostiles   that doesnt make sense  no but thats the situation   is your team ready  inside  we got airport schematics  good everybody gather round  we are going to be engaging hostiles in a large uncontrolled area  i want everyone wearing id tags no exceptions  anybody wants to leave this area check with me first   whos got the schematics  here sir  heres the situation there is a nuclear warhead somewhere onsite  theres an armed delta team surrounding it  i want three subunits unit one makes the first sweep unit two coordinates air tactical  unit three will await my command as soon as ive got a 20 on the bomb understand  yes sir  good luck gentlemen lieutenant set up your teams  gentlemen team a b column of two on me lets go  bauers set up the staging area at the airfield  ok   tony we got a little problem  whats up  brad hammond from division is on his way  they want to shut us down and run everything  were up and running now  not 100 were still having intermittent packet loss  divisions uncomfortable with us running this operation out of a compromised location  we dont have the time to give these idiots the grand tour were closing in on this  theyre on their way so we just gotta deal with it  hey how you feeling   a lot better thank you  have a seat  so why is it that you live up here like this  i dont know i guess i just got sick of the whole la scene  its not like i hate anyone there theres just too many people  dont have that problem up here huh  no its just the opposite  so why dont you move to a small town why do you have to be by yourself  i dont know  so tell me again why you cant go back to la  if i told you you wouldnt believe me so  what  my father works for the government a counterterrorist unit  he said that someones gonna detonate a nuclear bomb in los angeles today  whats so funny  i knew it ive been telling people that this is gonna happen for over a year  no one would listen to me  so you knew about these terrorists  not these ones specifically but yeah  read the foreign papers look over the fence the whole world hates america  i knew it i knew it i knew it  dont worry were far enough away we wont get hurt  no ones far enough away what about the fallout  no one can predict where the winds gonna take it  im gonna show you something but you cant tell anyone  what is it  after we eat  where are we on locating the coral snake commandos  bauer and his teams are looking for them   ctu is updating us every ten minutes  good  this cannot possibly have a good outcome  weve got two highly trained american military groups about to face off  ctu has a formable presence  if the commandos are there ctu should be able to control the situation   mr president weve got something new  what  our com team discovered a covert link between stanton and bruce gluck   the michigan senator  yes  it looks like they were working together how would you like to proceed  sherry knows gluck and his key staffers  they worked closely together during the primaries bring her in  here into the oc  yes shell need access to our secure databases   sir i feel i must  i dont wanna argue about this  just do it  whys it taking so long to get this number  barely anything here theres something   we need this randy come on  im on it  theyre sending division to do an evaluation why are they doing this now  were operational getting results why dont they leave us alone  they will this is just chapelles way of doing stuff over there  what about george  when they get a look at the shape hes in theyre probably gonna yank him  im keeping an eye on him all right just get everyone to norton  what have we got  militaryissue combat boots five sets all leading in here less than an hour old   anything coming out  still in there  have your team ready to move on my signal  its definitely colonel samuels men  if these guys are dead whos tracking the bomb  this is baker copy that were moving into position now  this bank was knocked out but we didnt lose any data  the same data is mirrored at division  we dont need to risk running these operations from a juryrigged system  you cant run a mission on data alone  my team has more experience implementing than anyone at division  i dont think thats true but the point is moot  start to ship some of your people to our offices  and waste an hour on transporting and set up with a nuclear bomb ticking away  i was wondering if this place had a director   brad good to see you  george  i heard youre not feeling well  i imagine youve heard all kinds of things today  but a bad day for me is better than a good day for anybody on your side of the freeway   that right  were not shutting down  we got way too many active protocols in play here  your systems failed their checks this morning  this morning everythings fine now  eileen show brad here how our systems are exceeding all of their time horizons  yes sir  think you can do that at division  dont believe everything you hear brad thank you   come on  what is it  youll see   im not sure lonnie  come on dont be scared  come on  watch your head over here  its a bomb shelter  short of a direct hit you could survive down here for a pretty long time   you did all this yourself  it took me two years  after i dug it out it wasnt too bad  hey check it out im kind of a coffee junkie  i could pretty much handle anything but i gotta have my java  these beans are from argentina here smell this  wow   thats great  the best  mm thats my favourite smell  hey hey  hey where are you going  kim  whats wrong  i just got a little claustrophobic down there thats all  youre shaking are you ok   i dont

need anything   you want me to run everything by you  im familiar with the internal politics   id be able  youll be able to do what lynne  im trying to maintain some form of protocol  no youre trying to position yourself  between me and davids inner circle because you dont trust me  instead of talking about protocols just say whats on your mind you dont want me here   mrs palmer  no you dont me

sherry im sorry  i didnt mean to sound rude i really do appreciate what youre doing  thats why youre here  mr president   yes mike  i just got off with ctu los angeles  jack bauer found the coral snake commandos   so its over  im afraid not  all six members of the team had been killed before bauer got there  what about the bomb  roger your men are all dead and theres no sign of the bomb  thats not possible  your insane plan backfired  those men were our last chance to find the bomb and now theyre dead  my god  youre misguided but you are not crazy you do not want this bomb to go off  of course not  then tell me who else could have known about this  no one they were on their own  somebody killed six highly trained commandos  thats not the work of a bunch of suicide bombers   six commandos  thats right  there were seven   whats the word at the airport  theres too many places it could be  got it its either n34g5 or its n34g6   michelle  im on it  n34g5 its registered in california and its at norton airport hangar md7  get bauer  down the runway to here then to these hangars all down here   bauer  its tony  we got a tail number on that plane n as in november three

the configurations   can you disarm it  it doesnt look good  team a this is bauer i want you to start to clear the north runway   i repeat clear the north runway  what do you mean  if we cant diffuse it ive gotta get it as far away from la as possible   yes thats affirmative  roger that  whats happening  timing mechanism they mustve given it an expedite command  when its tampered with the countdown speeds up  hold on hold on hold on  wait a minute dont touch that itll detonate  what just happened  nothing this isnt a bomb its been rigged to look like one   and the radiation reading  probably the box  there was a bomb in here recently but its gone now  the readings picking up some plutonium residue  all teams we do not have the bomb this is a decoy  i repeat we do not have the bomb this is a decoy  we are still looking for the nuclear device  theres no bomb at the airport roger  if theres something that you havent told me that could save lives  tell me now  please roger
