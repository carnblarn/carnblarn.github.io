                mr president the soldiers that attacked us at the crash site they were americans  their commander is a colonel samuels  whoever attacked us had access to our flight plan  the only way they could have gotten that information was from the inside  roger tell me everything you know about colonel ron samuels from fort benning  i dont know anything about him  i just spoke to roger stanton hes hiding something from me im going to arrest him  i wanted to warn you they know about opcom   how  i told them  this way i get him trusting me again  if she would have known anything she would have told us kill her  you dont have to kill me  can you identify any words that they said  salat it means prayer  i want a list of every mosque in a 15mile radius  i dont know what syed ali looks like i need you to identify him for me   start a fire  youre crazy  crazier than going to la where a nuclear bomb might go off any minute  theres been an accident we need an ambulance   somebody hacked in  who else had access to it   marie  i didnt expect you to find anything   hello  marie we have a problem  what is it  basheer and marko are dead omar has the van now   what do you need me to do  they were supposed to pick up the trigger   where is it  at the place where marko worked  in his locker r  j lumber in burbank   is there a combination  no it requires a key  you must do whatever you can to gain access to this locker and bring the trigger to omar  you want me to do this  marie our mission depends on you now im counting on you  ill take care of it   i know you will  ill see you there  marie you should change your appearance  ok  at the mosque all we need you to do is identify syed ali  then well transfer you back to ctu   you ok  yeah  i know how difficult this must be for you  do you  it would really help me out a lot if you could tell me whats going on  im not at liberty to tell you any more than i already have  your people took the liberty of arresting my father  syed ali took the liberty of kidnapping me and killing paul koplin in front of me  i think ive earned the right to know whats going on  we believe syed ali is at the centre of a terrorist attack  thats gonna take place in los angeles today  what kind of terrorist attack  a nuclear bomb  youre the only person we know of thats ever seen him  we need you to identify him for us  the reason why im taking you with me now is because were running out of time   jack bauer  its george  baker should be on site any minute i got a hard perimeter set up around the mosque  ill get back to you as soon as we get there george  jack theres something i gotta talk to you about  the sheriffs department at newhall  were transporting kim and they got into an accident   what kind of accident  dont worry she didnt get hurt  what the hell was she doing with them your people were supposed to pick her up  by the time our guys got to the station theyd already moved her  i guess some local deputy was trying to be a big shot  claiming jurisdiction for a murder charge  where is she now  she ran off after the accident  maybe she was trying to avoid the local police or trying not to get brought back to la  damm it george you told me you would take care of this you gave me your word  please please find my daughter  jack if its any consolation she is outside the projected blast radius  just find her george  what was that about  my daughter   is she involved in this somehow  no  shes in some kind of trouble though  i dont know yet i hope not  yes ill tell him  the consensus at justice is that the evidence against stanton isnt actionable  how much more do they need weve established a direct link  between him and the mercenaries that shot down bauers plane  that connection is still circumstantial  hes been sabotaging our efforts to find the bomb all day  i cannot and i will not allow him to continue heading up nsa  im only saying its going to take time to get a judge to issue a warrant   we dont have time mike  then dont worry about a pretext  take him out of play now and well deal with the legal ramifications tomorrow  sherry was right  my own people working against me  stanton wont be easy to break not in the time we have  we may need to expand the limits of how far youve been willing to go in the past  what are you saying mike  that you do whatever it takes to find out what stanton knows about this bomb  im sorry i cant disturb them right now  david only found out about stanton because of me  and it makes no sense that hes keeping me out of the loop  im not sure what you think i can do about that  why dont you just tell me what hes doing about stanton  he hasnt let me in on it yet so i dont know whats been decided  cant you find out  mrs palmer if the president wanted input from either of us im sure hed let us know  lynne you took credit for my work on davids speech  and that was ok i was fine with that  but right now my only interest is to help david get through this day  i assume thats your priority as well  ill see what i can do   miss warner  she stays with me  were good to go ive got 30 men ready to move on your order   how many people in the mosque  100 to 125 divided into target groups of 10   were not going in not yet  sir  we go in hot and itll give syed ali time to take his own life before kate can identify him   whats the alternative  we wait for the prayer service to end  he comes out kate identifies him then well take him out surgically   fast and alive hes no good to us dead  what if someone spots us first  they phone ali we lose our surprise assuming hes even inside  were working on a weak hunch he might be at some other mosque  were gonna have to take that chance were waiting this out  i could go in see if hes inside  ill wear a hijab hide my face  he wouldnt see me  i dont feel comfortable putting you in that kind of a position  from what youve told me were all in a pretty bad position  if i could help id really like the chance   you really think you can do this  yeah  get me the schematics to the mosque ill look at the floor plan   everythings in place mr president  do it  lets move  whats going on mike  mr stanton by order of the president im placing you under arrest  for conspiracy to commit treason against the united states of america  what the hell are you talking about  hands off  i demand to speak to the president  im sure youll get your chance sir lets go  come in  sir mrs palmers been trying to reach you for the last halfhour  yes i know  shes on line seven waiting right now   i can put her off if youd like  no ill take it   thank you  yes sir   yes sherry what is it  david thank god  i was just wondering what youd decided to do about roger  im having him questioned  has he admitted to ordering jack bauers plane shot down  not yet  then we dont know any more than we did an hour ago  what is your point sherry  my point is i think you should have waited for something more concrete  i dont run my decisions past you sherry not any more  a large part of the intelligence youre basing your decisions on came from me  i think ive earned a seat at the table here  youre not a member of my staff youre not a government employee   and youre not my wife  that was your decision not mine  sherry whatever role youre playing here today is on my terms my timetable  continue doing what youre doing ill speak to you soon  but  we need one person that we can coordinate with not three  yeah we got that sorted out  you have him contact jack bauer hes running point for us  hey  fbi they want a representative at the mosque but theyve got their wires crossed  listen what we were talking about before  yeah im sorry i shouldnt have put you on the spot like that  no actually im glad you did   you are  yeah  theres been something hanging between us since you started here  yeah yeah there has  i made a decision a while ago to try to keep personal and professional stuff separate  but now i  michelle dessler   tell almeida warners getting agitated  ok ill tell him   theres a problem in room seven  bob warner  yeah hes getting violent  get your hands off of me  you cant keep me here

have you prayed with us before  yes  its been a while though ive been away  its jack youre all right  hes in there syed ali hes in there  stantons last call was to virginia  he wasnt on long enough to get a complete number  but we know its a langley prefix  cia  sergeant  sit down  we have it all roger  you reactivated opcom with an eyesonly order  you used it to communicate with colonel samuels as recently as two hours ago  and weve connected samuels directly to the mercenaries that tried to kill jack bauer  i dont know roger it almost seems as if you want this bomb to go off today  but ill tell you this if people die roger youll be executed  and even if we find the bomb in time youll still get life without the possibility of parole  but all i want is to find the bomb in time  thats why i have a deal for you  you tell me everything  i mean everything  and ill bury this  you resign due to health reasons  youll collect your pension  youll retire in a nice house somewhere in the country  youll be given a written grant of immunity  and nobody will ever know anything about this  do we have a deal  i dont know what youre talking about mr president  ive done nothing wrong  i dont know any more about the bomb than you do  i want you to cover these two back exits from the alley  were looking for a middle eastern man late 30s  black shirt silver buttons black pants  miss warner and i will cover the main entrance  as soon as the crowd starts to leave the building shell identify ali  ill inform agent baker he will give the go  no one moves before that happens if you fire your weapon shoot to wound only  were looking at 19 minutes before the service is over  is everybody clear we cannot afford any mistakes here  ok lets go   there you are sir  thank you  control the focus with the centre dial here  what you did for us in the mosque i thought it was really courageous thank you  youre kidding me im still shaking  you did great  the prayer service lets out in 17 minutes   you

green berets sir unit seven out of fort myers 87   ever put your training to use  the gulf sir  anywhere else  there were some other covert ops  under the directorate at the cia  its all right ted im not on a witchhunt here  but i do need you to answer the question  yes sir for the cia  good you understand the gravity of todays situation  of course sir  i guess youve heard that roger stantons no longer functioning as the head of nsa   i heard he was arrested  he was under my authority  what im about to ask you to do falls outside the parameters of your secret service charge  you wont be able to tell anyone about this without my direct consent  are you still with me ted  what would you like me to do sir  extract information from roger stanton  i see  if he resists how far am i permitted to go  whatever you need to do  yes sir  tony richards and maccabee were shot so was reza naiyeer theyre all dead   what  a janitor found their bodies  i just got off the phone with the lapd  are there

shooter  yeah i understand  has kate warner been contacted by anybody in the last halfhour  no shes been with me the entire time  jack  i think you have to treat her as an unknown  for all we know
