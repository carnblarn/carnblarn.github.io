  id like to know what this is  i dont exactly know myself  i dont believe you sherry  but unless they kill me im gonna have the story of the year  i was kidnapped by the leader of the free world  thats not necessarily true ron  there actually has been precedent for this kind of executive action  if youre here to shut me up youre wasting your time  i sensed i was onto something that they locked me in here only confirms it  im coming out of here with a story deal with it  hm   mind if i sit down  of course not  wed like to release you ron  and we will  but we need assurances you wont go public with the rumour you threatened to broadcast  in return for what i get an exclusive with the president on some watereddown story  not a watereddown story something else  you go out there let everyone know that you are not missing  dont say anything about this morning  the president will let you inside of the oc to report firsthand  no journalist has ever been inside there  why did he send

what the hell is going on   how did it go with wieland  hes not gonna play ball  he thinks hes got the upper hand  he knows we have to let him go eventually  whether theres a legal precedent for this or not he has a hell of a story  im so sorry david i thought i could charm him  ok sherry thatll be all  david  why are you treating me like this  its not about you i just have more important things to deal with right now  you know  youve always been able to forgive  always given everyone a second chance but not me  i came here today to tell you that you were right  right to kick me off the campaign  right to file for divorce  wheres all this coming from  a place of honesty of realisation  i was too caught up in the power   and youre not now  of course you know i love it  but now i am aware of what i can and cant handle  so what are you asking for  let me help you  if what i bring to you can be useful  then you can consider it the start of a new confidence  all right but i promise you absolutely nothing in return  ok  all right there are the transaction records on the week of the 23rd  reza made four withdrawals from the companys discretionary account  175000 150000 50000 another 50000   thats almost a half a million dollars  yeah   what did he do with the money  lets see  he wrote a check to syed ali for 475000 in return for consulting services  so what maybe they were doing business  syed alis only business is bankrolling terrorists  what about my father whats his connection to all this  reza convinced ctu your father authorised these transactions  or maybe he just did them on his own im speculating  my father is not involved in terrorism the government made a mistake  we have to find it and clear him  all right lets try and get into his personal calendar  lets see what he did the days the checks were written  fine  ok  heres your fathers schedule for that week   nothing here either  of course not  my father has nothing to do with any of this  i shouldnt have called you this is a waste of time   wait a minute  what  theres a file in his personal directory thats accessed almost daily  it has a resource tab on it which means its a government file   my dad has government clients  whoa   what  its an autodelete program   cant you do something  yeah im trying   this cant be right  what  the data on this volume has a comsat grid  you see these are addresses csg14877   thats an encoded coordinate  i dont know what youre getting at  the only people who have files like these have government security clearance   why would my dad have that  i dont know   why have i been kept waiting here like this  sit down please mr warner   i have some information  sit down  what information do you have  im not supposed to talk to anybody about this

not supposed to talk to anyone about this without clearance  whats your l3 protocol  i was approached about five years ago because of my international investment work  they asked me if id like to help my country and i said ok  what do you do  my corporation is used as a conduit  to pass information back and forth   to whom  i dont know  that is the truth  now you listen to me mr almeida  i am not an enemy of this country  i am a patriot i love my country  i dont know any syed ali nor why there is a record of me doing business with him  well  if thats true then you have nothing to worry about do you  but there is a connection between your company and syed ali  and im gonna find out what it is  so in the meantime sit tight im gonna check this out   kimberly bauer  yes we need to talk to

youll feel better  hey  were gonna survive this day  all right  come on get changed come on  mr president  these are the updated guidelines stanton sent to local law enforcement and the fbi   i understand sherry ran into stanton  i didnt hear that  has he said anything to you about her being here   i dont think hes very happy about it  do you have a problem with her   i know you think shes useful to you  thats not what i asked  i welcome help wherever we can get it if you feel she performs a function here   sir you better come out here  what is it mike  ive confirmed that there is an imminent threat to national security and public safety  while i cannot confirm the target or nature of the attack  it may come from middle eastern terrorists but terrorists in the us may also be involved  how did he get out  what i find troubling about this story is our president knows about this threat  and isnt saying anything to the public   who was controlling that room  armus  i want to see him now  it doesnt make sense if my father really does work for the government  which is impossible to believe wouldnt he know if reza did something illegal  id think so especially if terrorism was involved  if he knew about reza what does that mean  my guess is your father was aware that reza was involved in some kind of illegal activity   he was monitoring him for some reason  but that doesnt make sense either  my father would not let someone he was investigating marry marie  he got upset if anyone made any critical remark about reza   he treated him like a son  i know agent almeida at ctu pretty well  ill give him a call and see if we could find out  go go  the sunday before you killed my wife  teri and i went down to the boardwalk in venice  just watching all the rollerbladers and musicians laughing at the crazy people  just spending time together  and teri sees this snowcone stand  she giggles like a kid  she takes off running and she wants to get in line she wants one  i remember i was watching her  i couldnt help myself  she was talking with an old lady in line behind her the two of them were laughing  i remember thinking to myself how the hell does she do that  how does she strike up a conversation with an absolute stranger  and they just started laughing like theyd been friends forever  thats a gift  i remember thinking god i wish i could do that but i cant  that was teri  my wife  thats what you took from this world  thats what you took from me and my daughter  i just wanted you to know that  we got a man down
