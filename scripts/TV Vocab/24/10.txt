my brother and l are very disappointed   we had some bad luck thats all  bad luck or bad management   we have every reason to void the contract  theres no need for that  to have jack bauer and david palmer in the same city on the same day  and let them slip through our fingers would be intolerable  dont worry palmer will be dead by the end of the day just as we agreed  how  we still have bauers family as leverage  well find bauer and use him just like we did before  lf plan a doesnt work you should have a plan b not plan a recycled  like l said we still have his family  lf we sit tight theres a good chance bauer will find us  then well make him the scapegoat just as before  my brother wants me to assess the situation personally  l land in half an hour   lll join you by 1030  suit yourself  lf l dont see a substantial improvement in things in the next hour  lm going to ask mr cofell to empty the accounts  you will get zero   mr drazen  lra  you may be in this for the money but for my family its personal   l realise that  then realise this  lf things continue to go wrong the money isnt all youll lose do you understand   this is sherry palmer  hello  lm sure youre as surprised as l am that lm calling you  lm surprised you waited this long l assume youre calling because david still plans  to make the announcement about keith and you cant stop him  so nowyou want me to stop him  youve lost whatever influence you once had with david  so lm sure thats gonna be a problem but you might be able to stop maureen kingsley   how  l dont know  lm sure she has a weakness somewhere  look carl you dont need to ask me for any advice on stufflike this  as a matter of fact lm already taking care of the evidence against keith  taking care of it how  thats allyou really need to know   lm not sure lm understanding you  you dont have to  but sherry if we give david a way out of this make sure he takes it   got it  send it to me  there was a wire transfer to lra gaines at 210am from a swiss account   one million dollars  what does cofell have to do with this   l dont know maybe it was his money  makes sense cofells in finance  phone rings   yeah its jack  nina looks like we have the right cofell  good what have you got on him  he was born in philadelphia went to colgate  mba from ucla in 88 worked in investment banking  started his own firm about five years ago

business school lm in town l hoped we could get together  as soon as hes out of the meeting hes going out of town  thats too bad how much longer will he be in his office  he plans to leave by ten wouldyou like to leave your name  phone beeps  hello  nina tell milo to be ready in case teri calls back  look nina division gave me a headsup  theyre sending in a provisional replacement for jack  they didnt waste any time did they  who is it  alberta green didnt she work for you when you were over at division   yes she did whens she coming  scheduled to arrive at 945  phone rings  ok   ctu

be a later   kim  please mom  l wanna know  l think your father is the best man that lve ever known  but he can be difficult  and his job doesnt help  you remember a couple of years ago when he went away for a few weeks  uh  for some training thing  thats what he told us but lm sure it was a mission  he wouldnt say and maybe he probably couldnt  anyway when he came back he was different  he was distant and preoccupied  and other times he was just angry  he did everything he could to keep it from you  but things between us werent so great  l suppose l could have been more patient  so we decided to try being apart  but it didnt work  no  good  l just want us to be together again  cofells taking a private plane and we got a copy of his flight plan from the faa   hes going to denver  what does that tell us  were not sure were checking people in the denver area  who have known terrorist connections  so far we havent got much   hello nina  hello alberta   nice to see you you know why lm here  yes  gather everyone around will you  ok could everyone stop what theyre doing for a moment l have something to tell you  ld like to introduce you to alberta green  jack bauers been relieved of his duties here indefinitely  ln the meantime albertas been appointed acting director of ctu  good morning  things have been out of control here today starting now theyre back in control  most of you know that an attempt was made on senator palmer at about 8am  you may not know that jack bauer was apparently involved in that attempt  the nature of his involvement isnt clear  but he has escaped custody and is considered a fugitive  we therefore have two objectives find jack bauer  and make a quick and accurate assessment of the threat if any facing senator palmer  l know most of you have been up more than 24 hours  too bad nobody so much as yawns until we accomplish our objective  lf anybody has a problem with that now would be a good time to resign  good lets get back to work  specific assignments will be confirmed or revised within the hour  obviously this is awkward but well get through this were pros   of course  well talk later  phone rings  hold on a minute   boy ls it
