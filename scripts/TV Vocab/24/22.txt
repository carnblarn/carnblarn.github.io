embarrassment for them  lf they do a trade its an admission that hes alive  that the dods kept him here secretly and that on top of that they let him escape  so theyre just gonna sacrifice jack  hes like all the rest of us  expendable  ls that what you think  lt doesnt matter what l think l dont think he walks on water the way you do  but l dont wanna see him hung out to dry either  nina l tried  george without the trade how are they gonna locate drazen  l guess they wont try theyll let him leave the country and pick him up in europe later  lf we do the trade we know where he is  hey youre preaching to the choir thats what l just said to chapelle  they dont wanna draw attention to the situation  end of story  so thats it we just go back to work and let jack die  what can l say  nothing

know mr mason your entire agency falls under presidential purview  and in nine months l will be in that office  lm not sure if thats meant to tempt or threaten me  lt doesnt matter either way because l dont have the authority to pull the trigger on this  from what lm told that authority is something youd like to have some day  whats that supposed to mean  act on your own prerogative go through with the trade  youll be reprimanded possibly even demoted  so far it sounds great  ln the first month of my term lll instate you in a highlevel position in washington  youll bypass five years of middle management  and if you dont get elected  thats not gonna happen think about it george   transportation has been arranged  problems with lastminute changes   lts going to cost more  how much
