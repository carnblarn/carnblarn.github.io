                talk to me  jack made it clear that the only way to get proof is if ctu stays out of it   we dont know if hes alive  hes on an open channel  you cant trace it but you can talk to him   michelle  no jack its tony  the president asked me for proof that the cyprus recording was fake  the man who can provide proof will only deal with me  how do we know hes not using you  ten commandos tried to kill him to stop him making a deal with me  jack   im not gonna make it  just tell me where the evidence is now  its on a memory chip  the source recordings prove the cyprus audio is a fake  wheres the memory chip  inside  come on wallace inside where  doctor  hes dead  we got the chip  our planes are over the atlantic  they will be reaching their targets in three hours  the secretary of defence wants to know how much longer  youll give jack bauer to disprove that tape  jack bauer has up until the time the planes start releasing bombs  from the secretarys point of view thats tying the dods hands  were gonna utilise every moment we have   hes not gonna like that  thats his problem  in order to exploit the advantages of a surprise attack  weve launched 12 bomb squadrons from three stateside bases  but initial air strikes will be launched from our bases in the region here here and here  your request was for air strikes to begin before your address to the nation  i know what i asked for  that came out wrong  you have done a remarkable job mobilising our forces on such short notice  thank you sir  mr president is it fair to assume that youre still behind the attack  cos im sensing some equivocation  i told the vice president but i havent shared this with the rest of you  jack bauer the ctu agent most responsible for finding the nuclear bomb  believes the cyprus audio is fabricated   bauer has no hard evidence  not at this point  this battle plan requires our surprising the enemy with a strike of overwhelming force  we will lose that advantage if we wait any longer  the target countries will mobilise their defences  and our casualties will increase over the long term   by how much  up to 20000 troops  then we have no choice  but to proceed with the plan as stated  what i have to say to the president will have a direct impact on the meeting that hes in   he cant be disturbed at this time  fine just make sure he knows i called  hes in a meeting with the joint chiefs they wont interrupt until its finished  come on   almeida  its jack   where are you  i can barely hear you its a bad connection   i want you to bring wallace back here now  wallace is dead  but i got the evidence its a memory chip containing the original source recordings   how do you know its real  he died trying to give it to me  he had it surgically implanted i hardly think hed have done that if it wasnt authentic   where are you  in north hollywood 40 minutes from ctu   well bring you the chip  call in your route ill send an aerial escort  i need you to get in touch with the president hes in a meeting with the joint chiefs  not until i confirm what youre holding is real  jack come here  youve got to at least tell him whats going on   i need you here jack  tony can you hear me   i hear you jack  i gotta go please just do what i ask   what  we cant go anywhere with this chip   look at this embedded in the silicon  what is it  a transponder it acts like a tracking device   are you sure  yeah  our group uses circuits like this to track sensitive material  i dont understand  whoever wallace stole the chip from tracked him to the warehouse   theyll find us if i dont disconnect it  can you avoid destroying the audio file   i think so  good  danny you have to stop doing this i told you not to call  im sorry youre upset but i dont have time for this right now  why whats going on  nothing dont worry were taking care of things here  really what am i supposed to do   sit tight ill call you when i get a chance  forget it  hey  somethings wrong with the phones  the networks been overloaded since news of the bomb broke   who were you talking to  no one whats going on  jack just called he says hes got the evidence from wallace   does the president know  we havent confirmed its authentic yet  the presidents acting on the assumption that the recording is real  and this evidence may prove that its not i know  tony youve gotta call the president  im thinking about it  this is too big i need something with a finer point  what about this will that work  yeah good   how much longer do you need  a minute or two   one or two  one if you stop bothering me  those people who want their chip back are here  will the tracker still function   the signal should still transmit  i think i can lure them away from here   you and kate get the chip over to ctu  us  dont worry this is gonna work  kate move here against the wall   got it  bring it here  still locked on target  this way  ok i want you to meet me at moorpark and vineland a few blocks west of here  if im not there in 15 minutes leave without me but you get that chip to tony almeida   be careful  ill be ok  signals dropping off   wait hes moving  where  just ahead toward the east entrance  ill catch up  i waited till the meeting broke to tell you the governor called from sacramento   whats going on  people are hitting the streets  he wants you to dispatch the national guard like you did in marietta  mr president tony almeida is holding for you on the emergency satcom network  why on satcom  since news of the bomb got out network circuits have been overloaded  went down a few minutes ago   i can talk to almeida if you want  put him on speaker  mr almeida this is president palmer  youre also on with mike novick and lynne kresge  jack bauer just called with some new information  im a little conflicted about contacting you with this  he has evidence that proves the cyprus recording is counterfeit   what kind of evidence  source recordings of each of the men   they were then reedited  have these been authenticated   not yet were getting em soon  how soon  within the hour sir  mr almeida your confidence in jack bauer is curious  an hour ago you told me he assaulted ctu personnel  and took illegal custody of a witness   he had no choice under the circumstances  i dont follow  the man with the evidence would not have turned it over had jack involved ctu  so what makes you so sure that this is any more real than the cyprus recording  thats just it sir im not   but jack bauer is  yes sir  thank you for your candour ill take this information under advisement  thank you mr president  im calling off the attack  sir before you do that we should talk through the consequences  weve talked enough mike  i appreciate your respect for jack bauer i do but you know the mans reputation  i know the man  then start thinking about your own reputation  meaning  a nuclear bomb was detonated on us soil  weve been shown proof connecting the weapon to three nations in the middle east  proof that may be false  unless you respond decisively  your enemies will exploit that as a failure of leadership as a sign of personal weakness  so what are you saying mike  that i should continue with a military operation just to prove that im decisive   what if jack bauers right  what if hes wrong  sir we have all heard the pentagons assessment  stopping and restarting military action could cost tens of thousands of american lives  an acceptable risk if the alternative is waging war against three innocent countries  mr president we know from past experience these countries arent innocent  im urging you in the strongest possible terms to reconsider  ive made up my mind now get general gratz back in here  conference in the joint chiefs  they look fine send them to district  excuse me  hey look  i just wanted you to know that i told the president about jack   you did  yeah  if jack has what he says he has the president should know about it  how did he react  he wants us to keep him apprised of the situation  you did the right thing tony  well find out when jack gets here with that chip   when did he say  about 20 minutes  when he does get here make sure that thing is real  ill pull up the cpb software right now  all right thanks  tony  yeah  thank you  yeah  all circuits are busy please try your call again   still no signal  i have signal   i just cant get through  maybe its from ctus end  im sure theyre very busy gearing up for the war against my country  there wont be a war yusuf theyll get the chip   theyre gonna know the truth  assuming they want the truth  they dont want war  you sure about that  you might feel differently if it was your family being threatened   vineland and moorpark right  yeah  ill keep an eye out for jack   hes in the northeast quadrant  moving   just stopped  davis where are you  sweeping north along the east wall  hes inside the northeast corner pin him down  yes sir   do not kill him until i have that chip  understood  he took the tracker off the chip  ronnie hes running north toward magnolia come on lets go  all right lets get him back inside  is the president dedicated to this action  general this was not a decision he made lightly   i havent been briefed on this  the president will explain his decision  until he does you should brief your own staff   all right ill take care of it  thank you for your patience   more blowback  and then some  mike have you heard anything about this meeting that the vice president called  a meeting  apparently hes asked cabinet members to be on hand an hour and a half from now   whats the agenda  i dont know because i wasnt invited   who told you about this meeting  someone on gendlers staff  he doesnt know anything more than what im telling you  is it something to do with the president calling off the military strikes  mike what else could it be   did you tell the president about this  no not until i find out more   for all i know it could just be a rumour  thats probably all it is   ill ask around anyway  keep me posted if you hear anything   ohara  wheres stark  right here  get him up yes  ronnie you got the chip  im with the agent who took it off wallace   it was jack bauer wasnt it  yes sir  weve scanned his clothing and induced vomiting to check his stomach  its a waste of time hes not gonna have it on him let me talk to him  yes sir  youre on with bauer  jack youre a hero here congratulations  let me tell you what i wanna do  the world doesnt have to know anything about the arrangement were about to make   well keep it private  who am i talking to  give me a break look i need the chip so lets not be pigs here all right  you tell ronnie where it is  i authorise a very large sum large enough to compensate you for any guilt you might feel  its not for sale  if someone wants to buy it it is  how can you justify starting a war just to profit from the outcome  were just controlling the chaos thats all  no youre causing it  lets not waste each others time trying to bridge our differences ok  theres only one thing we need to agree on a price  i already gave you my answer  when ronnies finished youll give me another  no my answers final  ronnie  i think he wants to talk to you  i heard ill get you your answer  this man bauer ive read his file   so have i  you know he wont be easy to break  hell break   i

president becomes acting president  prescott cant do that  mike were talking about a palace coup   jesper isberg  yeah  give us a moment please  before we talk to him i need to know where you stand visvis the presidents decision  are you questioning my loyalty  theres going to be a lot of lobbying among the cabinet i need to know where you stand  i may not agree with the presidents decision but
