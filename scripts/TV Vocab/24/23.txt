couple of assumptions here  the only way to find jack is through drazen  the only way to get to drazen is if alexis takes us there  so we gotta devote all of our resources to finding alexis   yeah but

please dont patronise me  you feel uncomfortable but not because youre ready to be with my husband  you feel uncomfortable because youre doing it with my knowledge and consent  why are you doing this mrs palmer  lts lts important for davids career that l have his full confidence  and l no longer have that  and you want me to get it  yes and report back to me   we both know what its going to  yes we do   and youre ok with that  no l never said l was ok with it  but lm willing to accept it because its necessary  your elevators waiting  just make sure that palmer has an extra layer of security   lts gonna be a little difficult  yes l know  nina got a minute   hold on  this is important  paul were done ok what  the schematics to the detention facility where they were holding victor drazen  theyve been tampered with   who has access to these archives  division and district  can you find out whos had access to these in the last month   yeah  well do it the sooner the better   you think this is a second dirty agent  yeah  what did tony want  he was just telling me why it was so hard to pick up a thread on drazen  listen l need your help teri bauers a basket case   l dont know what you think l can do  youre good with her you calm her down  come on l gotta deal with chapelle dods still trying to pass the buck  all right  shes in the conference room  l know   ls it over did they make the trade  jacks safe hes no longer a hostage  ls he on his way   we dont know where he is  what  he called in to tell us he was ok but he didnt say anything else   why not  drazen wants him to do something else  that doesnt make any sense why would he do anything for that man   l think its to protect kim  what are you talking about  teri the reason that kim isnt back   oh no no no  just listen to me  we think thats where jack is now hes trying to bring kim back  hes not communicating with us to protect her  lm sorry  the task we have given your father is a simple one  and if he does it  will you let me go  we will see   jack l just got your message  senator l need to see you right away   your office said you might be coming  l am coming there   why  l have a message from victor drazen  they also said that drazen has your daughter and you could be a threat  theyve added to my security secret service has been instructed not to let you near me  they do have my daughter but lm not coming there to harm you in any way   what does drazen want you to do  he wants to speak to you at 1045  lts a scrambled phone so that it cant be traced   what does he want to talk about  money lll explain when l get there  just tell your people to let me through  drazens people who are holding your daughter hostage want me dead  youre asking a lot jack  they had my wife and daughter today and l still managed to save your life  lm not coming there to harm you in any way l give you my word sir  hi  anyone see you come up  no l was careful  why dont you sit down  well how much time do we have  dont worry about that  l have something l wanna tell you patty  yes  youre fired  pack up get out  and dont bother to ask me or anyone else on my staff for a reference  prospective employers wont like what l have to say   l dont understand  l know what youre doing  youre working with my wife against me  senator lm sorry l didnt mean to deceive you like this  but your wife insisted and l didnt know what to say   no would have done it  l know l know l should have   lts just that she can be scary sometimes  so can l  obviously l have made a terrible mistake in judgment and if theres anything l can do  l want you out of this hotel in 30 minutes  you gotta take a look at this these six people have accessed the detentionfacility archives  the first five were just doing scheduled backups heres the sixth  george  george is the mole  lts possible he accessed that file four days ago  why would he have done that if he wasnt involved   you gotta call chapelle  no shut down his network access  you cant let anything go in or out  ok l just gotta figure out how lm gonna do it   where were you  downstairs   downstairs  yeah  ln room 907 with patty  what  save your energy sherry no need to act surprised  l fired her  you know your problem david  you think everyones conspiring against you when in fact were just trying to help  by putting another woman in my bed do you realise how sick that is  oh come on we chose a certain life and we chose that a long time ago  lts not about a house in the suburbs and pta meetings  and whether youre willing to accept it or not we serve a higher purpose  you are not qualified to talk about higher purposes   oh lm not  no youre not  we are about to move into the white house  thats right we  you and l  and all the issues all the politics  all the hard work thats gonna help get us there  lm as much a part of that as you  so dont even try to deny it  please sherry dont go there  lm not begrudging a single thing david l dont need the limelight   you sent her to spy on me  thats right and do you wanna know why   yes l do  because you need me to look out for you  and if you cut me out of your inner circle like you threatened earlier today you will fail  ln every way  you need me david   knock on door  what   jack bauer just arrived sir  lll be out in a moment  were not done here   jack  senator  convincing secret service to let you come up to see me was difficult enough   they wont let me out of their sight  thats fine all that matters  is that you talk to victor drazen when he calls listen to his demands and cooperate  how did they get your daughter  senator we dont have much time he could call any second   ok you said this was about money  yes  200 million of his was frozen after he was abducted   and  he wants it  he says you have the clearance to get it back hell give you instructions when he calls  thats why he sent you to get me to release his funds  once he has confirmation of the transfer hell ask me to take action against you   to kill me  yes  of course l would never do you any harm he has my daughter lm trying to buy time  jack l dont have the authority to transfer those funds and drazen knows that   what do you mean  he knows our system that moneys gone  l dont think thats the reason hes calling  phone rings  senator please answer this phone  ok jack lll do what l can lll tell him what he wants to hear   l cant guarantee hell buy it  thank you   this is david palmer  senator palmer  lt must be nice being reunited with your friend jack bauer   what do you want  electronic whine  drazen drazen  he knows you cant get the money senator  no  static on phone  are you all right sir  a detonation of this magnitude had to be military plastique   get a powder residue well try and trace it  yes sir   where is he david  maam this areas not  let her through lts ok calm down   wheres keith and nicole  at the party are you all right   lm fine  oh god  senator  this is jack bauer from ctu the man who saved my life twice today   mrs palmer  the man that put your life in danger   sherry please  radio status report on the senator  dont answer that yet senator we need to talk about this my daughter  tell them you dont know yet  this is ron we dont have a 20 on the senator yet  whats going on  the man that planned this explosion needs to believe that it was a success  wait a minute you mean you want the world to think that david is dead   yes maam  absolutely not  david whats this all about  his daughter is being held hostage  but we cant have people thinking david was assassinated lts preposterous   lf we dont maam my daughter will die  then what do you suggest we do mr bauer  we keep the senator quarantined for a few hours  we leak a story to the press that he was killed in the explosion   youve got to be kidding  lve never been more serious in my life   no its not gonna happen david tell him  this is about the life of an innocent girl  david we cannot keep playing games with the public and expect to keep their trust  senator if were gonna do this we need to do this now  go downstairs bring the children up talk to no one l mean it  l need all the agents that have seen the senator   who is your senior chief of staff  mike novick  bring in mr novick as well  as soon as mr palmers family gets here no one is to enter or exit this area understood  now sherry   lm very sorry  dont worry about it   are you sure this is gonna work  lt has to  hey almeida whats going on with my network access   what do you mean  l cant access archives or palmers itinerary   lll call lts  l dont have time for that are you up   yeah l think so  lets see  yeah here it is  so palmers still going to dallas tomorrow  call secret service and find out what time his plane leaves   divisions got it covered l dont think  hey real simple  call secret service find out what time his plane leaves  and get my network up and running  phone rings   what happened  well he found out hes cut off  and he seems overly interested in what happens to palmer after he leaves la   we should alert chapelle  no not yet  lf we go to chapelle without evidence hell slice us up   what about his access  lm gonna have to restore it  all right but monitor everything and send it to me  put it up on all the monitors  everybody eyes on monitors  tv events are unfolding by the minute in this tragic and stunning development  the hotel has been sealed off only a limited number of authorised personnel are allowed inside  we have heard from a spokesperson from the palmer camp  who has just confirmed that senator david palmer has been killed in an explosion  there is speculation this is related to this mornings assassination attempt  but at this time no one has been arrested  we did it father we did it  ah yes  all right lll take care of the girl then we can leave  do not do anything until we know that jack bauer is dead do nothing  phone rings  sir we just contacted mike novick hes on his way  agent bauer its for you  thank you   yeah  andre youre a very lucky man mr bauer  l was calling to confirm your death but l see youve survived  andre  l have an offer to make you  youve killed senator palmer lm the last person on your list  lll make you a trade me for my daughter  come to port of los angeles  dock 11a  what assurances do l have that youll let her go when l arrive  sadly none but weve decided the sins of the father need not be visited upon her  port of los angeles dock 11a lll be there in 30 minutes  and jack if you bring your colleagues or involve them in any way well know  l understand  l have to go alone   good luck  thank you sir  why are you doing this to us  yeah jack l can tell him but you should really let us help you on this  no l cant not yet  give us a general position so we can be nearby  no lf drazens got someone else working on the inside it could put kim in danger  all right   let me speak to teri  ok  lts jack   jack  how are you holdin up   where are you do you know about kim  yes lm on my way to pick her up shes fine   where is she  l cant say now sweetheart  but l promise you soon shes going to be with you  thank god what do you mean she what about you   lm sorry l meant to say both of us  oh good  l just dont think l can take much more of this l need you both here jack  l know sweetheart look its almost over just hang in there ok  ok   teri  what   l love you  l love you too jack  honey um  theres something l have to tell you   lve been waiting for the right time  what is it  youre gonna be a father  again  what are you saying that youre pregnant  well yes thats generally how it works jack   jack  lm still here  lm sorry it was the last thing l thought you were gonna say  are you all right with this are you happy about this  oh yes  l am  l keep thinking that maybe its the second chance weve been talking about  are you there   yeah lm still here  are you happy about it  yes yes lm happy about it  lm very very happy  good are you sure everythings ok  yeah  sweetheart l promise you everything is gonna be ok  lts just been a really really long day  just get on back here so we can all go home ok  ok  teri l love you so much  l love you too jack  lll see you soon  l had a sister once  she was full of life   like you  she was a photographer and took hundreds of pictures  l used to love looking at them  now l cant do that any more  you know how she died  has anyone told you  your father killed her   my father would never kill innocent people  you wanted to know   l dont believe you  oh he says it was an accident  but when a man goes halfway round the world to set off a bomb  hes responsible for any accidents that result  has your father ever talked about his work  about where he goes on those long trips overseas  of course not   he cant  because hes a criminal  my father is a good man  no  hes not  palmers still alive the suite at his hotel blew up but apparently he got out unscathed   why the reports  l havent been debriefed  but l guess it makes sense as a defensive strategy  palmers safe as long as the hitters think hes dead  this goes no further than the three of us until the publics made aware that he survived   what about the perpetrators  lts unclear  our intel is being refreshed by secret service as we speak  so stay at your stations start rebuilding profiles based on the incoming information  and well have a new plan in place within the hour  have you spoken to jack since the first time he called  not me  lt doesnt matter thisll all be over soon anyway   have you talked to jack  yeah he called but he wont let us help him  lts kind of cold do you mind if l have some coffee  aaargh  shouting in serbian  speaks serbian  andre stop right there kim  dont move  dont be foolish youll drown  speaks serbian  how are we going to do this without the girl  bauer has no choice but to trust us  phone rings  in serbian  oh there you are we just got some new intel from langley   oh good  yeah take a look at this
