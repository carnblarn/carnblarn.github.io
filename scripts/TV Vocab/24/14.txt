down in the waiting room  nina whats happening with jack  hes being questioned   ls he in trouble  that depends  he broke a few laws but he did it to save you and kim so l think theyll understand  lf he doesnt piss em off first  my thoughts exactly  guess you know jack just about as well as l do huh  lm sending someone to your house to pick up some clean clothes  whats gonna happen when we get released from here why cant we just go home  until we know exactly what happened well take every precaution to keep you safe  when do we get to see my dad  l dont know a lot of things have to happen first some people will wanna talk to you  division secret service us cos you see this wasnt a simple crime  this was a terrorist conspiracy and unfortunately you were in the middle of it  but thats over now   nina wait  yeah  l dont know the details about last night  but l understand youre a big part of the reason why were still alive  so thank you  sure  lll be out here   excuse me  yes  nina myers ctu ls that man fbl   yeah hes with me  he was in three ld like to speak with him  sure but he wasnt in three we just got here  stu   who else is here from the bureau  lts just the two of us   are you sure  of course lm sure  the reason l didnt call ctu immediately for backup  l was worried things could get out of control my wife and daughter were in the compound   but you did eventually call  yes yes  the second teri and kim were with me l called alberta green  you did what any loving father would do  unfortunately as you know our procedures dont allow for any deviation from protocol  l cant reinstate you jack  have you heard a thing lve said dyou understand whats happening  senator palmer is still in great danger now that my family are safe l can help you  as of now your case will be put in the hands of the justice department  justice department  yes under the circumstances l had to break the rules of procedure to protect my family  but l never deviated from my assignment to protect palmer and you know that  yes l know that thats what might keep you from going to prison but thats not my call  we dont have time for this l have come in contact with suspects who are still at large  and l guarantee you they have a contingency plan l am a resource l can identify them  you wanna arrest me do that later but let me help palmer get through the rest of this day   lll ask alberta if she wants you  shes been here for four hours ryan  phone rings  chapelle  woman ls nina myers cleared to talk with bauer   yeah  lll patch you through  thats fine  ok were through here lts nina   keep him company  yes sir   hey lts jack  hows it going  theyre handing me over to the justice department   did you explain why you did what you did  yes of course l did  l think alberta greens trying to make a career move hows teri and kim  they seem ok considering what theyve been through  how long will they have to stay there  a couple of hours then theyll be transferred for questioning  nina look l cant thank you enough for being there really l appreciate it   nina  yeah lm here  whats wrong  when walsh said someone in the agency was working against palmer  didyou sense it was more than one person  he didnt say but lve been thinking about this too someone had to recruit jamey  so for now you have to assume that someone else is on the inside maybe not ctu  district division maybe secret service why what are you thinking  l just wanna make sure that teri and kim are safe here  what do you mean at the clinic   yeah  why wouldnt they be  l dont know lm just exhausted and probably getting paranoid   whats going on there  nothing jack dont worry   l will make sure that they are safe here  ok thanks can l talk to them   theyre being examined right now  ok get back to me as soon as they can talk   yeah  ok thank you  any more information on the backup plan to assassinate palmer  the information that came in matched what we got from divisions database   looks like things are falling into place  give me the headlines  three shooters possibly hired to kill palmer in case the breakfast attempt failed  theres jovan myovic entered the country two days ago  mishko suba also from the balkans came in three days ago through florida  and the other one   no name yet  keep looking  lf hes connected with the other two we need to know where he is and what hes doing  lets leave it right there get the equipment in the shed  lll be in to brief you on our exit strategy lets move it out   mr drazen its kevin  yes   we just got to the transfer point  what about gaines   hes dead  l see  listen mr drazen when gaines hired me for this  l told him there were some defects in his plan that could be exploited  not to say l told you so but lm not surprised that any of this happened the way it did   ls there a point to any of this  yes   yes l can fix it for you  lnteresting and how can you do that  lve done this before l know people  when l was working for the dea in florida  l was able to get to a witness that no one else could find  you get what lm saying  l appreciate the offer kevin but as you americans so often say  plan b is already in effect  what does that mean  hello drazen  get away from me  ls there anything left in the truck  go to hell  palmer get me three copies of this report as soon as you can get it  are we saying palmer should stay in for the duration  no no hes gotta get outta california now  the backup shooters are in la and theyre gonna come after him  all right leave that with me let me look it over one more time before l do anything  tony  yeah  are you satisfied with your position here  sure  because l always had the impression you had too much talent to be a number three at ctu  what do you want me to do alberta  see thats what l like about you you get right to the point  before chapelle makes his final evaluation of jack hell wanna talk to you   why me  because you called in the lockdown  lets face it nina is hardly impartial when it comes to jack and chapelle knows that  and you want me to tell him what  the truth that even though jacks family was in danger  there were ways he could have dealt with it without compromising the integrity of ctu  lf jack had confided in you from the beginning  you never would have had to call george mason to lock things down am l right  jack  alberta  chapelle asked me to debrief you personally  fine  l have to tell you this is your turf l feel uncomfortable debriefing you  dont lts quite all right  lts pointless to ask you questions  why dont you tell me what you think l need to know save us some time  l went through the events with chapelle  what you need are the threads and lds so youll know how to proceed tactically   do you mind  no but before we start l need something   whats that  l wanna phone my wife and daughter  they dont know whats going on with me over here l wanna ease their minds  sorry jack l cant do that  so why dont we dispense with the are you all right jack l feel uncomfortable crap  ok you wanna talk straight fine dont handle me  tell me what you know  you need to get ahold of langley have them open up their balkan terrorist database  why the balkans  the people behind the hit on palmer are financed by a ted cofell  he was a banker with family connections in that area of europe  was  he died three hours ago  keep talking  the money that we traced came back to ted cofell lndustries which is based here in la  phone rings   ctu almeida  tony l have a problem  to me as fbl but l know hes lying  how dyou know  cos l met the only two fbl agents assigned here and they knew nothing about him  maybe the right hands not talking to the left  l dont think its that can you send someone over l need to pull some prints off a phone  sure anything else   no thats it just hurry  all right you got it  and the senator wanted to get your approval on these   what are they  the photographs for time magazine  oh right l wanted to see those   these are nice  uhhuh   keith mom  hey um   use that one patty  ok thanks  so whats goin on   l talked to dad  and  and lm a little confused  all night hes been trying to convince me to air this thing about nicoles rape and about  no we dont need to worry about that right now  no thats just it we do have to  l know about dr ferragamo   and l know that fire wasnt an accident  keith   but dad wants to keep it quiet  dont get worked up   l am worked up  hey  look covering up an accident is one thing  but were talkin about murder   lm goin to the police  no   lm sorry lve made up my mind  you will listen to me keith   lt is not your decision to make  l cant believe youre saying this  thats because you dont know what it takes to raise a family to keep it safe   what does this have to do with safe  lt has everything to do with it  nothing is simple in life sometimes you just have to make a decision  that is what we did and you will respect that do you understand me  l understa  have patty pack up your things we have to leave the state  why  theyve done a threat assessment lts too dangerous for us to stay   where are we going  nellis air force base in nevada   have you discussed this with mike  of course  he believes this isnt a call they would make unless the threat was imminent  l thought you said that the man from the breakfast jack bauer was in custody  he is but he may not be working alone  there are others that are after me  so lets go lets get our things together now  come on keith keith   you didnt call it in  my family were in danger so l kept ctu out  phone rings   yeah  woman tony chapelles ready for you  all right thanks   hey tony  sir  have a seat  as you know we have an important decision to make pretty soon about jack bauer  whether or not to pursue criminal and disciplinary charges   l understand  lm not gonna lie to you  this may boil down to your testimony as you seem to be the most impartial observer  let me save you some time mr chapelle  lm not the biggest fan of jack bauer  l dont agree with the way he delegates authority  and l dont like the way he runs operations  but since midnight last night  you wont get me to disapprove of a single action hes taken  fair enough  you talked to nicole  yeah theyre taking care of her theyre gonna meet us at the airport  yeah lll tell him thanks  that was the pentagon  remember after the incident at the breakfast you asked me to check out jack bauer  who is he  he used to be in special forces  led a sixman team into kosovo a couple of years ago  thats what it was  the drazen mission  yeah he handpicked his men and trained them  only bauer survived  he blames me for the loss of his team  thats what this is about  patty can you get this to mrs palmer l didnt have time to pack it   arent you coming with me  no lm taking a later flight  l have an aunt in town l promised my mom ld visit shes in a nursing home  sure  ok we need to get destinations on that one make sure you fax that to the other office   hold the elevator please  sure   elizabeth  l cant stay long  then we shouldnt waste any time  nina anything   nothing  that cant be l saw him holding the phone   those prints have been wiped off  lt doesnt make sense  housekeeping didnt come in here  this wasnt housekeeping theres not a single print anywhere on that phone  lt was done by a professional  yes the weapons would be consistent with that scenario  phone rings  excuse me   green  lts nina  can l move teri and kim bauer to the safe house now  are they done  everything but the debrief but l can do that once were over there   fine do it  thank you  the ultrasound showed the remnants of a small follicular cyst   a cyst  yes lt burst thats what caused the pain  the good news is its the most common type of ovarian cyst and its completely benign   why did it burst  could have been the assault  can also happen when your uterus enlarges when was your last period  last month lts due some time this week  ld like to do a pregnancy test just to rule it out  ok  excuse me teri we need to go now get your things  were not finished here yet   change of plan we need to move  ls something wrong  we

you about l want you to take it as soon as possible  thank you thank you for everything  theyre leaving now  his name was theodore cofell we traced his company to los angeles  from money that had been
