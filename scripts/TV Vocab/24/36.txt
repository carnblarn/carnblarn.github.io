                theres a link between stanton and the mercenaries that shot down bauers plane  stanton wont be easy to break you may need to expand the limits of how far youll go  mr stanton by order of the president im placing you under arrest  this falls outside the parameters of your charge  what would you like me to do sir  i dont know what youre talking about   where is she now  she ran off after the accident  maybe she was trying to avoid the local police or trying not to get brought back to la  just find her george  ow  marie we have a problem basheer and marko are dead   what do you need me to do  they were gonna pick up the trigger   where is it  the place marko worked in his locker  you must gain access to this locker and bring the trigger to omar  ill take care of it  ive earned the right to know whats going on  syed ali is at the centre of a terrorist attack we need you to identify him for us  hes in there syed ali hes in there  damm it  hes dead jack  these clothes dont belong to this man  maintain secure exits ali is still in the building  step outside until we get the situation resolved   agent bauer told me to stay talk to him  as soon as you step outside  she stays with us shes gotta make the final identification on ali  this was in the pocket of the man ali set on fire   it might be a document ali was carrying  photo it send it to ctu  are you trying to protect this man  no i have no misplaced loyalties  if the man has murdered an innocent he is as guilty in the eyes of islam as he is in yours  the man that im looking for set in motion a plan today  to detonate a nuclear weapon in los angeles   are you certain  yes were certain  we estimate between one and two million people will die if this bomb goes off  that sir is why we need to find him now  thank you for informing me but i can be no more honest with you than i have been  but if you find this man perhaps i can talk to him in a way you cannot  persuade him  agent bauer  thank you  we found something i think you should see  we found this trap door its not on any of the schematics you gave us  open it   i go down im going down alone  i know this is your operation  listen to me we just lost one of alis men to a cyanide capsule hidden in his tooth  we have to assume alis willing to take his life the same way he cant see us coming  have your men assemble at the base of the ladder await my instructions  have you got your baton with you let me have it ok   hello  marie   there has been a change of plans  why whats going on  just go to the rendezvous point  if im not there within one halfhour of the time we have planned  then you know what to do   you remember what i said yes  i remember  ive got the suspect engage the room engage the room  get his legs   thats him that is syed ali  get her outta here get her outta here  get her outta here  i got the cyanide get him ready  baker  find out who he was talking to  its hard not to sit here and think that there must be some mistake  even with the evidence you have  its blackandwhite bob your daughter killed reza and two of our agents  and i need you to help us understand what her connection to syed ali is  if id known she was involved i would have done something  and now that you do know does it help explain any strange behaviour  anything you can tell us will help  well  marie went to college in london while i was working there  thats when her mother died and it hit her hard hit us all hard  and  she ran away for a while  how long  three maybe four weeks  we got the police involved but  she sent us a letter saying that she was fine  that she was travelling and she just needed some space  and when she came back  i was so grateful to see her that i stopped asking questions  no sense that anything had changed  any fundamental difference  she had become less politically inclined  marie had always flirted with causes respectable causes  like save the wilderness or abolish the death penalty  she stopped talking about all that  thats precisely what happens when youre radicalised  handlers train you to stop talking about anything keep it to yourself  so youre better able to blend in with the background  marie had handlers  hey can it wait ill be right back with this  this scan came in from the mosque a burnt paper fragment found in alis clothing  the only thing visible is in the lower left quadrant  it looks like a piece of a number a six or an eight  are all our forensics people out in the field  we got murdoch on loan from san diego hes an expert with computer imaging  if anyone can see this he can   how are you doing george mason  hey man randy murdoch   pleased to meet you  good to meet you   any way to accelerate the process  my cpus faster than anything you got  parallel processing could take too long to set up if theres anything there ill get it  great wheres tony and the satellite feed jack wants  in progress   thank you keep it up  all right   who else knew about the bomb  i dont know what youre talking about  jack bauer is interrogating ali as we speak  well be informed of his progress on a minutebyminute basis but nothing yet  were certain he knows the location of the bomb   jack bauer is  make sure he has all the resources he needs  yes sir  the pains only going to get much much worse  you can stop it  agent simmons tells me that roger  received the same training of resisting interrogation he did   im increasing the voltage  but everyone breaks eventually  you have an entry point  she entered the forest somewhere between 83 and 84 on the topo map   and heading  no no idea which way she was headed   keep me posted  what are you doing   getting more men looking for kim  i told you to divert resources to the bomb  the satellite feed is happening i was telling the sheriff to look for her  youre a resource dont split your attention  i promised jack id do everything i could to look for kim just like you did  kim is outside the blast radius the rest of los angeles isnt  stay focused on the bomb tony that goes for everybody   la county ranger station  this is tony almeida at ctu  im trying to track somebody who went into the forest  hold while i transfer you  hey somebody there  hello   who are you what are you doing here  me what are you doing here  i got into a car accident  i started running and before i knew it i was out here i had no idea where i was  i got stuck in this stupid thing  look all i wanna do is get back to the highway and get outta here  why were you running from the highway in the first place  i told you i was scared and panicked  damm it  oh god thank you  coming through here  were moving into position now baker out  i know who you are i know everything that youve done  where is the bomb  wheres the bomb  you are wasting my time  when is the bomb gonna detonate  youre the one wasting time  i woke up today knowing i will die  i can make you die with more pain than you ever imagined  then i will have that much more pleasure in paradise  right  we gotta figure out how to get you to the nearest ranger station  no thats ok i dont wanna go back there  the same reason you ran from the highway  here i got it thank you  the highway is a couple of miles that way  but the terrains too rough to follow at night and theres cougars up in that area  my place is a halfmile that way  i could put a roof over your head for the night  i am the imam of this mosque  do you deny these mens accusations  that you are planning to explode a bomb that will kill millions of people  the koran clearly forbids the killing of innocents and noncombatants  you know this as well as i do  we have different interpretations of the koran  you are misguided  someone has twisted the words of the prophet  allah does not love aggressors  listen to me the murder of one innocent let alone millions will not get you into paradise  we will continue this debate when i see you there imam al fulani  i want the images from this computer transferred to these monitors  i have talked to men who misuse our religion to channel their hate  but i have not known anyone who would act on their impulses  can you make an appeal thatll make any difference   i will try again but i dont think so  we dont have that kind of time  please i want to try again  you cant be involved with whats gonna happen next  please escort the gentleman upstairs   agent bauer  yeah  we recovered the last number ali dialled on his cell its a 310 area code 5552130   were doing a workup on it now  ok good  wait what was that number   no thats not possible thats my sisters cellphone number  whats going on what are you not telling me  why dont you give us a minute  reza and two of our agents were found shot to death  in your fathers building about an hour and a half ago   what  your sister marie was with them   marie is she ok  they dont know where she is right now  when were you going to tell me  when we had confirmation that she was the person that pulled the trigger  what that is ridiculous how could you even think that  because we have video tape on her  she was the only person seen leaving your fathers building in the last hour and a half  she was probably trying to escape she could have been hurt  you dont know if she picked up the phone could have been stolen  you really believe your sister has nothing to do with this  yes i really believe it  theres one way you could prove that to me phone her cellphone  but if she picks up you have to keep her on the phone so we can find her  thats the deal can you do that  ok  ok  ok  im gonna be right back  baker  we need to trace a cellphone call but manipulate the caller id  we need to make it look like its coming from kate warners phone get on it now  our equipment will make it look like youre calling from your cellphone  tell her youre worried cos you havent heard from her  were linked into the cellprovider network  once we lock we can track the phone  ok good lets make the call  what if its not her what if its someone else  thats what we need to find out  finding your sister right now could save the lives of millions of people  please make the call  hello  hi  its me  i havent been able to reach dad hes not back yet  whats going on  just taking a drive to clear my head  i can understand  im so sorry marie about everything  yes  do you want to meet back at the house grab a bite  can you  theyve found reza havent they they know whats happened  i dont know i dont know what happened  oh marie  tell me please what happened  you wouldnt understand kate  you killed reza and those agents  people have to die for things to change  were locked  you couldnt have done this they forced you you didnt know what you were doing  we tracked it to a tenblock section of sylmar  tell chp to shut down that tenblock radius  send vitals on marie warner   tell them to find her  got it  you dont know who she was with  they could have been forcing her you dont know  im sorry im sorry   any word back from the ranger station  nothing yet they mounted a search  tony i just sent this to jack over at the mosque check it out  this paper has a very irregular pulp pattern  the final step in the process is to take samples from various points  to create a cgi algorithm of what the paper looked like  without any of the writings or other impressions on it  we then subtract that from what weve actually got and what we get  is a representation of anything that interrupts that pattern  there it is ok this is only a partial  there are a few more markings letters or numbers to the right of these  but i need time theyre more obscure  do we have any contacts whatsoever as to what these numbers and letters refer to  they photographed the paper on both sides thats the only area with any information  all right good job  michelle get anyone we can spare on that sequence of letters and numbers  check vin numbers licence plates  also get crypto to see if thats a code  im on it   agent bauer  yeah  this just came in from ctu  open the door open the door  n34 what does that mean  what does that mean  you screwed up ali  were gonna crossreference that number in our database  marie warner is being picked up as we speak  the pieces are starting to come together no matter what well find this bomb  so you can either tell me now or i can make you suffer  you wanna suffer  i already told you im not afraid to die  the only way youre gonna die today is if i kill you your bombs not going off   we have a live feed  patch it through  go  those men will kill your family if you dont tell me where the bomb is now  i despise you for making me do this  theyre waiting for my order  this is your last chance wheres the bomb  sir  are you aware jack bauers threatening the lives of syed alis family  no   where is the family  in their own country  ctus been in contact with the security forces there who have alis family in custody  we just got word that jack has requested they kill the family one by one  till ali tells us the location of the bomb   would the security forces do this  they do act against civilians  and their government is afraid of retaliation if a bomb does go off yes i think they would  can we let this happen condone the murder of innocent people  the bomb is an act of war and wars result in civilian casualties  i dont want a rationale here mike  i dont know of a war where a president targeted children  compare this to a weapons factory near a hospital  a situation we have faced  a bombing would still be ordered on the logic that many more people will be saved  by the destruction of the factory  the numbers are even more compelling here  a few people may have to die to save millions  how could it have come to this  your wifes been writing you letters every day  she doesnt know where to send them  your son asad wants to grow up and be just like you  turns 12 next week  i dont think hes gonna make it  i know what its like to lose someone to watch them get killed right in front of you  i dont wanna hurt your family  but i will order those men to pull that trigger if you dont give me the information i need  i am  i am doing allahs work  no youre going to kill millions of people thats what youre doing  agent bauer  its important its the president  this is jack bauer  cant let you do this jack  sir ali was willing to take his own life to complete his mission  his only vulnerability is his family  it is not the policy of this country to kill innocent children  the action would take place in his country  you would not be involved this would be a field decision  my decision is final im sorry jack  yes sir  i understand mr president  no i do not think that there is another alternative  i know its a difficult decision sir  yes sir  thank you for your support mr president  he authorised the action   roger stanton isnt available  when can i talk to him  thats all i can say rich  if you have a tactical question talk to scott grant hes got the nsa playbook   i can use your name  sure  mike can i just have a quick word with you please  yeah sure lynne  i dont trust sherry palmer she shouldnt be here  im up to my eyeballs trying to hide this interrogation with stanton from washington  if you have a problem deal with it yourself  i think you know me well enough to know this is not some battle over turf   this is about roger stanton  what  i was waiting for the appropriate time to tell you i wanted to be sure  someone has approached me with evidence of communications  between roger stanton and sherry palmer  and it has been over the last six months  roger said he met her today for the first time  yes i know  my god  youve known sherry for a very long time is today indicative of how she operates  then this shouldnt be too much of a shock to you  sherry palmers a lot of things but a traitor to this country  i dont believe that what kind of communication phone calls  yes phone calls emails mike  face to face  whos your source on this  its been through an intermediary  but i actually have a meeting with the source in about ten minutes   where  off site   are you telling the president  no hes got enough on his plate already  and hed want proof anyway you go ahead with your meeting  let me know what happens   be careful  i will thank you   shall we proceed as planned  affirmative start with the older son asad  if thats not successful move on to his younger son   copy that waiting for your orders  we are a go  i cant wait any longer tell me where the bomb is or i will kill asad  ali i know you think what youre doing is right but its my job to not let it happen  please dont make me do this asad is just a boy tell me where the bomb is  tell me where the bomb is fine  kill him  no no  tell me where the bomb is   tell me and ill spare your family  i will not tell you  your meetings changed now its with me  no dont go anywhere lynne we need to talk   i dont think so  yes we do  you think youve connected me to roger thats exactly what they want you to think   who is they  the people rogers conspiring with  so youre confirming that roger stanton is involved he knew about this bomb  rogers more involved than david could possibly know  what the hell does that mean   this conspiracy what is its goal then  to take over the presidency  these people are feeding you misinformation about me  because theyre afraid ill get in the way  how did you know about this meeting  i dont have to be involved to know the moves  if you knew what roger was doing why havent you said anything  probably for the same reasons youre keeping this line of inquiry to yourself  i want to have as much concrete evidence as possible  sherry you could have said any of this to me back at the retreat why come here  to make a point thats all  to make a point  i think this is a warning  i think you orchestrated all of this to show me how powerful you are  you have your own and not the presidents best interest at heart  i will do everything to make sure you dont hurt him or undermine this administration  asad is dead theres nothing i can do to change that  you can still save fareeds life  ill give you ten seconds wheres the bomb  youre running out of time i will tell these men to kill your last son  where is the bomb  thats it take him out   i will tell you  hold it   i will tell you  tell me now   it is at norton airfield  why whats the plan  we were going to fly over downtown and detonate it  it is true it is it is true   dessler  its jack get me mason  its jack  what do you have  the bombs at norton airfield theyre planning to fly it over the city  nortons a mediumsize airfield they do cargo private aviation  every planes tail number begins with the letter n thats probably what this refers to  ok were on our way  were moving units bravo echo and lima to norton airfield  where we believe that the bomb is located  call faa and have them ground flights in or out of norton  if they do get the plane in the air we wanna have two f16s at the ready to intercept  well get bomb units and swat teams over there as well so just move  and remember the no unnecessary contact rule remains in place  put miss warner against the wall  you killed my boy you killed my boy you killed my boy  i will get you for this you will die for this  how could you youre worse than they are  reroute the satellite back to normal feed i want confirmation  rerouted satellite you should have live picture now  thank you  hold this for me  were gonna come in from the north  set up our men coming in from the south from these two gates  hes alive  it was all an act  kate come with me help me talk to your sister  what where  norton airfield its where the bombs located   do you really think shes there  yes i do   please kate we dont have much time  ok  come on  here you go sir  wake up stay with me mr stanton wake up  there we go who else knew about the bomb mr stanton
