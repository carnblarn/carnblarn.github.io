                there are cabinet members who question whether youre fit  to continue as chief executive of this country  we are invoking the 25th amendment  i intend to show your erratic and irrational behaviour since the start of this crisis  you see the results the vote is against you  please remove yourself from the decisionmaking process  i swear that i will faithfully execute the office of the president of the united states  so help me god  i got a message that the president called off the military offensive   is it true  yes   you knew about it  i did  why keep my people processing intel on a scrapped operation  theres a strong possibility the white house will reinstate the attack   dad  sweetheart   ive been trying to reach you  are you at the sheriffs station  theyre taking me to the mathesons house to pack up my things glad youre ok  me too   have you got the audio file  no  are you saying theres no audio file on that chip  if there were they were destroyed  michelle traced the sequence to a hacker named alex hewitt   he created the cyprus audio file  yes  im checking up on a man who engineered the recording  are you convinced that the cyprus recording is forged  yes sir without a doubt  alex   hewitts not here  im not surprised  check the garage see if his cars still here  even with the delay we predict we have not lost the element of surprise  as you can see here sir the primary targets are still relatively unguarded  resistance should be insignificant   when were these pictures taken  ten minutes ago sir  then we can proceed with the attack as planned  yes mr president  i need your key codes sir  how much longer will prescott detain me  until after the press conference  in a couple of hours hes going to announce the us response to the bomb  and his ascension to the office  your key codes belong to president prescott now its protocol  confirmed  know why chappelle called this meeting  no he just told everybody to save their work and get in here  this information is confidential  itll stay inside until its been made public which should be in the next few hours  the cabinet invoked the 25th amendment and removed david palmer from office   jim prescott is now the president  why  that isnt relevant to our charge   yes it is ryan  whats your problem almeida  we know palmer was removed cos he didnt wanna go on with the bombings  that makes what bauers doing more relevant  bauer has cried wolf twice already hes come up with nothing  i have an order from district that disallows any further resources  from being expended on him  why is everybody so afraid to look at all the sides of this what if bauers right  what if it was forged and were about to bomb three innocent countries  tony let me first say that your office has done a remarkable job today  there is no way the people on the hill are not going to reward every one of you  for your role in averting disaster   what does that have to do with anything  let me finish  the success of this office today is due in large part to the technical team  the same team that has concluded that the cyprus audio  is an untreated unforged original  there comes a time when you have to let go not every hunch works out  bauers chasing a ghost i cant put it any simpler than that  thats all   what are you gonna do  i have to talk to one of prescotts staff  if jack comes in with the evidence we need somebody in place to take it to  if chappelle finds out youre doing an end run  i know i know   the car is gone  ok   what do you wanna do  kingsley took anything important   we gotta find hewitt lets go  stop right there   sit down  let go of me  dont move dont move  who are you dont look at her look at me who are you   im nobody  hes my private bodyguard   secret service  ex   mrs palmer  jack bauer   stand up  why   stand up  what are you gonna do to me  turn around  im not carrying any weapons  take a seat   why are you here  trying to help david   youre no longer part of his life  dont believe everything you read  davids asked me to pool my resources to see if i can find out whos behind the bomb   i dont believe you  i dont care what you believe  do you know who did this who ransacked this place   youre here for the same reason i am  what reason would that be   to find alex hewitt  why   you must know youre here  why dont you tell me  he created a recording thats about to start a war  how do you know about that  i dont like the way this conversation is going   how do you know about cyprus audio  how dare you talk down to me  i am not a politician i will not debate this with you  answer me what do you know about the cyprus recording  every expert in the government with priority clearance  has been working on it for six hours ive got a lot of sources   what do you know about alex hewitt  that hes a freelance audio technician   who does he work for  a man named peter kingsley  why  kingsley represents caspian sea oils interests that want the us  at war with the middle east kingsley hired hewitt to fabricate the cyprus recording  mr bauer ive walked the corridors of power my entire life  youd be surprised how much information you can get if you have something to trade   what are you doing  take a seat  take a seat  come out  open the door slowly i wanna see both your hands now now  please dont hurt me   get on the ground  ok ok  dont move get on the ground who are you   mrs palmer  alex  you said you would help me why does he have a gun   shut up go sit with her  i didnt do anything wrong   move  you said youd  shut up dont say anything hes a federal agent   shut up  i am not talking to you   shut up  dont say anything alex  alex dont say anything  youre gonna talk to me now  you took voice samples from three leaders and intercut them with alis for the audio   i didnt say that  and kingsley paid you   no  youre a traitor   you know what theyll do to you  im not i didnt know i swear  i told mrs palmer shell tell you  forget about her she cant help you  but if you tell me everything about the cyprus audio ill do what i can   i wont say anything until i see a lawyer  i am your lawyer son  those people you worked for thought youd die in the bomb theyre after you  if you wanna stay alive start telling me everything  no i only wanna talk to mrs palmer  why her hows she connected to this how do you know her  i just met her today she called said she could help me  i know shes the presidents exwife shes got connections high up  she cant help you now alex im the only one who can help you now  i wanna to talk to her  ok let me see what i can do give me your keys   why  give me your keys   which one of these locks this door  this one  just step back   what did he say  why are you here  please dont tell me its to help the president  all right i came here to protect myself  alex was paid by kingsley to record certain conversations  some of those were with me they incriminate me  youre collaborating with peter kingsley  he assured me that the bomb would never go off  what were you thinking what the hell were you thinking   who are you calling  ctu  im a sworn federal agent you just confessed to a federal crime   i suggest you hang up that phone  i need to speak to tony almeida  i am the only one who can get hewitt to cooperate  and for that ill want full immunity from prosecution  now hang up the phone and ill tell you everything   jack its tony whats going on  im gonna have to get back to you  start   start  i wanted to bring down davids presidency  i was so angry with david for what he did to me  i worked tirelessly for years to put him into office i sacrificed everything  my career my family david betrayed me  so you wanted revenge what did kingsley want  money a war in the middle east would triple the value of his oil  youre here to ensure no one connects you to kingsley  yes like i told you i came to protect myself  look mr bauer theres only one person you need to prosecute for this  and that person is sitting in that room there  i want full immunity  otherwise its just your word against mine  shell talk with you   i know youre scared  you said i would be ok  i know theres been a little wrinkle but we can fix that  what do you think aaron you think im unfit to fulfil my duties as president  sir im under orders not to discuss this with you  are you under orders not to listen   no sir  good  then ill do all the talking i assume you remember jack bauer  he believes the cyprus recording  the single piece of evidence propelling us into this war  was fabricated  ive been removed from office because i believe in bauer  if it wasnt for jack los angeles would be a killing field by now  still prescott and the cabinet refuse to believe that he might be right  if jack finds the evidence after the planes have dropped their payloads  then itll be too late  we will be at war against three innocent countries  im sure if jack bauer finds evidence vice president prescott  i mean the president will recall the bombers   youre under orders not to speak to me  im doing my best sir   your best would be to help me  by doing what  i need to talk to jack bauer find out if hes secured the evidence  if i remember correctly you have a son in the navy  yes sir i do  its a fine thing to defend ones country you should be proud  lets make sure the cause hes fighting for is the just one  get me a sat phone i need a secure line  put these in the overnight database chappelles gonna need em for his briefing  why are you giving this to me this is your situation report  im on something else  what else  i dont have to explain myself to you carrie just do it  you do need to explain yourself  cos i think youre going behind chappelles back trying to help jack bauer  do you really wanna do this carrie come after me  ive been letting you get away with a lot but if you want the gloves to come off fine  whats going on here  shes asking me to take on some of her workload i just wanna know why  why dont you wanna tell her  its none of her business tony  look just tell her so we can get back to work here  all right  districts asked me to step in as a liaison to facilitate the power shift  ill be on the phone for the next two hours  sounds like a promotion congratulations   you think she believed me  no  go over it again look i need you to find it fast  even if you need to pull agents who can help you this needs to take first priority  divisions breathing down my neck for some reason   thats something i dont need  ill take care of it  all right   mr chappelle  yes carrie  in my opinion tony almeidas not fit to run ctu   why not  hes got michelle working off book   doing what  i cant say for sure  but i have a feeling the two of them are still trying to help bauer  thank you  itll be fine  here you go thanks   almeida  tony its jack   whats happening  president still holding off on the attack  things have gotten worse its not public but palmers been pulled   what do you mean  his cabinet invoked the 25th amendment  because he wanted to wait for confirmation of the recording  prescotts now president  ill bring evidence proving the recordings been forged prescott wont listen to it  he wont wait for it get me that evidence quickly and ill call prescott with it  start by sending a chopper to the address you gave me   i got hewitt  he definitely made the recording   yes absolutely  will he testify  were working on it  if i go to chappelle and request a chopper for you hell deny it   hes got orders from district  deal with it tony  we got bombers in the air hewitts our only chance of stopping this  ill do my best  ok thanks tony  i know alex i understand your concern  but the fact remains we both made a mistake  but were lucky because they need us  any deal i make will include you and vice versa remember were in this together  are you sure about this  honey i would never lie to you but you have to remember this one thing  i am the only one looking after your interest no one else  i know how these things work just do as i say and itll all turn out well  what about him  dont worry about him ill handle agent bauer he wont be a problem  hes very low on the food chain  so if i do this you can keep me out of jail  absolutely youll be granted full immunity just like i promised  ok  all right jack this is how its gonna work hell come in and testify  he can demonstrate the technology in a matter of minutes  good the choppers on its way  you heard chappelle he wont let us have a chopper if he knows its for jack  but jacks got hewitt who definitely made that recording   chappelle cant ignore that  he can do whatever he wants  yeah mmhm ok  let me get back to you marc   what  jack bauer just contacted us  really where is he   north hollywood  whats he doing  he wants to bring in the guy who forged the cyprus recording  fine let him  hes too far away we need to send a chopper  weve been through this tony im done with bauer  hes chasing a trail that leads nowhere were onto other things  more important than the us launching military strikes based on false information  the thing is tony youve been reassigned  reassigned where  ill let you know in a few days for now you can go home  ryan you cant reassign me now  this recording is real we are going to war we need to prepare for domestic response  you have made yourself a liability i just cant afford  youve got 15 minutes to clean out your desk and get out  what are you doing  they took the disk that had my comb filter ill need to rebuild that file to demonstrate  ok the tarball has to decompress itll take about 20 minutes   hows it gonna work  ill make a recording  right on the spot shift it around reframe segments  itll have the same specs as cyprus itll blow their minds   good  and then im free to go right  thats what she said  yes youll be fine alex  how come youre being so nice all of a sudden   what do you mean  before it was all my fault  you called me a traitor and now everythings fine alex   youre gonna screw me  we wont screw you  you two made a deal youre gonna hang me out  alex calm down we cant hang you out you have the proof   without you there is no deal  then i want it in writing   why cant i have an attorney  no time  there are bombers in the air to start a war   youll have to trust me  why should i trust you  why dont you have federal counsel meet us wherever were going   excuse me  one phone call   thats right we want federal counsel  no im not trading with you alex  youre gonna do your demonstration then i help you thats the deal thats it   i wanna talk to you in private  what are you doing   i handled everything  what are you afraid of  im the one who can make this happen i wanna talk to him alone  ok all right whatever you want ill be over here   whats going on  is she trying to screw me   no shes trying to help you  why i mean she doesnt even know me  maybe because she thinks you got tricked into doing something  you didnt fully understand  she wants to use her influence with the president to try and help you   because she thinks im innocent  yeah maybe  and i think she likes me  i think she does   do you need any help  no it should only be one suitcase   take your time ill be waiting in the car  thanks  he just reassigned you he didnt give any explanation  chappelle doesnt want me in the job hes got his own people and im not one of them  what are you going to do  tony its satcom   almeida  this is david palmer  mr president what can i do for you sir  i need to speak to bauer can you reach him   can you hold on sir  for a moment   yeah  jack its tony   i have president palmer on the line  ok good patch him through  how we doing on the chopper

you on your investigation  i can tell you the cyprus audio has been forged  i have the man who engineered it im bringing him in soon  well patch him through to the white house so he can testify  meanwhile ctu is trying to process everything they can on him  mr president there is something else though  what  your exwife sir sherry shes here with me  how did that happen   jack  yes sir   you cant talk  no sir  dont trust her jack do you understand  yes mr president   let me talk to her  he wants to talk with you   david  what are you trying to do   im just trying to help you  how can you help me  you shouldnt have lied to me  thats the problem david its not always about the truth  and whats that supposed to mean  the truth is the cyprus recording was forged you are right and they are wrong  the truth is youre trying to prevent an unnecessary war  and jack bauer and i are the only ones who can help you   stay out of his way sherry  all right all right david  let me talk to jack   yes mr president  i need this man to come forward now   i understand sir  all right thank you   tony you still there  im here   how much time have we got  six minutes   tony can you hear me  go ahead   we need that chopper now  youll have it  thank you  im gonna need your help  im still here at the matheson house   where is it sir  where is what  please david dont make me do this  give me the phone   place pierce under arrest  mike dont   i coerced him into getting it for me  you didnt coerce anyone  shame on you for placing us both in this position  it should be you putting yourself on the line instead aaron did   i tried to be a friend to you sir  i dont want a friend  i need someone to do the right thing  im sorry aaron  theres nothing to be sorry for mr president  officer is that you  hello   dessler  you ready   yeah  all right lets go   yeah  rudin needs you hes in holding room 2   tell him to call me  the comms out in that room  all right im on my way  wheres rudin  i got this go send that chopper to pick up jack   when are your people getting here  soon  its not just out of my own selfish desire that im trying to stay clean on all this  really  it wouldnt be good for davids presidency if his exwife was implicated in this bomb  so now you care about his presidency  in light of whats happened today my resentments seem obscenely petty  i dont know what i was thinking  theres something i havent told you yet about mr palmer   mr palmer  yes mr palmer  his cabinet invoked the 25th amendment less than an hour ago   what  prescotts president now  oh my god  you got what you wanted yeah  its tony the choppers about to leave etas about 20 minutes   so chappelles on board with us  not exactly   what do you mean  its better if you dont know  youll have to get the attorney general involved   what for  mrs palmer wants to cut a deal   a deal  hewitts testimony incriminates her   ill make sure its in place  it has to go like clockwork   theres no margin for error  i know  what did you mean i want to cut a deal  i explained to you that alex wont say anything without my permission  all i care about now is that he convinces prescott and the joint chiefs  that he forged the cyprus audio   after that youre free to try and cut a deal  that is not what we discussed   im sorry thats the way it is  well see about that  mrs palmer the conversations end here  you dont talk to him again do you understand me  dont try me mrs palmer  take a seat on the couch  kim  you know this is all your fault dont ya  carla would probably still be alive if it wasnt for you
