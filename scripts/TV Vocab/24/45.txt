                jim we both know that youve been one of the most outspoken opponents  to my decision to call off this attack  if you have something to say i would expect you to bring it to me first  does the president have any idea whats going on   i dont think so  lets keep it that way  thank you for assembling at such short notice  im sure youre all wondering why ive invited you here  it is my sincere belief based on his response to todays events  david palmer is unfit to continue as president of the united states  looks like youve had quite a day   i didnt kill anyone  i know you didnt  we know gary matheson killed his wife were looking for him now  so youre off the hook for everything that happened this morning  i thought i made myself clear tony were past bauer  no sir you are im not  now if youre not comfortable with me making my own decisions here  i suggest you relieve me of my duties right now  that wont be necessary   thank you sir  dont thank me  i just dont have anyone to take your place right now   no  come on give me that   kate are you all right  yeah theyve got the chip  all i want is the chip  you come in here im gonna smash this thing ill put it right under my foot   tell me who im speaking to  it doesnt matter  we got something your girlfriend was about to pay us for  listen to me  five hours ago a nuclear bomb went off im sure you know  the chip will show whos responsible its vital to our investigation  the man you assaulted was an agent bringing the chip to my office  give me the chip back and ill let you walk no questions   youre setting us up  get back  what are you doing they killed yusuf  were about to attack three innocent countries  i can only stop it with that chip so im gonna do everything i can to get it back  please kate i need your help get in touch with ctu please  you have 30 seconds to open that door   give it to him  are you crazy  this is the only thing keeping him from killing us  you got 20 seconds   we should trust you  you dont have a choice   give it to him hes serious  so am i  hes gonna kill us if we dont open the door  against the wall now wheres the chip  i dropped it  dont move  kate kate  i need wire to tie them up   what about the chip  ive got it  just got this pentagon briefing stating that our bombers arent going back to their bases  do you know about this  i understand theyre holding awaiting refuelling  i ordered them back to their bases  i know thats why im here could you come with me for a minute   come with you where  to the main conference room  whats going on mike  please mr president come with me  youre ordering me to the conference room  no sir of course not im sorry  im asking its very important sir  mike im the president of the united states  im not going anywhere until you tell me what this is about  mr president  it seems there are a number of people cabinet members  who question whether youre fit to continue as chief executive of this country  and these people are in my conference room  in a manner of speaking sir they are  then lets go see them  mr president  so now i see why i had such a hard time reaching you today jim  you were busy  i apologise if this comes as a surprise mr president  this is a unique situation in the history of our country  calling for unique measures  lets skip the sound bites and cut to the chase  whats going on here  mr president we are invoking the 25th amendment  whos we  theres a general feeling that the decisions made today  hold on a minute mr vice president  with all due respect sir most of us here are scrambling  just to understand todays events  i think its way too early to be referring to a general feeling about anything  fair enough for the record  let me review the relevant portions of the 25th amendment  if the vice president and the majority of the cabinet determine that the president is unable  to discharge the powers and duties of his office  the vice president shall take office as acting president everyone clear  the 25th amendment was designed for situations  where the president is ill or incapacitated  unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office  the reason for the disability isnt limited to any cause  the attorney general agrees with this interpretation  and just what exactly is my supposed disability  it seems clear to me that the stress of todays events has overwhelmed you  an atomic device has been detonated on american soil today  we have clear evidence which countries are responsible  along with details of the terrorist group they sponsor  the evidence implicating these countries is not clear mr prescott far from it  the cyprus audio has been independently verified by every intelligence group we have  i have reason to believe they are mistaken  because of this lone ctu agent jack bauer  yes mr bauer believes that the cyprus audio is a forgery  he also believes that he will soon have proof  hes been telling you that for hours mr president you still dont have proof  if military strikes do not go ahead  casualties to american soldiers would increase by tens of thousands of lives  that analysis is undisputed  the risk of attacking innocent countries is unacceptable we have to be sure  everybody is sure mr president everybody but you  as it happens im the only who counts  this meeting is over  mr president one way or another there will be a vote  i think that you should be heard before that vote is taken  you dont like one of my policy decisions  you do not have the right to reverse that policy under the pretence that im disabled  mr president i agree  i intend to show a pattern of erratic and irrational behaviour on your part  since the start of this crisis  in that light your refusal to authorise military action  is simply another symptom of disability  listen to me all of you  i know youre not in the same room with me  but you can see and hear me plainly enough  take a good look  do i seem scared  am i breaking into a nervous sweat  am i babbling at a loss for words  is my voice shaking  can any one of you look me in the eye and tell me im disabled  mr president the issue is not your demeanour over the past few minutes  but your actions over the past 20 hours  mr president the vice president has raised serious questions  and in my opinion it would be a mistake to ignore them  for my part im confident that if you explain yourself with your usual candour and clarity  all questions will be resolved to the satisfaction of everyone here  mr prescott there seems to be a collective feeling that a discussion is called for  in the interest of putting this behind us ill agree  on one condition when its over if im supported  you tender your resignation as the vice president of this country  very well mr president i agree  i suggest we all take a few minutes to compose ourselves  and get on with the proceeding  lets not mince words mr secretary you mean the trial of david palmer  all right the problem is that they dont correspond i need them to  ryan could i have a word with you please  give me a minute  i just got a message that the president called off the military offensive   who told you this  someone at doj   someone i trust  i wouldnt worry about it  is it true   yes  and you knew about it   i did  and you didnt tell me  why keep my people processing intel on a scrapped operation  because theres a strong possibility the white house will reinstate the attack  it doesnt make sense why would the president reverse his orders twice  just keep your people on a war footing  tony phones are up i got jack bauer on line two   where is he  kates house   why  i dont know but he has the chip  conferencecall him to my office  why are you at kates house you were supposed to bring that chip here  we ran into some interference yusuf auda is dead   what happened  no time to explain  hes the only reason we still got this chip im trying to read it now  i tried a flash card adapter but its not working  you may be able to override the reader function manually ill talk you through it  good tony while shes setting up run a background check on peter kingsley  it may be an alias crossreference it with every major player in the oil industry   peter kingsley why  ill explain later  first tell the president that weve got the evidence he needs  i told him i found out hes called off the military strikes  then weve got time  not necessarily chappelle said the order may be reversed  why  he didnt get specific but somethings going on  in washington that were not supposed to know about   michelle are you ready for me  yeah  ive asked someone to join us  most of you know ron wieland  ron is a highly respected national affairs correspondent  he had a very interesting experience earlier today ron  i was covering mr palmers environmental speech when i began to sense a bigger story  there were rumours of a terrorist attack on the west coast involving a nuclear device  i kept asking questions next thing i know i was called in to talk to the president  he asked me to keep the story under wraps until later then hed give me an exclusive   what did you say  that id think it over  as i was leaving a secret service agent grabbed me and hustled me into a room  i was kept there under guard for several hours  did you feel this was a violation of your rights as a journalist and an american  of course   ron were you harmed or threatened  no sir  did you understand the reason for your being detained  i assume it was fear that if word got out of a nuclear threat panic would strike  do you think the lives of thousands of citizens is less important  than a couple of hours of your first amendment rights  no i dont but under the bill of rights  that decision was mine not yours mr president  did you feel that things were out of control in the palmer administration  youre putting words in his mouth  i did sense the president was not in control  i was trying to balance the need for public safety against ron wielands rights  i offered ron a deal and he turned me down  nothing was out of control i might add i had legal precedent for my action  thank you mr wieland  id like to call someone else to testify he should be ready in a few moments  control cx5 then hit enter   done  anything  i think its reading it no all im getting are numbers and symbols  take out the chip make sure the leads are exposed   damn it  what is it   the chip is damaged  how badly  part of the microprocessor is gone and the leads connected to it  send me any data you have to run through our retrieval program  can you access a complete audio file  if its on there ill find it   it  this is almeida   send two guys up here  theyre all doing mi for chappelle  i dont care i need two it people now   chappelle specifically  just do it i gotta go  almeida  tony hi its kim look i havent been able to reach my dad is he available  were in the middle of something important can he call you back  tony please itll just take a minute  ok ok just hold on  are you getting it  yeah i got it but you were right  the data is pretty screwed  ive assigned two it people to help michelle  we should get through it in 15 20 minutes   ok good  also i got kim on the line for you  thank you tony  kim i got your dad on the line go ahead   dad  sweetheart   ive been trying to reach you  are you at the sheriffs station  theyre taking me to the mathesons house to pack up my things  glad youre ok  me too  when i thought you were gone i  i just miss you dad i miss you so much  ive missed you too honey  i just wanna come home  youll be home soon enough i promise ok  ok hey dad   yeah  i love you  i love you too baby  ill see you soon ok  bye  you knew about this didnt you mike how long have you known   that doesnt matter mr palmer  it matters to me  how long  a couple of hours  you were part of it werent you  when alls said and done you were on prescotts side  no sir im on your side and always will be  this could be a good thing  a chance to correct a mistake of historic proportion  david im begging you reconsider your position on this  im the president mike  you dont call me by my first name  yes sir  its transmitting  gentlemen im sorry for the delay  the man youre about to see is not entirely well  in fact its taken a great deal of courage for him to join us at all  roger stanton head of the national security agency  roger thank you for speaking with us  yes of course sorry if i seem a bit tired  i was tortured for several hours at the operations complex  by order of the president of the united states  and why were you tortured  because you thought i knew more than i was saying about the location of the bomb  as if the head of nsa would withhold information from the president  youre lying this may work for a while but eventually the truth will come out  i have nothing to fear from the truth mr president  as briefly as possible mr stanton tell us what happened to you today  i arrived at the oc around noon to find that my assistant director eric rayburn  had been dismissed by the president  what was the reason given for mr rayburns firing  eric wanted to bring the military into the equation right away and the president  was reluctant to even contemplate the use of military action  thats not true  for the next few hours i worked for the president as best i could  he was indecisive erratic and as i said  terrified to even think of military engagement  a little after six this evening i was arrested on the charge of treason  i was taken to a small windowless room  the president accused me of knowing more about the bomb than i was telling him   was that true  no of course not  in fairness to the president i think he genuinely believed it to be true  why would he hold such a belief  david palmer is a decent man  maybe hes too decent for the times we live in  he wanted to avoid war at any cost  if he could prove to himself that americans were behind the bomb  then hed have a good reason not to use military force against any foreign country  i just heard you ordered two its onto a retrieval project  they were working military intel  jack bauer has a chip  it contains an audio file that we expect will prove the cyprus audio was forged  where is this chip   its been damaged  damaged  the data jack sent us is messed up  the audio file has to be reconstituted that takes time   how long  however long it takes  it should take about 15 minutes sir  mr chappelles office   get a message to the vice president  right away sir  ready to tell me everything i need to know  continue  we knew about the bomb weeks ago  enough  this should end this discussion here and now  yes i had roger stanton tortured  it was a horrible thing to do god knows i hated doing it  but just as i suspected he knew about the bomb  youve just seen that  when i was strapped to a chair  and thousands of volts of electric current passed through my body every few seconds  im not proud of it but i dare say i did what most of you wouldve done  i cracked  told the president what he wanted to hear that i knew about the bomb  you told me more than that you told me about the coral snake team  you told me that the bomb was at norton airfield information that we corroborated  i dont know what youre talking about  mr prescott play the rest of the tape  there is no rest of the tape   what  thats all i have  that cant be i was in that room for another ten minutes  this is all that was transmitted by the oc we did ask for everything  there must be a mistake or deliberate sabotage  mr stanton had a lot more to say than what you just saw  mr president couldnt agent simmons verify what youve been telling us  no i sent him out of the room  but the fact remains that roger stanton told me about the coral snake team  and the location of the bomb where else could that information have come from  we have many intelligence agencies mr president  thousands of agents combing the planet  it couldve come from anywhere i know it didnt come from me  thats a lie and you know it tell them mike  i only know what the president told me  i wasnt in the room  mr stanton thank you again  you will remain in custody as the president has ordered until this matter is resolved  i understand  mr president if you have any evidence youd like to present please do so now  the testimony thats been presented here so far is inaccurate and incomplete  roger stanton is directly responsible for placing a nuclear weapon on us soil  i have evidence that proves it but youve given me no time  while my behaviour may have been extreme  i was just responding to the extremity of todays events  make no mistake if we unleash our military power on nations that later prove innocent  it will rank as one of the most despicable sneak attacks in history  any chance for peace in the middle east will vanish forever  even if it costs american lives in the future  we must delay the attack until we are certain of our ground  excuse me  i just received an urgent message from ctu division chief ryan chappelle  jack bauer has evidence he claims will prove the cyprus audio was forged  please everyone sh please settle down  the evidence is being reviewed at ctu now  mr chappelle says that the analysis shall be complete within the next few minutes  considering the impact that this evidence will have on these proceedings  i think its incumbent upon us to wait   im looking at it right now  we cant configure it either   did you run it through default mode  the audio files are gone  theyre just some markers that repeat   thanks jason  all right  he didnt find anything either  well what have you got  the chip was more compromised than we thought   do you have the audio file  michelle recovered some information  it may tell us who programmed it  did you find the audio file thats all i need to know  no we didnt  so bauer wasted our time  come on  kate  kate are you all right  everything thats happened today everything thats still happening  i keep thinking its all my fault  come here we would never have found the bomb in time if it wasnt for you  my sister was the one behind the bomb she helped those fanatics  yes but youre not your sister  i shouldve seen something was wrong before it got this bad  because of what she did it could start a war  i couldve stopped it  no kate you couldnt have  there are things in this world that are out of our control  sometimes we blame ourselves for them so that we can try and make sense out of it  come here  there was nothing you could have done  sorry yeah  its tony and michelle  excuse me   you got the audio file  no  what do you mean are you saying theres no audio file on that chip  if there were they were destroyed  chappelle wants you in on a call to the president  yeah i bet he does  some of the information michelle recovered may be worth looking into  what information  identical code fragments in several data streams   what are the fragments for  nothing thats the point  its junk code programmers sometimes embed it into their programs as a signature  michelle traced the sequence to a hacker named alex hewitt  hes got a file with the fbi  you think this is the technician that created the cyprus audio  yes  we cant follow up any more leads so you have to talk to this guy  whats his last known address  north hollywood  i got it ill get back to you  all right   im sorry ive gotta go  where  we got something off the chip not what were looking for but its a lead  when youre ready an officer will take you back to ctu so you can be with your father  thanks  ok   jack  yeah  be careful  thanks i will be  squadrons have been in a holding pattern since the president called off the attack  they just refuelled  if we want to resume the operation we need to come to a conclusion now  a few more minutes this is the difference between peace and war mr prescott  its also a pattern thats been recurring over the last few hours  everything will change once mr bauer calls it just never quite happens   yes what  ctu  jack bauer and ryan chappelle are on the line   this is president palmer  this is ryan chappelle   hello  jack bauer is on the line as well  hell give you an update  mr president i found the chip unfortunately its been badly damaged  can it prove that the cyprus recording was forged  in its present condition it proves nothing   can it be repaired  no sir but about an hour ago  i was tortured by men who wanted the chip  they worked for peter kingsley hes part of the group behind the bomb  theyve manipulated todays events to start this war  what  to improve their oil contracts in the caspian sea  and to control the oil coming out of the middle east  i need something concrete evidence  i understand im checking up on an address of a man  who we believe engineered the recording for kingsley its the best weve got  everything youve seen  are you absolutely convinced the cyprus recording was forged  yes sir absolutely  all right jack thank you  the evidence i was hoping for is not yet available but i believe it will be soon   when mr president  i dont know  meanwhile the window for a surprise attack is rapidly closing  its time to vote  mr vice president if you could indulge me for one minute  mr president  this bauer thing is an illusion a mirage  every time you get near it it moves further away  for your sake for the countrys authorise the attack  all this will just go away  and a lot of people americans and nonamericans will die for no reason  we dont know that mr president  lets get on with the vote  members of the cabinet youve been presented with the evidence  you know whats at stake  those of you who believe the president is able to continue in office vote yes  those of you who believe he isnt vote no  mr novick will conduct a voice poll  the numbers will be reflected on the screen  mr novick  ms secretary of transportation how do you vote  yes  mr secretary of treasury  no  yes   almeida  its jack  im half a block from hewitts loft has the fbi sent over his file yet   yeah  what do i need to know  the state department recruited him he revamped their entire surveillance program  he got caught manipulating files that he didnt have clearance for  he tried to kill himself spent a year in psychiatric prison  then was released last september   no connection to kingsley  no not that we can find  as soon as i get hewitt ill get back to you  any word on whats happening with the president   no not yet  ok thanks  mr secretary of defence how do you vote  yes i believe the president should stay in office  mr secretary of agriculture  no  mr secretary of the interior  no  mr secretary of state the vote is seven for and seven against   yours is the deciding vote  im aware of that  ive never met a man that i respected more than you mr president never  but we are talking about tens of thousands of american lives  im compelled to vote no  mr president can you see the results  you will have an opportunity to appeal this in four days in front of congress  in the meantime i must ask you to remove yourself from the decisionmaking process  please take the president to a holding room  will you please come with us mr president  mr president im not a lawyer sir  but as far as i can tell the constitutions been followed  ive got no choice but to ask you to come with us  im sorry sir  i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute  the office of the president of the united states and will to the best of my ability  preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states  so help me god  come on  alex
