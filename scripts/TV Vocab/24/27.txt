whered you get this  jack bauer  they wanna cripple ctus investigation divert attention away from the major strike   i agree  has bauer contacted ctu  he couldnt get through phone lines are down   somehow we have to warn ctu  no we dont   we cant  what are you talking about  if walds crew fails theyll think somebody tipped off ctu  theyll figure out it was bauer  are you seriously suggesting we just let these people at ctu die   jack bauer gave specific instructions  why isnt he stopping them  because he knows hes gotta keep his cover intact  he knows if hes exposed he cant get to wald and we lose our only chance to find the nuke   this is the presidents decision  hes telling the press its business as usual  weve already detained ron wieland illegally we cant muzzle the entire press corps   we still have to tell the president  we will when hes in a position to hear it   it will be too late by then  lynne this is my call  i dont work for you   jenny dodge  its lynne i need to

maybe not   get out of my way  dont do this lynne  you do not want me for an enemy i promise   are you threatening me  just giving you some strong advice  whats going on  jack bauer called he said that walds crew is planning to blow up ctu  its a nonnuclear strike which suggests that its a secondary target   when  were not sure bauer got cut off   have you called ctu  thats what we were debating  debating  right now wald is our only thread to finding the nuke but bauer hasnt got to wald yet  if we stop walds crew they may realise it was bauer that turned them in  in the meantime im having ctu transfer their intel  so our only losses would be infrastructure and personnel  those losses are unacceptable contact ctu immediately  yes sir   think im making a mistake  i do sir  tony that guy over there hes asking to see you  he claims he was taken hostage by these men that wanna blow up ctu  he said there are bombs planted here here and here ill have a squad check it out   order an evacuation  we dont know  this is why nsa wanted us to transfer over our database  they knew we were being targeted and didnt say a thing we have to evacuate now  everyone listen up  this is lynne kresge im calling to tell you about a possible threat to ctu  we just found out about it nsa knew about this a half an hour ago   thats why rayburn wanted our files  right now get your people out  i want you to go down this hallway and calmly clear everyone out   whats going on  were evacuating   im looking for tony almeida  im sorry weve gotta go right now   i need you to move a little faster  no leave your things behind   what are you doing  im almost done with the encryption   leave it theres a bomb  we cant lose this data  would you leave it come on  lets go come on hurry hurry   we did it jack  good job eddie good job  were too late ctu was just hit   i want mommy  i know  its ok  youre clean  then why so grim  the tests are back from the field analysis  the substance you inhaled is well its plutonium  based on the particle size atmospheric saturation length of time you were exposed  cut to the chase doctor  your radiation exposure level is high definitely lethal  how much time do i have  could be as much as a week or as little as a day  im sorry
