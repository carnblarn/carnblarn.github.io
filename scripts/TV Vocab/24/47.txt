you tell me carrie  you called chappelle in to see rudin i just talked to rudin   he doesnt know anything about it  well of course he told you that  his system wasnt loaded properly and it was your fault  he wanted to see chappelle to complain about you  stay out of my business carrie youll do a better job  brian how did you find out about me  the attorney general said youd want me for your counsel   what have they told you  youd been removed from office  under the 25th amendment   is what they did legal  technically yes  the cabinet can declare the president incompetent  without further definition or clarification   that also gives me the right to appeal  yes which i will do vigorously   unfortunately its a lengthy process  we dont have time   i dont know how to make it go any faster  none of those legalities matter  were about to go to war based on evidence that i am convinced is false  no one outside this room believes that  the evidence was manipulated by a man named peter kingsley  i need you to find out all you can about him  mike novicks tying my hands  get him to untie them  whatever you have to do  yes sir   almeida  im in place   where are you  im in the north lot  van 15a listen tony carries onto us   she was asking about chappelle  what did you tell her  that i didnt know anything but we need her out of the way   keep her occupied  ok ill handle it get ahold of jack  i gotta go hammonds here   mr hammond  tony   what are you doing here  i told you on the phone  i think theres a problem here wheres ryan chappelle   i havent seen him yet sir  i see  two of you take this side  i want this section covered   what are you doin  im locking you down  were in the middle of preparing a domestic response to this war  thats not what i heard i heard you were supporting a rogue agent against orders   whered you hear that  one of your people  lets go cover every square inch of the place   im aware of that  that flyover space is critical   will david help us  i dont know  mike  i dont see us having much success with him   we need this mike  yes sir ill try how is he  david is convinced his decision to hold off on the bombers was correct  hell appeal his removal from office   the 25th amendment gives him that right  well prove were being manipulated  and that the cyprus recording was falsified plus we now think we know by whom   im listening  a man named peter kingsley  hes got ties to oil interests both here and abroad  have you found anything to connect him to the cyprus recording or the bomb  no we wont be able to without access to the intelligence database  davids locked down until weve gone public with the military action   by then itll be too late  im sorry  mike wait just hold on a second  i remember when you signed up for davids first run at the senate over 20 years ago  thats thats a lot of history to just throw out the window  come on mike  i know you just did what you thought was right but let him try to prove his case  you owe him that  ill have colleen set up a computer station for you  you wont be able to transmit outgoing messages  thats fair enough   whats in here  a holding room no ones in there now  all right   and this  the other holding room  it shouldnt be locked   whats wrong  someone must have reconfigured the lock  come on alex keep talking to me  everythings a little blurry  whats happening to me  nothing you just banged your head its gonna be all right ok  you just hang in there  alex i can hear em theyre coming ok  helps on the way just hang in there ok  ive located the ctu chopper that tony almeida sent to jack bauer  theyre landing would you like them to detain bauer  no i dont wanna waste any more resources on him  just get the chopper back here  mr chappelle wants you to come back now   were about to land  i know   i can see him  just do it  what are you waiting for   im putting her down  no cancel that  land the chopper now  what are you doing land the damn chopper  my witness is gonna die land  your orders are to pick us up pick us up now  damn it   dessler  the chopper wont pick us up   hammonds locked us down  i dont give a damn  get me that chopper back hewitt is dying  alex   want me to deal with almeida  no brad thanks ill take care of him myself   michelle its me  jack where are you  going back to hewitts loft set up and be ready to interface with his computer   what about hewitt  he didnt make it hes dead  im sorry  call me when youre ready   yes  i need to speak with you  it concerns national security  as i am not the commander in chief any more thats irrelevant  we have a problem with the turkish government  our stealth bombers are nearing their airspace  but one of their fighter patrols spotted them a few minutes ago  ask the prime minister for the flyover he should agree  the secretary of state has spoken to him   hell grant us this under one condition  whats the condition  he wants a personal request and assurances from the president  the prime minister doesnt know ive been removed from office  he couldnt be told before the american people  that wouldnt be right would it mike  now that the bombers have been spotted  its critical that they get to their targets quickly  any detour will take them over unfriendly skies  you want me to speak to the prime minister under the pretence that im still the president  yes  this mission is going to continue regardless sir  this phone call no matter how distasteful  could prevent those planes from being attacked  we only have minutes sir  why did you leave me like this ive been stabbed  let me look at it  be careful  youre lucky the wounds superficial  the bleedings already stopped ill get you a clean bandage for it   wheres alex  he fell hes dead  oh my god what happens now  you are going to help me  just put this right here   help you do what  we got one last play   to deliver kingsley  no  hes far too dangerous and youll never get close to him  youre right i wont but you will  kingsley doesnt know hewitts been killed  if you say you can deliver him that should get his attention  kingsley has evidence that will implicate me there is no way  mrs palmer you  what  its nothing im fine  dont tell me its nothing whats going on  my heart stopped when kingsleys men were interrogating me  your heart could be damaged you need to get to a doctor  we need to get kingsley first  mrs palmer you are going to help me  im not gonna give you another choice  you wouldnt dare hurt me  make no mistake about it i will do what i have to do  what do you want me to do  tell kingsley youll exchange hewitt for any evidence that incriminates you  hell want proof that i have hewitt   hell get it  how  hewitts gonna talk to him  at this point we can assume the chip containing the source recordings  has not landed in government hands  did you intercept the federal agent who was in possession of the chip  no but since the bombers are still on course  we can assume that he wasnt able to deliver it to the president  which leaves hewitt as the last remaining loose end where are we on finding him  i have several teams out looking for him  he cannot be allowed to talk not now nor ever  hewitt will be found and hell be eliminated  clean this up peter  go over it again even if you need to pull a couple of agents in to help you  i dont need to tell you youre under arrest   wheres michelle dessler  she knew nothing about this  she called me to the room where you drugged me  she didnt know what i was gonna do  i need to issue a warrant contact local police issue a memo   i can find her  how  this whole things been about helping jack bauer shes doing that somewhere offsite   how do we find her  track her access code  see if shes logged onto the ctu computer network   then do it  right away  put him in holding 2   yeah  im connected to his computer  press escape and i can take control   done  what did hewitt tell you  he had a program that could recreate anybodys voice  with a voice sample he could get it to say anything  he kept all the audio files in a main file  all right i think ive found it  ive never seen this samples connect through an integrator   i need anything with hewitts voice on it  all right hold on  im gonna need berkeley and wilkerson at that lunch   is that him  no damn it  theres hundreds of files hold on  mrs palmer when did you call hewitt   last night around midnight why  he might have recorded it  michelle can you filter the audio files by time and date  let me see yeah  find an audio file that was recorded late last night or early this morning around midnight  this must be it   hello  alex hewitt   whos this  thats him   sherry palmer  we have to let it run  what are you calling me for  i know all about your relationship with peter kingsley  i dont know him  i also know you had all his phone conversations recorded  let me ask you was that to protect yourself or to blackmail him  its ok alex   im here to help you  who

charge us with  they could push for treason if they wanted to  think they will  depends on how big of an example they wanna make of us  look michelle  no one can prove that you knew what i was gonna do to chappelle  im gonna tell them that you were helping jack under my orders all right  no  what do you mean no  i did what i thought was right i still believe that  and i wont let you lie for me  david  thank you i know how difficult it must have been for you  how much longer will prescott keep me here  until after the press conference  ive requested you be released sooner but theres only so much i can do  i spoke to brian he requested some lowsecurity access on your behalf  i wanted you to know i granted it  so whats going on with you and my dad  excuse me  out of everyone he could have called he called you  theres gotta be a reason  i dont think he trusts very many people  he trusts you   is it true you guys just met today  yesterday really but yeah it is  i dont resent it or
