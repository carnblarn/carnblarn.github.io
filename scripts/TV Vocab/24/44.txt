                jack bauer just called with some new information  he has evidence the cyprus recording is counterfeit  im calling off the attack  stopping and restarting military action could cost tens of thousands of american lives  an acceptable risk if the alternative is waging war against three innocent countries  what do you know about section 4 of the 25th amendment  if the majority of his cabinet feels hes unfit to fulfil his duties  the president could be removed from office  and the vice president becomes acting president  as far as im concerned its prescott who should be charged with treason   i was afraid youd say that lynne  mike  until you hear from me do not let her out  i can lure them away from here you and kate get the chip over to ctu  meet me at moorpark and vineland if im not there in 15 minutes get it to tony almeida  yusuf behind you  hes a damn towel head  stop it  we got the evidence that proves the cyprus audio was forged  its a memory chip containing the original source recordings  do not kill him until he talks  jack i need the chip  its not for sale my answers final  when ronnies finished youll give me another  the chip jack  hes dead  if you are just joining us  the white house has confirmed the blast in the mojave desert  that occurred four hours ago at1059pm ps was in fact a nuclear explosion  well stitch you up and get you out of here and on your way   what are you doing here  looking for epinephrine  this is a treatment room i have a patient   wheres the epinephrine  storage room  lets go  clear  nothing  go again increase the joules  you are not gonna die on me you son of a bitch   thats kingsley you talk to him  yes   let me talk to stark  hes a little busy sir   did bauer give you the chip  no sir not yet  whats taking so long  its under control  what am i hearing in your voice  answer me raymond  stark pushed bauer too far  hes flatlining  whatever he broke hed better fix  and if ronnie cant handle it do it yourself   wheres the epinephrine  the doctors got it   if you dont revive this man youre dead  i need your men to put him on the gurney  put him up on the gurney  give him as much as he can take  lets go lets

that chip  well be convening the cabinet within the hour  does the president have any idea whats going on   i dont think so  its critical he doesnt find out  its not going to be that easy  lynne kresge was about to warn him but i was able to intervene  where is she now  i had to put her under guard  i know its difficult its difficult for all of us   i just hope were doing the right thing  mike  do you think these are the circumstances in which i wish to assume the presidency  you know me better than that  this country was attacked with a nuclear weapon  and the president will not commit to a military response  i hope youre not wavering yourself  no im not  good  so your responsibility is to make sure that the cabinet votes to remove him from office  i have a responsibility to make sure the vote takes place not to manipulate the outcome  poor choice of words  but my point is the same  youre doing the right thing mike history will recognise that   anything from jack bauer  not that ive heard  mike  i know you think delaying a military response is the wrong call  only because youre relying on a single source  jack bauer says he has evidence that were being manipulated into this war  i have to give him the opportunity to produce the proof  if there were anything i could say to make you change your mind  there isnt  look mike  i know this is an unpopular decision  and even though you dont agree either your standing by me means a great deal  send lynne into my office shes drafting my statement   ill see if i can find her  what do you mean  she wasnt feeling well she took a few minutes downtime last i heard  thats fine let her rest  ill go over it with jenny  please open this door whoever you are you are conspiring against the us president  do you have any

youve got to get out of here alive  we dont have any time come on  do it  feed it through the bottom hurry  hurry  hes coming   what are you doing  i had to disconnect his iv first   get the beroglide  yes sir  start him off with 2cc   mr chappelle  hi   is tony in his office  he went to it hell be a minute   whats the status on the phones  grids down in most of the city   how about wireless  cell service is pretty much out too   are you using satcom  yeah  save satcom for your highest priorities were sharing it with half a dozen other agencies  ok  tony  hey ryan  good work  good work on what  i know bauers trying to change our position on the cyprus audio   thats not exactly true  whatever you dont have to explain  im just glad youre not letting the tail wag the dog  ryan uh  jack may not be wrong about this hes  wait wait i dont wanna hear that  were about to bomb the middle east into next wednesday  were supposed to be processing intel to support that   ive got most of my people on it  i want all your people on it  dont you think we need to eliminate doubt about the authenticity of this recording  your department has already authenticated that recording  dont make me the bad guy here tony  mason may have recommended you to direct ctu but youll need my blessing to stay on  i assume thats what you want  what i want is to do whats right in this situation  whats right is to follow the chain of command  put everyone on domestic response  no   god damn it  calm down  what do you mean you cant get through to him   unreachable i want him now  ill try again sir  aaron   yes mr president  close the door please   how many presidents have you worked for  i came in on reagans second term  i havent been able to establish contact with my vice president in the last halfhour  what do you make of that  i wouldnt know how to respond to that mr president  i just pulled our bombers out of the air against everyones recommendations  now my vice president suddenly is unreachable   should i draw any conclusions  sir im not qualified to give an opinion  aaron youve been doing this nearly 20 years  you know how the system works  is prescott planning something behind my back   im going 2010 please cover position three  roger that  for what its worth i think the choices youve made today have been the right ones   thats not what i asked  there are always those in the administration  who feel that delay is a weakness   if enough individuals share this view then  aaron  is prescott coming after me  im not sure  but you have good instincts sir id listen to em if i were you   thank you aaron  yes sir  max is very unhappy  max can be unhappy were all entitled to our feelings  peter spare me your usual metaphysical observations  our entire project depends on military action the president just suspended   for now  now is all that matters  now youre being metaphysical  peter  palmer wont be able to stand the political pressure from his own administration  let alone the will of the people  hes not gonna have any choice but to respond to the nuclear weapon  youre assuming that this man bauer hasnt already delivered proof to his people  that the cyprus audio was false  bauer wont be a problem   tell me where the chip is ill make it stop  youll kill him  no but hell wish hed stayed dead  im all done playing games with you  now tell me what i wanna know tell me   theyll hear you upstairs  then shut up and close the door  fill the syringe and double the dosage  ill tell you where the chip is  where  again  its in  its in a p  what did you say  theyre taking the chip to  theyre taking it where  stay down  how much longer has he got before hes dead  as long as 15 minutes  you tell me who was on the other end of that phone and ill make it quick  peter kingsley   you wanted to see me sir  yes close the door please  have a seat mike  ive been feeling a little disconnected from my people in the last hour  ive been managing the joint chiefs and homeland security if you want me closer  not you mike back in washington   who  prescott  i think hes avoiding me  with what weve gone through in the last 18 hours  hes just being pulled in ten different directions  we were and in some ways still are on the brink of war  im the commander in chief when i call theres only one direction  absolutely ill get him on the phone right away  do that oh and mike  this statement that jenny made a pass on its not working   whats the problem  the facts arent updated  and i dont think jennys been apprised of everything i want lynne to go over it  why dont you give it to me ill get it to her  thank you  prescott  its mike novick can you talk  yeah   are you going forward or not  of course nothings changed   the sooner you can execute the better  were going as fast as we can here  david palmer is not a stupid man he knows something is going on  it wont take him long to figure out what it is   how does he know  for one thing you havent returned his calls   ill call him now  i think thats a good idea  mike im counting on you you gotta keep him busy until i can get everyone together   how much longer  a halfhour 45 minutes tops  the

cell or land line  ok  yes sir  whats that all about  jack bauer tried to contact us we lost connection  i said i dont want bauer distracting you or your resources  whatever hes doing out there is irrelevant  im not so sure it is jack says hes got proof that the cyprus audio was fabricated   hes bringing it here within the hour  if hes got proof let him produce it  but i want you to keep your eye on the ball tony  jim we both know youve been one of the most outspoken opponents  to my decision to call off this attack  any criticisms i may have had have been expressed behind closed doors  out of reach of any public scrutiny  i know we havent had a chance to talk oneonone since all this began  so if you have something to tell me go ahead  theres nothing sir  my door is always open jim  if you have something to say i would expect you to bring it to me first   of course mr president  thanks for getting back to me   i still dont trust him  what do you want me to do   sorry to interrupt sir  what is it  lynne kresge is injured she fell down some stairs   what happened  were not sure  it appears she may have been running from a fire in an upstairs room   is she ok  onsite physician

around here about two hours ago   to get to ctu hed take the 101 or the 5  do you want me to pull up the satellite  no that would raise a red flag with chappelle which is the last thing i need  what

priority one  ladies and gentlemen we can begin  id like to thank you for assembling at such short notice  im sure youre all wondering why ive asked you here  why ive asked you to keep the news of this meeting to yourselves  excuse me mr vice president shouldnt we wait for the president  president palmer will be joining us later  im not sure i understand you  the first part of this meeting will be a closed session   closed to the president  im afraid thats the point of the meeting  to some of you this will come as a surprise  for most of you though i hope it comes as a relief  but it is my sincere belief that based on his response to todays events  david palmer is unfit to continue as president of the united states
