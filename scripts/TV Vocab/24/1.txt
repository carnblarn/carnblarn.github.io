i think this is about him i want us to be prepared  bad time to play a hunch  if it leaks out that were screening him people might think its cause hes black  it is because hes black  it makes him the most likely target  it might not be interpreted that way on the outside  i dont care how its interpreted  i just gave you an order and id like you to follow it please  good thank you  let me know as soon as walsh gets here ive got to make a phone call  hey   how are you  good  come on lets go in  hi  you must be rick  i must be  janet said you guys like to party  as a matter of fact yeah  as a

on  good   mr walsh  hello nina   shall we get started  please  we believe that by the end of the day  an attempt will be made on david palmers life   how goods his security  very good  maybe not good enough to handle whats coming today  a shooter wellfunded from overseas  what foreign power wants palmer dead  probably none  most likely a domestic hategroup hired someone from out of the country  its harder to trace  check the background of everyone around palmer  cross it with terrorist databases   start now  okay were on it lets go  jack  ill be right with you  how you doing  i cant complain  cant or wont  things better at home  yeah were trying  what im about to tell you doesnt leave this room  fine  there may be an element inside the agency   involved with this hit  what  for the next 24 hours i want you all over this  youll be interfacing with every division in the region  i am the last person on this planet you want to bring something like this to   i dont agree  richard  i built a case against three of our own agents and busted them for taking bribes  if theres a conspiracy in the agency to kill palmer ill never get near it  well youll have to jack  cause youre the only guy that i can trust  if palmer gets hit  the first africanamerican with a real shot at the white house  itll tear this country apart  ill look into it ill do the best i can  good  george mason is coming from division to give you a detailed briefing on palmer  you think i should trust george mason  until we get a better handle on things  dont trust anybody  not even your own people  we got to find the
