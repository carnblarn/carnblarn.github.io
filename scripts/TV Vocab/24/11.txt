shut up  my name is jack bauer since midnight my wife and daughter have been missing  i have reason to believe theyre being held by a colleague of yours  a man named gaines  where are they  i dont know what you are talking about  wheres my wife and daughter  for gods sakes im just a businessman  thats right an ordinary businessman riding around in a bulletproof limousine   yes for protection  from what  people like you  this is your last chance  where is my family  i swear to you i dont know what youre talking about  youre a very good liar  but ive seen better  you stay put  its nina myers  hey its me can you talk  let me open a secure line  okay were clear   has teri called back yet  no  whats green doing  shes making herself at home in your office   she talk to you yet  yes  i told her i severed all ties with you  from now on i play on the side of the angels   did she buy any of it  not a word  ive got cofell  what do you mean got  ive got him in the back of his limousine   has he told you anything  im working on it  in other words youve kidnapped him  hes the only link to teri and kim that ive got  you dont even know if hes the right ted cofell  every time i talk to you you go further out on a limb  from the second they were taken you tell me one thing  i could have done differently  i dont know i guess youre right  but jack i dont know how much longer i can cover for you  nina please  just focus and stay calm i need you right now  look i dont think cofell will be easy to break i need help  you want me to put together an interrogation profile in what 15 minutes  ill give you about five  nina  if i cant break cofell i wont be able to find my family do you understand  ill do what i can  thank you  im gonna look for a place to lay low for awhile  ill get back to you as soon as i can  your father will find us  if he doesnt the people that work for him will  how they dont know where we are we dont know where we are  they were tracing the call kim  did they find our location before the battery went dead  we have to hope that they did yes  sorry about the phone  thank you for helping us we were hoping  i dont want to know anything  trust me its better for you if i dont know anything  what do you mean  eli sent me in here to a get information from you guys  but cant tell him what i dont know right  whatevers going on dont tell me about it  whats he gonna do to you  rick   whatd they say  nothing man  dude dont hold out on me  they dont trust me  i saw the way that kid looks at you she must have said something  who was the guy i talked to was it her father   they wouldnt say  youre lying  stop it  leave him alone  i was reviewing the report on the passenger list  there was an anomaly in first class  yeah the manifest had been altered to look like  there was an empty seat but we dont think there was one  who was actually in the seat  the photographer martin belkin  so the real photographer was killed in the explosion  and the assassin took his place at the breakfast  he was enough of a lookalike to fool security  and according to secret service he had a legitimate id not a forgery  how did he get it  that were still working on  myers hey its me  hi bill can you hang on a minute  its bill warner at the bureau  shall i call him back  no i need to speak to him  let me have the phone  alberta  ive got something you should probably take a look at  tell bill ill call him later  the hitters connection to germany may actually lead to the balkans  all right  our sources say our guy is probably a macedonian  hey im here   bad timing  no problem  i could have used a few more minutes  i wish i had them give me what youve got  the guys flight originated in croatia  all right hes the oldest of three children  his father died when he was a boy  that means he learned responsibility early  in college at 16 intelligent  first in his class  vicepresident of a company three years later  so hes ambitious driven maybe too much so  he has a heart condition  i know ive got his pills  hes very organized  no charities no  hes not generous with time or money anal  im guessing hes passiveaggressive control freak  so make him sweat it out for a little while  assume control and then behave erratically  yeah one more thing  a hunch really  people this tightly wound the threat of pain  can be more effective than pain itself  okay ive got it  this is all just guesswork  i could have done more with a little time  nina you did great  ill get back to you as soon as i can  okay  get up there now  this doesnt have to take long  its up to you  do you know a man named penticoff  how about alan york  david palmer  of course hes running for president  the attempt on his life has failed  the perpetrators will be in custody soon youve already been implicated  if you cooperate with me now i might be able to help you  i can only repeat i have no idea what youre talking about  your hands are sweating  of course im scared  who are you meeting on your way to the airport  a man named kevin carroll  who is he  hes a businessman like myself  he sells machine tools  why were you meeting him in a parking garage  it was his choice i dont know why  i told you everything i know  hey its me  run a background check on a kevin carroll  allegedly a machine tools salesman  probably an alias  yeah  let me show you something  you ever hear about the russian gulag  what  a string of prisons in northern siberia  russians didnt have a lot of hightech equipment up there  so they had to make do with what was around  sort of like what im doing right now  you probably dont think that i can force this towel down your throat  trust me i can all the way  except i hold on to this little bit here  when your stomach starts to digest it  i pull it out  taking your stomach lining with it  most people could take about a week to die  its very painful  what kind of man are you  i dont want to hurt you  but i will do everything i have to do to protect my family  i want to show you something  its in my wallet  open it please  i know you want to see your family again and i want to see mine  more than anything in the world  mr bauer believe me if i knew something that would help you  i would tell you  mr drazen   found bauer  no  but were doing everything possible scanning police frequencies  checking hospitals  and im still expecting to hear from my contact inside the ctu  and if bauer comes here as you suggested earlier  then well be ready for him  for an american operation we thought we needed an american crew  perhaps we undervalued our own capabilities   im pulling the plug on you  you cant tell me  you were supposed to frame bauer for david palmers assassination  but palmers still alive  you dont even know where bauer is correct   no but i  youve failed  for over a year now youve been saying how important this is  now youre just gonna quit  quit  of course not  we have a contingency plan  bauer and palmer will both be dead by the end of the day  you never said anything to me about a contingency plan  it doesnt involve you  just give me a little more time to find bauer  untiltil noon  thats not even two hours  ill give you 30 minutes  if you dont find bauer by then i take over  your last task will be to kill his wife and daughter and pull your people out  i like your education program but with all due respect  i do have one or two suggestions  well thats why im here  im not one to say that teachers shouldnt  be accountable for their performance but  would you excuse me for just a moment  sure  carl  hello david  since you fired me from your staff i assume this is a social call  i need to talk to you in person  why is that  i got a very disturbing call today a little while ago  oh  i was told that george ferragamos life may be in danger  who told you that frank ames  you know what an old lady he is just dont pay any attention to him  i need to talk to you now  its a pretty busy day for me david  i know a few things about you carl  things you dont want spread around  are you threatening me  is that what its come to after all these years  its come to whatever it takes to get you over here now  where are you  grant elementary in the valley  ill be there by 1100   nina myers  hey its me  you got anything on kevin carroll yet  yeah i show six kevin carrolls  one does in fact work for a machine tool company  its a cover its gotta be  theres another possibility  maybe hes the wrong ted cofell  no he was implicated in jameys file along with gaines  that file was partially erased  we cant rely on its information  i think youre making a mistake  theres something about this guy this is not a mistake  jack i know you think hes all youve got but maybe thats affecting your judgment  okay thanks  were going to see your friend kevin carroll  it looks like theyre getting ready to leave  mom whats wrong  its nothing honey im all right  will you stop saying that youre not all right   what did he do to you  nothing  ive been having this pain in my stomach  how bad  it comes and goes  i can manage   i should go tell somebody  no   mom you need help  i said no  your father is coming until then we have to be strong  okay  thank you  hows the food  oh better than what we used to eat  you two went to the same elementary school  oh weve known each other all our lives  and still as much in love as ever   thank you so much  youre welcome  i am due at another school but its been wonderful to meet you  and all those great kids  thank you   would you excuse us a second  of course  i need to know if youve talked to carl since i fired him  yes i have  what did you talk about  i asked him if he could find a way to stop maureen kingsley  from airing the story about keith he said he would  what did he say exactly  as near as i can remember something about  taking care of the evidence against keith  and you didnt think  that was worth mentioning to me  i wasnt sure what he meant david  im trying to believe that when you deceived me seven years ago  it was a onetime thing  this isnt making it any easier  that is so unfair  see you later  i dont know if its important but you asked me to check  on jack bauer the guy at breakfast  yes what did you find  typical agency file a lot of gaps classified  was one of those gaps  in the summer about two years ago   howd you know  well get into that later  right now weve got other things to deal with  move up to the other seat  now  an average businessman with a microtech halo in his car  what did you just say  say it again  or ill break your other wrist  this is not cofell  you speak serbian  what are you from belgrade  you got family there  you deserve everything thats happening to you  what do you know about whats happening to me

these days you have to be surrogate parents  as well as teachers  what can be done about that at the federal level  thats a good question  one that mike has become an expert on in the last few years  havent you mike  ive been in charge of preparing our position paper on education  and ive reached some conclusions i think youll find interesting  wonderful  studies have proven that parental involvement  whats this about ferragamo  what difference does it make as long as youre protected  what difference does it make that someone may be murdered  i didnt say anything about murder  you didnt deny it either  okay i deny it satisfied  david  power has a price and that price has to be paid always  spare me the civics lesson  i will not permit anyone to be harmed in any way in the name of my candidacy  you dont permit or not permit anything  dont you understand that by now  these are very serious people david  they didnt put all this time and money behind you  to let things fall
