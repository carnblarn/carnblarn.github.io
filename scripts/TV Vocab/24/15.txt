talking about  kosovo   kosovo  l know you hold me responsible  for the men you lost there two years ago today   you know about operation nightfall  l authorised the mission  l know you took out victor drazen and his inner circle and lost six men in the process   and you think l want revenge  yes l do  with all due respect l almost died today trying to protect you  and if l blame anyone for the death of my men in kosovo l blame myself   what were you doin at the power plant  l was trying to  the reason l went for that agents gun sir  was to try and get you out of the room without giving myself away  the people that want you dead had kidnapped my family  they threatened to kill them if l didnt assist them in the assassination attempt  they didnt tell you any of this when you came in did they sir  no  lts the truth you can verify it with chapelle   ok theyre just arriving at the safe house  man copy that show visual  this way mrs bauer  these are agents paulson and breeher theyve worked with jack for many years   this is jacks wife teri and daughter kim  kim hi  hi kim where do you want us  one in and one out  well its not exactly home but its relatively comfortable  there are motion detectors every ten yards   how long do we have to stay here  well worry about that after we debrief you   nina wheres the bathroom  theres one in each bedroom through there  lf youd both like to clean up before we get started please do  l was the head of the special defense appropriations committee in the senate  which is just a euphemism for covert operations  three years ago the cla brought to my attention  atrocities committed by victor drazen in kosovo  massacres torture ethnic cleansing  the man was a monster and was gaining support  l tried to go through the usual channels but l couldnt get anyone to work quickly enough  so l contacted the one person l knew who could get the job done  have him terminated off the books   and that would be robert ellis  thats right  ellis was funded through a discretionary fund of my committee  his job was to implement the covert missions and see to it that no names were leaked  now were both on somebodys list  so this is payback for what happened that day  lts the only thing that makes sense  but if someone could put your name and my name on a list together  that means they should be able to find robert ellis too  youre right  four sixes  lets see em  l knew it l saw it in your eyes  lf you could read whats in my eyes youd crawl under a rock and cry  go again  phone rings   ellis  bobby its david palmer   you gotta be kidding  lm not lm here with jack bauer  get lost  what are you doin with bauer l went to a lot of trouble to make sure you two never met  someone close to victor drazen seems to have connected us   explain  someone wants me dead  and it appears they want bauer too today  the twoyear anniversary of nightfall  lm the only one who knows you both were involved  apparently not and if were on the list its likely you are too   let me talk to bauer  lm right here bob   jack you still at ctu  yeah  to source this we need each others help  unfortunately over the last 12 hours lve had to cut a few corners  lm being investigated right now my hands are tied  well get them untied david can help you there  lt has to be someone either connected to your team  no no one on my team knew of the senators involvement  well then it has to be drazens group  lll retrieve the closed file on nightfall ltll contain the names of drazens associates  thatll take a few minutes meantime you need to pick up a trail on the money  odds are its funded through belgium can you get to your k3 accounts from there   yes if l get reinstated  all right start there  well compare names when we talk again where can l reach you  ctu los angeles office  all right  knock at door  nina teri   yes  l put some clean clothes on the bed  thank you  they called me and said you decided not to fly out arent we going to

terrifies me  well it does  mom  lm sorry  ellis are there any other names on the hk list thatyou recognise   rich goen michael redman thats it  no they werent cleared until after the op   lll use

us escape lll tell them that  no  dont tell them anything about me  well its too late my moms already being questioned theyre gonna ask about you  lm next l cant lie  ok dont  tell them that l didnt know anything about what was goin on  and that dan threatened me he had a gun  ok but promise me youll turn yourself in  l gotta think this through lm not like you kim l dont come from a good family   systems not gonna give me a break  lts your only way out of this rick  l brought you to gaines thats kidnapping  they could put me in jail for the rest of my life  whats incredible is that none of this has anything to do with me running for president  lt has nothing to do with the primary  lt has nothing to do with my being black  lts just revenge for taking out victor drazen  yes sir  phone rings   hello  david its sherry   oh hi are you back at the hotel  yes where are you  lm at ctu a government agency  why   theres some things l have to take care of  david whats going on  lm trying to find out whos attempting to kill me sherry   lve got to go wait for me at the hotel ok  ok  bye  just doesnt stop  lm sorry this is happening to you sir  youve been detained  your familys been kidnapped  and youre concerned about me  that didnt have anything to do with the election that was about my son  ls he ok  l just realised today  that l havent always been there for him  and whats killing me  is that hes always been there for me  being the son of a politician isnt easy  being a son or a daughter  or a father  none of its easy  your wife and daughter ok  l dont know  l hope so   ok just try to be relaxed  ok  l just have a few questions  this just came in from ellis l organised it into three sections  crossreferences are in the first part then theres a summary of operation nightfall  details that may not be important are at the end   any word on the missing file  no not yet  ok thanks milo  what is the ambassador to libya doing on this list  probably kept drazens money separate from the government  weve had our eye on him for quite some time  do you know a rene bonniere   no whos he  hes out of north africa  a couple highups over at district thought he was trying to set up terrorist cells in the us  jack page four  second paragraph down  drazens wife and daughter were in the bunker  did you know about this this wasnt in our initial report  they died in the explosion  my god  this is an eye for an eye we took out drazen and his family  now someone wants mine  whos in charge of protecting your family  jack who has the authority to add security to your wife and daughter  chapelle   woman yes senator  send in mr chapelle right away  yes sir  there was nothing else you saw or heard that gave you a glimpse into their operation  no thats it they really didnt talk much in front of us   tell me about this boy rick he helped you  yeah  how  well different ways but mainly he gave us a gun and he helped us escape   howd he get a gun  l dont know   and you dont know his last name  no   l dont think kimberly knows either  how did she meet him  through her friend janet york  everyone used to say wait until shes a teenager  youll finally understand the meaning of the word worry  lm sure shell grow out of it jack says shes basically a levelheaded kid  jack talks about kim  just the usual stuff  lt surprises me jacks work always seems so serious and secretive  lts hard to picture him sitting around the office talking about his family  sometimes at lunch hell bring up something if somethings on his mind  so do you think rick had the confidence of lra gaines the leader of the group  l really couldnt tell you that   nina could l ask you a question  sure  when jack and l were separated  did he ever talk about me  jack never discussed his marriage  oh  sometimes he would talk about kim  you know  we all knew he was going through a very hard time  and that he missed you both very much  when jack and l got back together again he told me that hed been with someone else  l told him it didnt matter what l did what he did when we were apart   that was in the past the only thing that mattered was what we did from that point on  lt was you wasnt it  teri  l saw it when we got off the helicopter  l saw it when you looked at him  after you were separated  yes we saw each other  but it didnt last long he realised it was a mistake and he went back to you   what about you  what about me  did you think it was a mistake   are you still sleeping with him  no  teri  it was over before he went back to you that is the truth  look l realise this is a terrible time for you to discover all this  when do you think a good time would be nina  lm sorry  lts just we have to get through the rest of this  l need to take a break  yeah mike l know well be leaving in about five minutes  l cant wait for ellis lve got to go  senator theyre not gonna let me continue to work here l am technically still under arrest  come on  ryan   yes senator  l understand you have jack under arrest  l told the senator l was being detained  there is an ongoing crisis that supersedes any charges that might be filed against him   but senator  l want him reinstated immediately  sir you dont have the authority to make that decision  alberta please  sir what you are asking isnt possible the charges against agent bauer are serious  wed be in contempt of agency regulations if we reinstated him without a hearing  ryan you dont have to reinstate me not permanently  nobody here has as much information about this situation as l do  give me provisional status till the end of the day  then you can take me back into custody do whatever you want  fine jack  you work the case out of ctu but you answer to me  good luck with your campaign senator  thank you  walk with me  secret service wants me to leave the state they say its not safe  well l agree with them  the one thing we know is that drazens people are here and they want us today  and its almost three oclock now the day is more than half over  lm going to stay  lets flush them out into the open and deal with them  otherwise you and l and our families  will be looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives  l understand lll follow up with ellis lll keep you posted   you know how to get in touch with me  jack  lm sorry that l misjudged you  thank you senator  excuse me  before my mom came nobody talked to me they put me in the room l was locked in   what about rick  rick what about rick   well he was one of your kidnappers right  not exactly  l thought he and dan brought you to gaines  well it was mostly dan l mean not rick  l think he was actually just as surprised as we were about what was happening  really  well yeah he was fighting with dan the entire time  he actually helped us escape  hold on lets not get ahead of ourselves  phone rings  hold on   myers  hey its me  chapelle reinstated me to provisional status for the rest of the day at palmers request   thats great jack  yeah hows everything going over there   not bad  look were sending over two more teams   why  looks like teri and kim were targets as well  nina this is not information they need to know ok   no of course  good thanks   let me speak to teri ok  sure  teri  lts jack   hi jack  hey sweetheart you ok how you doin  lm ok   hows kim  shes fine  tony gave me a message that you wanted to tell me something important  no its nothing important  are you sure you sound funny  lts nothing l just  l just  lm so tired  why dont you try and get some rest sweetheart  listen if if you need

thing the more lm convinced the file was taken out deliberately  which leads me to believe it contains what were lookin for  can you give an estimate of when you think the file was stolen  also a list of people you think couldve had access to even get in there  not yet but you tell milo l got some ideas on how to  urgh  bob  bob  bob  can you hear me  bob
