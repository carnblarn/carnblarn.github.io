hour in the meantime lets find armus  yes sir  sherry i owe you an apology  why what did mike say to you  richard armus was the one who let wieland go  but armus doesnt have his own agenda he must be working for someone else  were looking into it now  im sorry i jumped to the wrong conclusion  its all right  i dont expect you to change your attitude towards me overnight  apology accepted  david  what are you gonna do  talk to the press  im not sure how but i may have to go after rons credibility   rons credibility  yes  make it look like his report was motivated  by personal dislike that its not based in fact  yes but it is based in fact   believe me i wish there was another way  maybe there is  why dont you just tell the truth david its what you do best  i mean you pulled it off with keith with our divorce  youve earned the publics trust just use it  what  im just wondering if youve really changed  or if youve just gotten better at pretending   sir  yes what is it  we just got

if she made it  find her  im gonna find her you gotta hang in there  hang in there search and rescue will be here any minute  just hang in there ill be right back  come on come on  these images were taken around the time the pilot reported the explosion   they were shot down  by some kind of groundtoair missile  compile a list of anybody that might have had access to their flight plan  if nina didnt die in the crash whoever it was will want to finish the job  i have search and rescue scrambling now  make sure theyre well armed get me their eta as soon as you have it  george richards told me you had warner and naiyeer transferred to room seven   thats right  i separated them for a reason  its not working so lets put them together and play them off each other  one minute youre trying to save your own ass  then you act like you give a damn about anybody   back off  no im not gonna back off  not today now whats going on  remember the warehouse in panorama city  weaponsgrade plutonium airborne in the fire fight   you were exposed  yeah  said id be lucky if i made it through tomorrow  i dont know what to say george  im sorry  me too  does anybody else know about this  just jack you can we keep it that way  do you need anything is there something i can do  just do you job let me do mine  so you both claim not to know syed ali   its not a claim its the truth  sit down   id rather stand  sit down  where the hell do you think you are wake up  a cache of weaponsgrade plutonium was found in a warehouse in panorama city  a nuclear weapon was assembled there and its set to be detonated today  a nuclear bomb  we also found this in the warehouse what do you make of that guys  this is a bill of lading from our company  for a container sent to syed ali  which means at least one of you is lying right now  ill let you two work that out between yourselves  whoever talks first gets immunity  its a onetime offer it expires in ten minutes   theyre gonna come for us soon  whats taking them so long  i dont know but theyll be here   were leaving soon  where are we going   central booking  lapd thats downtown   i know where it is  aw man  what did i tell you i dont believe this  someone from ctu is supposed to pick us up can you call george mason  captain says its out of their jurisdiction  look youre both suspects in a capital crime   we told you why we cant go back to la  the bomb   yes  i checked it  theres been no departmental alert or elevated threat status  they do not want the entire city to panic at once  do you think were making this up call ctu theyll tell you  im a cop i have my orders ok  ill sign you two out before i take you back to the city   i dont believe this we cant go back to la  when my dad finds out hell fix things  we shouldnt be counting on your father  no offence but you were right when you said how messed up he is  everything ive said about my father is because i was angry  and i blamed him for what happened to my mom   maybe you were right  no  no listen it wasnt his fault and he did the best he could  it just all turned out wrong  no this is crazy  how can they keep us here without letting us see a lawyer  huh   what are we gonna do  nothing  because nothing we say will make any difference  theyll make it look like were involved  with a nuclear bomb ive done nothing wrong this is crazy i have nothing to hide   what about you bob  what about me   you got anything to hide  of course not no  you made the authorisation to ali   no i didnt  then who did  dont interrogate me thats exactly what they want  yeah im not asking for them  lf you didnt make the authorisation  naiyeers levels are even warners spiking all over  they also said that you work for the cia  i let the cia pass information through our distribution network a couple of times   thats it  why didnt you tell me   because it is none of your concern  i think it concerns me now  i think a nuclear bomb pretty much concerns everyone dont you  you know what im thinking bob  im thinking that all your generosity  and acceptance is just a load of crap  reza you better sit down and shut up  before you say something you will regret for the rest of your life  you lied to me  i can track the shipping order  bobs code signature will show that he authorised the transaction order   get off of me  no just stop it  the database is at the office ill take you there  step outside   im not taking the fall for you bob  come on take it easy  all right all right   hey wheres george  with naiyeer he broke  could you tell him the search and rescue is about 12 minutes from the crash site  ok   tony  yeah   whats going on with george  as far as what  hes sick isnt he  hes got some kind of radiation poisoning doesnt he  whered you get that  hazmats all over the warehouse he raided this morning so its gotta be hot  his nose was bleeding and shipler told me he was throwing up in the bathroom  and it doesnt take a doctor to figure it out  besides i can read your face pretty well by now  look he doesnt want anybody else to know ok   how bad  pretty bad  can he run things in his condition   yeah i think so  thats not good enough  lf hes compromised mentally or physically we cant  he can do his job michelle  he wants to do his job like ive never seen hes determined to stop this bomb  so am l which is why i think he should step down  ill keep an eye on him and the second he misses a step ill make sure he backs off   no you cant babysit him  im not babysitting him michelle  now you gotta trust me on this  can i see that information as soon as you get it  i made some notes on davids speech  i thought maybe you might want to incorporate them  i havent even shown that to the president yet   jenny showed me a draft  she shouldnt have  shes known me for a long time lynne she knows what i have to offer  mrs palmer the president believes  that you can be an asset to him during this time of crisis  thats why youre here he did not give you licence to insinuate yourself into  wait wait wait put your back down lynne  i am not here to trespass on your territory i am here to help  thats why im coming to you first before i go directly to david  mrs palmer that sounds like a threat to me  unless davids speech is pitchperfect which it is not  wielands allegations might bring down this presidency  i dont need you to tell me how important this is  then you owe it to david to look at my revisions  give me your hand  come on  we got a survivor here  this doesnt look like search and rescue   who are they are they coming for you  i dont

in the city  im not gonna need a lawyer but your father might  i dont understand  reza whats going on  its your father marie  they think that he might have something to do with syed ali  my father   yeah he tried to use me  used you how  to do business with ali who they say is part of this terrorist group   my father part of a terrorist group  they have proof  they have this transaction thats connecting one of us to ali  and i know i didnt write it  im sorry to put you in this impossible situation  i love you and i wanna be with you  but right now something really bad might happen if i dont help them  after everything hes done for you to turn on my father  he turned on me he turned on us  what else was i supposed to do  marie   come on lets go  marie  we have a secured line ready  thats nina myers  mike you should talk to her first  i dont want to give her access to me until she gives us something in return  miss myers this is mike novick im the presidents chief of staff   i asked to speak with the president  hes not available  do you wanna stop this nuclear bomb or not   of course we do  then put the president on  im authorised to negotiate on his behalf  what i want is nonnegotiable  what do you want  ill tell you where the bomb is in exchange for immunity  the presidents already granted you a total pardon  except this is a crime i havent committed yet  what crime  the murder of jack bauer  add that to my pardon and ill tell you where the bomb is  and if we dont comply  we dont have a choice   is that you mr bauer  yes  please tell the president that he has no other choice but to accept her deal   is ctu on a secured line  yes this is george mason  were on a designated channel except michelle dessler and tony almeida  do you have alternatives to what shes asking  any weaknesses that we can exploit  none shes a survivor sir she knows bauer  she knows if she doesnt kill him now hell hunt her down and find her later  so in your assessment nina myers is our best chance to stop this bomb  sir she may be our only chance   ms myers this is president palmer  im listening   is jack bauer there  yes mr president im here too  ms myers if the information you provide  culminates in the successful interception of the nuclear device  you will get everything you asked for  you will be pardoned in advance for the murder of jack bauer  i can live with that  start talking nina  the bomb will be detonated by a man named syed ali  we know about ali we need to know where he is  hes at a house in chatsworth on starling court   contact the local law enforcement to set up a perimeter  coordinate among the relevant agencies  ms myers youre not to take any action until we put our hands on this bomb  agreed   jack  yes sir  is there anything you want me to do  please make sure that my daughter is safe sir   tell her that i love her  ill do that  thank you mr president   jack  mr president  please you dont need to say anything sir  there was only one right choice to make and you made it  im sorry jack  hes right mr president  its the only way were going to find this nuclear device  before its too late  sir  the press corps is waiting   youve made some changes  yes sir   its better  thank you sir  for gods sake stop it  what do you want i dont know what you want  yes you do  we didnt see anything we didnt tell anyone anything  i swear i dont know anything how can i tell you what i dont know  i believe you  if she knew anything she would have told us kill her  it wont take them long to find ali  this isnt how you thought it would end is it jack  this isnt over yet
