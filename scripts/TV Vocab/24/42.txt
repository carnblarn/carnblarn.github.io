three in the building adjacent  i just got off with the secretary of defence  he wants to know how much longer youll give jack bauer to disprove that tape  before we failsafe the orders  jack bauer will have up until the time the planes start releasing bombs  from the secretarys point of view thats tying the dods hands  the longer it takes for your decision the less flexibility he has  and he may want to launch a prestrike  there will be no prestrikes on this mission  were gonna utilise every moment we have to be thorough   he wont like that  thats his problem  i understand  sir theres a situation that requires your immediate attention  what mike  civil unrest is starting to tip up and down the east coast  the area im most concerned about is outside of atlanta  whats going on there  some ad hoc militias have joined forces  and theyre getting very aggressive in one of the suburbs   is this racially motivated  yes  the demographics of the area are predominantly middle eastern  what do you hope to accomplish here  we want washington to know we consider ourselves at war  we want these people interned and if they wont do it we will  who do you want interned most people in this neighbourhood are us citizens  they werent born here some of them dont speak english  they memorise answers to 50 questions take the test then we let them vote  how do you respond to claims that these people  have no more to do with the bomb than you or i  if wed locked down our borders 20 years ago none of this would have happened  whats eerie is even though the crowd has been here for half an hour  there are only a few police cars  why i thought we ordered the national guard  some are on their way some are at other flash points   want me to call the fbi and the army  and tell them what   theyve had their orders  the problem is resources  we just dont have enough bodies to cover everything  wheres the media heading right now  its happening all up and down the east coast  but this city marietta in atlanta seems to have the most traction with the press  all right this is what were gonna do  we may be short on manpower but it doesnt have to appear that way  send all the eastern georgia national guard to marietta  and tell the media that this is where somethings going to happen  whats going to happen sir  if this is what the people are going to be watching  lets show them how were going to respond  i want them to see how we protect our citizens  we will not put up with racism or xenophobia  if this is where its gonna start this is where its gonna stop  all right im all set up here  start laying down the smoke were ready to go  copy that go in on the smoke  you take the men on the left i got the ones right above us you ready  smokes in place ill draw fire and go pick up the vehicle  go   kate  jack  kate get down  kate come on we gotta keep going  keep moving  get in the front seat and stay down  get down  stay down go go go  let me look at it  no exit wound we gotta get you to a hospital   no lax cargo departures  you will not make it  ill make it just stop the bleeding  kate in the glove box theres a firstaid kit get me all the gauze pads and wraps  hold on hold on  put pressure on it now  its a surreal scene in marietta  its 430am and normally people would be at home asleep  yet today a showdown is in the making the riots have escalated all over the city  fires and looting are reported to be widespread  the national guard continue to roll in as do the angry citizens  who are taking out their frustration on this peaceful middle eastern community  you got what you asked for its on all the news channels  manski of the national guard wants to know what tactical ruleset you wanna follow   what are they on now  containment only  unacceptable i want the law enforced  tell him to start making arrests and taking people in  sir if you declare a curfew you can start pulling every one of them in   before this thing gets out of control  that a good idea do it   tell him were not afraid to take action  yes sir  what will help more than anything sir is your voice  you need to talk directly to the people  i know  tell jenny ill be down in a few minutes   murphy speaking  this is novick i need jenny dodge   carrie  yeah  lapd said there was automaticweapon fire in studio city  police are finding bodies and militaryspec weapons  we got the address check it against what michelle pulled off the satellite  right away  is that the location michelle huh is it  the police just got there they already got four bodies so lets talk   yeah thats it  we gotta call him he may need our help  jack made it clear that the only way to get proof is if ctu stays out of it  we dont even know if hes still alive  hes on an open channel you wont be able to trace it but you can talk to him   michelle  no jack its tony  tony trust me stay out of this   whats going on  the president asked me for proof  that the cyprus recording was fake im trying to do that  the man who can provide proof will only deal with me he wont cooperate with ctu   thats why i left in that way  how do we know hes not using you  cos ten commandos tried to kill him to stop him from making a deal with me   whats he want  he wants to disappear  well deal with him here  he will not cooperate with us under those circumstances  i understand but this countrys about to go to war over

the more comfortable the joint chiefs will be with it  my jobs not to make the joint chiefs comfortable  thank you thatll be all  yes sir  mr president theres been a development in marietta  the national guard took on a more aggressive posture at our request  but the disturbance got to be more than they could handle  what happened  two people were killed sir  the national guard started shooting rubber bullets and there were two fatal hits  one of the victims was a leader of the dissent and   and  and the other was a young boy sir  he was middle eastern and he was from one of the families that we were trying to protect  whats going on now  theyve made some arrests but the crowd is still unruly  now we might want to think about taking a step back  maybe the presence of the national guard is making matters worse  if we step back now those families are left completely unprotected  yeah  a young boy  what was his name  the boy   i dont know sir  the boy had a name find out  indeed i will sir  it was a tragic accident  tell the national guard to hold their ground  i want that neighbourhood protected i want order restored  yes sir  theres the bullet it missed the jugular
