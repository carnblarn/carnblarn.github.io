of you  abed guess whos got two thumbs  and has an exciting career opportunity for you  this guy  im pointing my thumbs at god  im using one thumb to say thats great  um i told my pastor about youtube  and how theres no light there for the kids  and our church wants to sponsor  the making of a viral video with a christian message  ha what are you gonna do rapping jesus  pierce please just step aside  and make room for a new generation  um abed would you like to make a christian youtube  i know youre muslim  as a muslim id be happy to do it  as a filmmaker no way  im a storyteller not a preacher  well the bible has been called the greatest story ever told  ben lyons said the same thing about i am legend  oh well ill have to rent that then   whoa  what  thats a lot of pasta for no veggies  youre not in charge of what i eat  thats true britta  and some damn broccoli please  pierce has been acting out a lot lately  maybe you should talk to him  how is that my job  arent you like the dad  would the dad walk away from this conversation  no  ah  youre having cookies for lunch   yeah  hey you didnt pay for those  call a cop  heads up gay wads   hey  cookies    what are you looking at  your face  thats what youre supposed to look at  so  so you gonna sit down or what  oh no i usually sit with the younger people  well la de da de da  no no we watch videos on youtune  and you guys probably dont even know what that is  we dont care  pierce are you looking for us  were sitting over there i can see  sheesh did you take your pills   ooh  mamas boy  were having a private conversation here  oh oh im sorry um hi  im im britta pierces pbbt  very nice meeting you guys  very nice meeting you guys  shes a lesbian   shirley  hmm   i read the new testament  the whole thing  you know being raised by tv and movies  i always thought that jesus just walked on water  and told people not to have abortions  but its so much cooler than that  he was like et edward scissorhands and marty mcfly combined  i would love to make a jesus movie  oh abed thats wonderful  what do you think we should do  it needs to be cool and addictive  like that video of the kitten falling asleep  absolutely  but the storys been told to death  so i want to approach it in a new way  we need a jesus movie for the post postmodern world  like jesus as a rapper  no  i want to tell the story of jesus  from the perspective of a filmmaker exploring the life of jesus  that sounds very appealing to filmmakers  see in the filmmakers film jesus is a filmmaker  trying to find god with his camera  but then the filmmaker realizes that hes actually jesus  and hes being filmed by gods camera  and it goes like that forever in both directions  like a mirror in a mirror  because all of the filmmakers are jesus  and all their cameras are god and the movie is called abed  all caps  filmmaking beyond film a metafilm  my masterpiece   but i dont like it  well thats okay  you know youre reacting the way the world did to jesus  im reacting the way the world does  to movies about making movies about making movies  i mean come on charlie kaufman  some of us have work in the morning damn  does this mean you dont want to work on the movie  this means there is no movie  this is the movie  the game is jacks and deuces wild  except if the dean comes in and then its bingo  keep it ive got another one  if

dopey  do the line atheist  jesus did you really die for our sins  thats dope  you think thats dope  check out these beatitudes  blessed be the peacemakers word to the meek  the kingdom of heaven is open all week jesus and me were oh  i have arrived  i am watched as i am watching  i am audience and creation  the earth shall know my power  abed what are you doing  oh great you blew the take  no no

father has already bought the popcorn  whoa  excuse me abed but you arent actually trying to say  that youre jesus are you  i am who you say i am  oh man  okay yeah ooh its meta now  except heres the thing  im a devout christian and you guys  are feeding into this poor boys delusions  so cool shes atual real life pharisee  hey bitch why dont you go back to your temple  yeah  why dont you all stop confusing jesus  with an egotistical filmmaking lunatic  i forgive her  so hows your film going abed  blasphemously  its not blasphemy to say that we are god shirley  first corinthians  he who unites himself with the lord is one with him in spirit  did you just scripture me muslim  jesus was jewish  are you ever gonna let that go  hey no religious talk  somebodys late  what is that in your pocket  jeff britta pierce is smoking cigars  whats it to you buttbreath  look at your eyes  have you been out all night with those hipsters  hipsters  that pack of old people that hang out in the cafeteria

to the greatest film ever made  and on the seventh day shirley shut down production  abed shirley has informed me  that you are using school equipment  on school property to make a religious film  she has filed an official complaint  invoking the separation of church and state  i pointed out the irony to her already  dont give a crap lets be ironic  shut it down  okay  abed are you making a religious film  all movies are religious to me  nice but is it a movie about jesus  is the matrix is robocop  is superman returns  all stories are about death and resurrection  ive got one wrath of khan hmm  thats a good one  spock sacrifices himself for the crew and gets reborn  how captivating was ricardo montalban in that  except in abeds film the characters name isnt spock  thats true its abed  oh im getting creative goose bumps here  i love charlie kaufman  i need to run into editing for one second  but if you want we can grab you a chair  and you can watch a take  i would love that  ive never watched a take before  this is exciting  uh you  say what you will about abed but the man cannot be killed  i mean its almost like hes jesus  i got it  i dont think we should be driving  i mean were all you know old and groggy  god stop worrying  richard flew zeroes during the big one  what do you mean flew zeroes  hes not japanese  well what did you fly during the big one rich  where

the story the story is us  we are the film  so what do you think  i need to take a walk  dear god my movie is the worst piece of crap  i have ever seen in my entire life  how could i have been so blind  its a selfindulgent adolescent mess  i can barely sit through it  and now with all this hype  ive got a real snakes on a plane brewing  the critics are gonna crucify me  my career will be over before it begins  god if youre out there i know i dont deserve it  but i need your help  please take this project away from me  make it rain send a meteor  anything please  now  okay i get it this is what i deserve  ill finish it up  hi im pierce hawthornes emergency contact   youre here to pick him up  no no  im here to be removed as his emergency contact   one second  hey i got a class  where is everybody  is anyone coming to get leonard  no nobody comes for him anymore  his kids asked us to stop calling them  why do you think he acts like that  so were in prison right  all right bring him out  over here pierce come on book  hey  go wait in the car  it wasnt my fault  go wait in the car  ooh  you want me to change that or not  i guess not  uh but um could you do me a favor  could you add britta perry as a contact  perry  and would you give her a call a couple of times a week  she gets pretty worried about him  and uh she works days so make sure you call at night  everyone thinks what you did was destined to happen  that it was proof that god was making my movie  a movie so good it could never exist  they think im a genius and they think youre a villain  you heard me praying  i dont know what you mean  oh this is gonna be good  abed sent me a new link and that man knows his video virality  so youre just gonna drop all pretense of actually teaching us  yeah here we go  blessed be the peacemakers word to the meek  the kingdom of heaven is open all week  you finished my movie  i dont know what you mean  you humble me  you humble me too  okay open your books because abed has broken the internet   great  so which one of us is gonna head home and change  hilarious  so you guys bought one of my outfits  and then staked out my apartment every day until i wore it
