bad news for the older people as well  senor chang is no longer with us  um hes not faking his death again is he  because i cant handle that roller coaster  first hes alive and then were happy  and then hes alive again and  i received an anonymous tip  that chang had misrepresented certain aspects  of his qualifications for instance having them  word of advice if an asian man says hes a spanish teacher  its not racist to ask for proof okay  you ignore your mothers voice  and get right into that horses mouth  so if changs a fraud what about our grades  are they invalid oh no no no no  thats not fair to you guys  im sure youve all worked very hard and learned  so just take your final with changs replacement  doctor      buenos dias students buenos dias  soy doctora escodera    students si

plumber     hey  hi  okay so we know three kinds of verbs  which took 40 minutes  at this rate if we dont sleep or pee  we can cover about 10 of the exam   and if its multiplechoice  will be right  actually thats a lot of right answers  when youre guessing almost everything  i dont want to sound like a defeatist  but were defeated   face it  why even take the exam  were all gonna be retaking spanish this fall   hmm  what was that   what was what  i dont know  i said retake spanish and everyone went ugh  and you went hmm  maybe its one of those recessive genes  i can also curl my tongue who else  oh   annie ratted out chang    what  you made this happen because youre obsessed  with all of us being together next year  i wouldnt say i was obsessed  permission to treat the witness as hostile  ill allow it  did you record yesterdays spanish class   i dont think so  abed  you said you record all your classes  pierce called it a spoiler alert  you heard chang tell me he was bogus  and then dropped the dime because you would do anything  to keep this group together  because you are insecure  because you didnt get hot until after high school  thats true   fine i did it  for real annie  oh annie  someone make her a dude so i can punch her  go ahead and hate me  its better than what was going to happen  we were all gonna drift apart and you were all too cool  to do anything  maybe not too cool  maybe just you know not psycho enough   yeah a little crazy  youre a psycho    now she is going to make the disney face  her lip is gonna quiver and her eyes will flutter  but they wont ever actually close  but do not feel sorry for her  she stole a year of our lives and were right to be pissed   oh annie  no no  everyone close their eyes do it close them  abed close oh dont

all the time  thats what my rehab group used to say  the only one that keeps in touch is the guy that sells jewelry  made out of bottle caps  i had hoped that this group would amount  to more than passing hellos and whatever the hell this is    nobody even think about going after her  thats what she wants  more personal drama so we fail the exam  and stay in spanish forever  we have to beat her dont text her dont call her  dont mention her we do not need her to study  does anybody know how to study   annie usually  whose side are you on  happy finals week greendale  continuing our
