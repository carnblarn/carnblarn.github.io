night  someone murdered a partially clothed animal  and threw a human corpse out a window  and you can thank the person that did it  a person that may be in this room  for the fact that from now on  april fools day is banished okay  at greendale april 1st  is officially march 32nd forever  how do you know it was one of us  well if i may answer a question with a question  why are you dressed like a wizard  okay is he having a stroke  ill tell you how i know  security officers bennett and edison  found this at the scene hmm  this little hat says chang on it  and we ruled out your teacher  because he has a crippling fear of frogs  i told you that in confidence  how about whoever did this just fesses up  all right that wasnt just a cadaver  that was thrown out that window  it was a person  with family and friends  and for every day that nobody confesses  this class will be meeting one of them hmm  glenda oh i apologize  can you come on in here hmm  yes  and tell us about your

brittas a buzz kill mythology  well the toe tag fits britta  i mean you singlehandedly killed an entire schools buzz  not to mention a frog  and according to glenda cadaver harry  had 13 nieces and nephews  that im not interested in meeting  so you better think about coming clean  or im just gonna tell everybody you did it   starburns doesnt do very much  i guess fascinating people  dont resort to growing shapes on their faces  he makes one false move and im gonna go shirley on him  thats what my high school friends called crazy  yeah are you gonna go shirlier than i did  when i got addicted to pills  why are you so concerned with being a badass  maybe im tired of everyone thinking of me as a little girl  maybe i wanna be in charge of how im defined  well how do you think i feel  you have

you the rest of these chocolatecovered raisins  if you save my seat  i dont want you to feel judged by this  but your handling of this job has disappointed me  i mean your highspeed pursuit  caused 78 dollars worth of damages  and you didnt even get a statement out of mr winger   he got away  he ran between two poles  well i see how that would be frustrating   but the fact is  your ass is on the line  my ass is on the line  you just got off the phone with the mayor  i just got off the phone with the  what the mayor stop doing that  im trying to help youre not doing this right  well maybe you should do it  im sick and tired  of making excuses for you two  youre an embarrassment to the department  youre off the case and off the force  your badges your windbreakers now  now i aint got all

scheduled study group  jeff ahem lets just do this the easy way  confess  brittas the one who threw that body out the window  and i can prove it  how  britta was going to put a frog  wearing a sombrero on changs desk  because thats the kind of thing  she thinks is funny  dont you britta  no  then why is there a photo on your facebook page  of a cat wearing a necktie  pff its my cat  and the

wanted to be funny  knock knock  whos there  cancer  oh good come on in  i thought it was britta  wellbritta  i actually want to be taken more seriously  the only reason i slammed jeffs head against the table  was because i wanted to feel like an adult  like shirley  ohh  and i wanted to feel younger like annie  you know its not that im really old  cause people dont know how young i really am  see im doing it again  i hate that i obsess about my age  i know  i wish i was really magic  you know youre not  yeah  somebody must have sent these robes by accident  i only pretended i was level six
