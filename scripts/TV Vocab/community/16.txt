honest  but she lies to herself  shes seen the world but doesnt get it  she has more fights about stuff that doesnt matter  than a youtube comment section  shes passionate which i find stupid  but entertaining  attractive  there was only attraction at first  because she bothered to play hard to get   mm hmm  im happy with michelle  yeah slater is low maintenance  mm the lowest  brittas irritating impossible unpredictable  and she didnt like you so it felt useless to like her  slater likes you how you are expects nothing from you  youre safe from change  and passion   watch it  watch

and hanging up  when you realized i wasnt britta  i guess not  michelle  michelle um  i was trying to call britain to order you toffees  now that may sound dumb  but i needed to open with it  to make the truth less ridiculous  you see two nights ago britta drunk dialed me  and it embarrassed her and made her sad  and the only way for her to get her power back  was for me to get believably drunk  and leave her an equally embarrassing message  it sure seems like you and britta are friends  the way my moms pool cleaner was my uncle  have you had sex with her not even a little  what doesnt make sense is that you did  all this work to put a smile on her face  but you cant pick up ice cream for law  order night  because it feels too marriagey  first of all chubby hubby  i mean could you pick a
