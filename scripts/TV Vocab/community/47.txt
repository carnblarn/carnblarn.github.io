 no way  there are lunch trucks with 18 different nationalities  of food  you know what not different equal equal to whites  you know what better than whites  oh i think that sounds  like an awesome thing to do immediately  i bet the reader dean magazine would love it  im good  id like to stay here and check out  this unorthodox exam     shirley you okay  uhhuh  just a little indigestion  ive been having it all morning  are you sure it isnt contractions  no no no its way too early for any of that  um my other two came right on schedule  maybe even a little late  jordan was in here so long  he came out with a drivers license   im kidding thats not true ooh  chang babies are always premature  we gestate fast because were better at obtaining nutrients  some need only eight months  depending on how much of the mother they eat  oh uh shirley that is full of chemicals  i wouldnt expose your baby to that  actually my doctor said antacid is safe to take  yeah let me guess who paid for that study  big antacid  shirley chew on a eucalyptus root  andi know it sounds gross  pig saliva  its the same active ingredient as antacid  they just dress it up with a fancy name  how dare they

achieve or  uhuh no no no thank you for the conversation  i know what youre talking about  and even if it were true  thats not something a woman does  on her childs head   but  mmm  listen backseat birther  shirleys on her third kid  she doesnt need a thirdyearold slacker  with two oneeyed cats governing her body  first of all together my cats can do anything  secondly you disqualified yourself from this conversation  the moment you decided to grow a wang  i regret nothing  i feel sorry for the airhead  that youre gonna knock up at the age of 70  youre gonna be sitting in the waiting room  playing solitaire on your blackberry  while a life is created ten feet from you  oh and youre gonna squat in a babbling brook  and a beautiful star child is going to slide out  on a ray of sunshine while your cats each half watch  because youre so natural    ohoh okay oh boy  can someone please get every mop on campus  um did you break water is that broken water   thats broken water  chang baby

stupid handshake  a baby is coming out of shirleys vagina   two feet from us  dont worry  her contractions are still six minutes apart  so unless her cervix is dilated more than eight centimeters  we still have time to get her to a hospital  i delivered a baby earlier this year  in the back of an suv   what  hmmhmm  where was i when that happened  i dont know off in the background   did you pull your car up  uh no   its been overturned  what  okay look i dont want to alarm anyone  but the world food festival has taken a dark turn  i guess some national ethnicities  dont play nice with others  and things have turned into a bit of a race   kerfuffle  you mean riot  uh lets use kerfuffle for now okay mr winger  i was just trying to feed hungry foodies  im going to call an ambulance  oh theres ambulances out there  theyre overturning those too  i mean i didnt even know there was a difference  between north and south korean barbeque  i mean mash lasted longer than that war  get over it am i right dont print that  lets just quit jotting stop writing  okay 911 says its gonna take over an hour  because of a race kerfuffle  oh lake woebegone eeh  abed what do we do  shirley pretend im saying this  in a soothing reassuring nonrobotic voice  were not going to make it to the hospital  yes i am  im going to have this baby in a hospital  with my husband and the father of my baby  unless that father is me  in which case what you need to do now  is elevate your legs over your head  while facing the northeast corner of the room  but try not to look at the door okay  thats bad luck and chang babies are very superstitious  also if you can visualize a rabbit riding a dragon  itll increase his chances of winning lotteries     ben corner  listen shirley were having the baby right here right now    okay  okay  troy get every blanket and coat you can find  anything soft for shirley to lie on  annie i need you to call andre  and tell him to meet us here instead   well what can i do  stop
