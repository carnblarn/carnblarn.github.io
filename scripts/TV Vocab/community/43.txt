me watching dailies  but every once in a while it comes in handy  i dont understand why you would do this  and then try to pin it on lukka  now youre just ruining cool guys for fun  its just cruelty britta  youre inhuman youre an inhuman person  youre a monster  lukkas a monster for realsies  i did this so you guys would stop hanging out with him  hes a war criminal  youre embarrassing yourself britta  in what war is he a criminal  the battle for our affections  uh how about the genocide in the balkans  hmm yeah you would say that  you just got caught redhanded borrowing a dvd  without permission  you guys have to believe me  hes so much worse than tall kyle  hey jefe  hola  what are you doing who are these tiny people  i picked up shirleys kids from school  and im helping them with their spanish homework   hey kids  ooh  ow watch the cardigan  what why  to prove im a responsible dad  this proves youre a kidnapper   what the hells wrong with you  i am nuts jeff  get with the program  oh my god what have i done  i cant believe i actually said you could be a father   i can be  oh no you cant  you cant be anything and you never will  i pretended to have faith in you  to get you off my couch and out of my apartment  now call shirley and beg forgiveness  kids why dont you get your stuff together  ill take you home  whos shirley  shirleys your mom dumbass  our moms name is

anonymous tips about kidnappings  heres your wallet keys and pasties  theyre nipple guards for running  olympic athletes use them  buddy i worked at a maximumsecurity prison  for seven years  and those are still the gayest thing ive ever seen  well i find that hard to believe  jeffrey i spoke to the boys mother  shes not gonna press charges are you okay  oh im fine  i spent the night learning arts and crafts  from my cell mate chabo  did you know you can make an ashtray  using only a cigarette and a snitchs forehead  yeah  look uh shirley im  im sorry i tried to capitalize  on your situation with chang  apology accepted  punishment is time served  theres no cell on earth that can hold chang  i know this places secrets  winger thank god youre all right  ive been looking all hey tracy whats up baby  why are they arresting chang  i thought you said loquanda wasnt pressing charges  mmhmm not against jeff  but i talked her into going after chang  for child endangerment  shirley he could get three to five years for that  are you sure thats what you want  because if we put our heads together  we could be rid of him for 20 to life   really  oh absolutely  all id have to do is testify  that he tried to sell those kids to me  and throw in the fact that he was teaching them spanish  and any da worth his salt  can make a case for human trafficking  i like how you thinking  what is wrong with you two  why are you doing this to chang  andre im doing this for us  we have a second chance for our family  and i just want everything to be perfect  baby thats what you wanted the first time around  you did everything in your power to make everything perfect  and look what happened  are you trying to tell me you cheated  because i wanted what was best for our family  no i cheated because i was a coward  but you took me back because while i was gone  somehow you learned to accept the bad with the good  oh thats the greendale effect  our school motto is lower your standards  look look i know you are ashamed  about what happened with chang  hell i am too all right  but locking that little man up  is not gonna make our lives any less crazy  itll only make prison crazier  i guess youre right  its impossible to keep the chaos from your lives  i mean we learned that in that movie  we saw with all those dinosaurs   jurassic park  no its complicated  okay okay timeout  okay im sorry im sorry im sorry  im sorry to you you officer baby  come on  no no no  britta  what you guys want me to ruin something for you  come on youre being dramatic  we asked lukka a few questions after what you said  he told us about his time in the army  and  the things he did  im never gonna get some of those images out of my head  if i ever go to the balkans  im bringing some serious cheat codes and walkthroughs  why didnt you tell us sooner  because i didnt want to be the one  to ruin another guy for you guys  britta theres a difference between telling us  a guy likes nipple play  and telling us a guy makes hats out of babies  i guess the reason this happened  is because weve been riding you kind of hard lately  how about from now on we promise to go easier on you  if you promise not to tell us  any details about the guys youre dating  unless theyve committed genocide  or if theyre lefthanded  i want to know about that im making a chart  deal  i guess i ruined game night  i tend to ruin stuff   come on  you do not  you want to watch catfish with us  was that the movie where the guy flirts with the girl online  but then it turns out that its a fat old woman  oh sorry  its cool  maybe its about catfish  well this was fun
