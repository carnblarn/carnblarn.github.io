what to choose  ill give you the same advice my father gave me  the night i lost my virginity  just pick one  they all cost the same  you could always take  the actor inside with me and troy  howd you get dragged into that one  our dance teacher encourages us to take acting classes  to tap into our emotional cores  so troy and i both decided to take it together  hmm foosball was full  im on the wait list  dont give up  i was on the wait list for this media class  for a year and a half and i finally got in  who indeed a critical analysis  of televisions whos the boss  the professor of this

around me  and sit on the floor  a trust circle  its just a circle  its a circle sit down  acting is revealing expression  when we release pain  we become visible to each other  and that is an actors job  that and you know  pretending to be other people  lets start with you  access and share with us  a profoundly deep and painful memory  im on the playground  stop taunting me  i just want to go on

you grilling her  listen im gonna bust into her apartment  do you have any grappling hooks  maybe pierce finally found his soul mate  how can you say those things without any trace of irony  thats why they call me ironyfree annie  mm trust me thats not what they call you  yes  oh mr abed what can i do for you  i finished your book professor  and ive been watching episodes of whos the boss  and i think theres something that you might have overlooked  mr abed will you look at my wall   mmhmm  what do you see   photographs  of what   you  with whom  tony danza judith light alyssa milano  whos the boss season three caterer  gordon giddyup galligan  i have studied this show mister abed  i am not a fan  i am not a groupie  i am an academic  when i ask the question whos the boss  it is a rhetorical question  when i ask the question beyond the question what is a boss  i really think its angela because if its a boss  enough  i would like you to leave my room  my mind is open professor  its as open as the door to monas bedroom   its a shame yours isnt  i beg your pardon  you know i just got a wonderful idea  why dont you teach the next class  that way you can share your open mind with everybody  cool cool cool cool  pchew  i couldnt be more touched  that you all threw us an engagement party  you said if we didnt youd slash our tires  she is funny  like oprah  oprahs not a comedienne  no you are funny and you are like oprah  yeah what  thank you  pierce id like to offer my sincere congratulations  its hard enough to find people  you can stand in this life  let alone someone whos willing to stomach  your imminent dementia and present incontinence  thank you jeff  i just hope she can satisfy me  im like an insatiable baboon in the bedroom  dont sell yourself short  youre a baboon everywhere  seems like just yesterday  me and abed dined and ditched here  here hold this  ugh what is this  i always carry some spare apps in case the wait staffs racist  wheres a napkin  uh here you go  oh thanks  check that out  hats off to pierce and the hot red dragon  why do you keep calling her that  hong long means red dragon  but thats her middle name  in china they put the last name first  i mean theyre nuts over there  hmhmm  thank you all for coming  i know it seems fast  but when you find the right person you just know it  i know that because ive found the right person seven times  so the drinks are on me but stick to the crappy stuff  i dont want to get cornholed on the bar tab  pierce you cant just throw around a term like that  cornhole  cornhole cornhole  pierce troy was molested  cool  troy we didnt know  troy do you need me to recommend a support group  hey hes not a victim  youre a survivor  yeah about that  i wasnt so much molested  as much as i made it up  what  were gonna laugh so hard about this later  id like to propose a toast  wu mei hong long better known as mei hong long wu  is not only not a greendale student  she works for red dragon wwipes  the number two wipe in asia  currently attempting a takeover of hawthorne wipes  so please raise your glasses  to saving pierce from the clutches of a corporate spy  and to me for being attractive enough  to get a girl like her under normal circumstances  very impressive veronica mars  you learned how to use google  and you learned to fight your physical desire for me  oh stick it  you suck  wait wait wait  record scratch app  whered everybody go  most people went home  the rest went with chang to your place  to have a ketchup fight  oh jeez i better get back there  before he starts playing monkey drop  dont ask  oh uh do you want to come  why would i want to go anywhere with judas winger  youre mad at me you should be thanking me  for what ruining my relationship  what relationship  you just met the woman and the entire thing was a lie  she was just using you to get your company in china  and i was just using her to get her company in the sack  people use each other jeff  it doesnt mean that there arent good feelings  that go along with it  i liked her  she was busty  i thought we had something  i was trying to help you  i think what you were trying to do  is prove that no woman could want me  oh youre here  look britta im really sorry  troy kissing you was a mistake  it will never happen again  good  before my exboyfriend pablo was arrested  for forging church relics  he accused me of only being attracted  to a certain kind of guy  it was hard to understand him though  he was pretty huffed up on paint thinners  well maybe someday youll fall for someone whos healthy  someone who  other than his irrational fear of automatic toilets  is normal  who would like to begin today  i would  with a confession  my uncle never stuck his finger in my plopplop  i know im bummed about it too  im sorry  iwant to be interesting  i want to fit in with you guys  i want to be able to be an actor  the pain of not having enough pain  is still pain young man  that may seem like an easy resolution but  were not writers  were actors  story doesnt matter here  all that matters is our time  in the spotlight  and so by all known definitions  of the word boss ie one with authority over another  in 9 of 11 known possible fields  in which one might teach employ guide  oversee andor otherwise hold dominion  the empirically provable answer  to the question whos the boss is  angela bauer  class dismissed  class dismissed  theres a path you take and a path untaken  the choice is up to you my friend  i wonder why jeff and abed didnt show  well i dont know about abed  but im sure jeff just found another life to destroy  are you still thinking about studying acting  im auditioning for professor garritys  allblack production of fiddler on the roof  its called fiddla please  whats she doing here  i asked her to come  i was thinking maybe you two were meant to be together  youre both rude youre both deceitful and racist  and you both come from moist wipe dynasties  i think having that much in common  justifies at least one real date  i guess we could go out to one dinner   youre paying  youre dressing slutty  fine  how about mexican  how about thai  theyre like chinese mexicans   hmm so true  mmm   its hard to be jewish its hard to be jewish   its hard to be jewish in russia yo   its hard to be jewish its hard to be jewish   hard to be jewish in russia yo   bagels and lox diamond shops   its hard to be jewish in russia yo   hard to be jewish hard to be jewish   hard to be jewish in russia yo   someone drop an old testament beat  dreidels
