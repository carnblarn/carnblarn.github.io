                1 why does being a librarian make her even hotter  theyre keepers of knowledge  she holds the answers to all of our questions  like will you marry me  and why are there still libraries  i wanna be a book she can pick me up  flip through my pages  make sure nobody drew wieners in me  hey maybe if were too loud shell shush us  okay  books  pretend like youre asleep  jeff  what do you do when you and your best friend  wanna ask the same girl to the valentines dance  but neither of you have dibs  because you both fell in love with her at first sight  well i dont believe in dibs or love at first sight  or love or best friends or doing things  but its good you brought this to me  youre gonna have to open your heart one day jeff  what happens if i dont  i miss the heart opening deadline  valentines crapentines  opening my heart is on my list  pierce   mmhmm  what was that   gum  why arent you chewing  because im using my mouth for this dumb conversation  bye  thats my friend page shes cool butwhatever   shes cute  oh troy  before you go barking up that tree  i have to tell you that she might not be interested  why wouldnt she be  oh is she  a friend of ellen  yes annie but you can say the word  page is alesbian  pierce as someone whos been calling me a lesbian  for the last year and a half  im sure that you dont have anything to say  about me being friends with one  nothing off the cuff  what i do have is a prepared statement   give me some rope time in a tree  give me the hope to run out of steam  somebody said we could be here  we could be roped up tied up dead in a year  i cant count the reasons i should stay  one by one they all just fade away  and in summation  good luck  and bon appetit  many many paragraphs of that  were oddly supportive  wait till you hear the one i have for you  okay i know that wasnt gum  youre right it was an awesome exit pill  zip zop zooey  bye  we gotta do something about pierce and those pain killers  hes recovering  dude can moonwalk  now im sure hes almost through his prescription  besides hes a baby boom  they invented drugs  yeah they also invented tv  have you seen him control one of those  intervention intervention intervention   count me out  we cant count you out  he listens to you  well he also listens to the barenaked ladies  go get their dumb asses to help you   back it up  okay jeff  you are clearly in a bad space today  but pierce is our friend  and the barenaked ladies are triple platinum are you  why does everyone leap to defend that band  so aggressively  and how much stuff do we have to go through this year  before my friendship stops being questioned  well maybe friendship  is about going through a lot of stuff jeff  and maybe bnl has two billboard awards to your zero  oh okay theyre theyre bnl now  we use shorthand for the barenaked ladies  thats how fundamental they are   yeah  yeah  you know what pierce probably needs more than anything  some space maybe i do too  you know what maybe we all need some space  to pull the knife out of the back  of the most celebrated canadian alt rock band  of the midnineties you selfish jaded ass  thisis a fight  weare fighting  jeff

lack of world experience  creates curiosity but questions like that  can make you seem a little bit homophobic  its homophobic to ask questions  if you have to ask if its homophobic to ask questions  havent you already answered your own question  have i  dont know not a homophobe  oh theres page  should i ask her 500 questions about being a lesbian  or should i just treat her like a normal person

hope you found tonight therapeutic  because i would love to pretend that that was my plan  well i actually started to have fun  until that maniac tried to move in  what is it about me that makes broken people flock to me  is it my height  do huddled masses mistake me for the statue of liberty  i dont know  but being as how youre halfway through  your second year at greendale you may want to  either stop resisting  or admit that youre actually starting to enjoy it  well you assume i enjoy it  because you think youd enjoy it  thats true i am very lonely  you want a uh nice little taste  of what youre missing in a relationship  with six nutcases   yeah  lets turn on my phone  and listen to the 39 messages  they left tonight  you have no new messages  huh thats  huh  since youve got it

having a special nap  oh  thanks bro ill be gone in the morning  yeah whatever  okay maybe i stay a while   thirsty  dont push it  all right  it might not shock you guys to hear the real reason  we had a fight today  it wasnt about the barenaked ladies  although i do have some unresolved issues there  caring about a person can be scary  caring about six people can be a horrifying embarrassing nightmare  at least for me  but if i cant say it today  when can i say it  i love you guys  oh and pierce  take it from an expert  these knuckleheads are right outside your heart  let them in  before its too late  happy valentines day   be mine  right yes   love you  amazing  youre cute  no wait   kiss me  there has got to be a way  to make money off of this  ive been cheating  no it says email me
