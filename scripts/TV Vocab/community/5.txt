luis guzman  will ever come to visit his statue  if so id like to ask him about his movie choices  particularly carlitos way the cowboy way the hard way  and qa   yeah luis guzman is on a private jet from hollywood  because he cant wait to have that conversation with you   really how does he know about me   because he called me on my cell phone   why would a movie actor call you   you dont know

did right   yes i would  well im not gonna tell you  until i find out who didthis   what is that   its a tiny piece of paper okay  thats all it is tiny piece of paper  containing all the information covered on the test  otherwise known as a crib sheet  who did it huh  marianne   grandpa  jackee  kumar  theres one asian stereotype that does apply to me  whoever did this insulted my honor  and theyve got 24 hours to come forward  or mr miyagi here will wax off everyones score  and the whole class gets a cero  cept you toby     the only difference between seor chang and stalin  is that i know who seor chang is   did you hear him call me jackee  like im some black female caricature  if the good lord hadnt been watching  id have slapped him upside the head   who do you guys think cheated   flattering  but if im gonna cheat  im not gonna write information from a book  onto a piece of paper  thats practically learning for gods sakes  whoever made that crib sheet wasnt a real cheater  justinsecure and naive   i may be naive but im not stupid   well i may be stupid  but im not trying to look like im not   well i may be a genius but im not a lesbian     who cares who made the crib sheet  the only real cheater  is the guy whos threatening everyone with a zero   youre right its so unfair  and i cant handle this kind of stress right now  im already overwhelmed by my duties  on the school song committee  are you a musician   eew no i hired a local composer  but hes quite a handful   well i guess thats your fault isnt it   it is  youve got an accomplished  pianist and songwriter sitting 3 feet away from you  i wrote the jingle  for hawthorne wipes moist towelettes  i would have done your song for free  smooth move metamucil  troy could do the school song  troy invited rap music  and hes related to danny glover and president obama   abed have you been racist this whole time  while im telling everybody at church  what a sweet little caramel angel you are   hey man that stuff i said this morning wasnt true  i was just messin with you  you were lying   yeah as a joke  youve never had anybody mess with you before   yes just kidding no like that  this isnt a table  ha ha thats funny   remember when we used to study spanish   pierce  yo   i talked to the dean  and he said you can write greendales school song   well thats more like it   you know the

la musica  or everyone fails  no   you got ten seconds  starting now      no  ive never gotten a zero before   i did it  britta   well you really took your sweet time with that one baby   how dare you terrorize a class by threatening their grades  its not that easy to get human beings to turn on each other   turn on her   ow     real mature   thats right we are mature  too mature to sit in a class  with a cheating lying poopface  okay time to learn some formal greetings   so  wow   yeah i bet youre enjoying this   yeah well when we first met  like you were up here and i was here and now  oh wait i gave a quarter to a dirty bum today   what do you think theyre gonna do to me   well were not gonna buy you an ice cream  hi dean pelton   what an entrance i got to make there  you would be britta perry  i just spoke with seor chang  and im afraid greendale takes this kinda thing  very seriously   much like a university would  your case will be reviewed  by a disciplinary tribunal tomorrow  in borchart hall  you could be facing expulsion   isnt borchart hall the pool   there is an olympicsized pool there yes  but we will be next to it   using its 6000 judges table   uh is she allowed to have counsel  i mean i may not be a practicing lawyer anymore  but relative to this place im alan dershowitz   oh okay ouch and yes  if youd like you may represent her  dean you later   im not gonna sit while some hokey tribunal  gets its jollies judging me   hey if you show up with me follow my lead  and deny everything youll walk  thats the winger guarantee   i get it  you think youre gonna save my bacon  using your lawyer powers  and send me into fits of grateful arousal   i can neither confirm nor deny that  see how good i am   hey troy did you hear  all dogs are blue now  every single dog in the world is blue    im just messing with you   yeah i know but let me explain to you  a few things about how this works  uh first of all i cannot be got  because i am not gullible like you  secondly you are not good at this  because you are not believable in your face okay  your face its bad  okay   um also    you gotta ride the line between believable and      what are you writing in   its a notepad   yeah but what are what language   its probably arabic       all right i am convening this disciplinary tribunal  at our stateoftheart judges table  which has its own builtin sound system  so take that yale   our judges include myself uh dean craig pelton   professor ian duncan   professor ben chang   uh no youre a teacher youre not a professor   maybe because i dont look like ron weasley   thats the difference  thats the qualifying factor   gentlemen point of order  how can seor chang be one of the judges  hes the one accusing my client   yeah well you got prince charles over here  whos your drinking buddy   oh got me   well it sounds like there are two biases  one on each side and i go both ways  oh lets strike that  lashonda can we please strike that  i am impartial so it should all work out  okay lets begin   fine the tribunal calls teacher chang   okay just keep it up frostnixon   i was planning on doing that  cleared my whole day  uh mr chang could you remind us  of the events of yesterday   with great pleasure it was a tuesday  uh crack of dawn  i got up i took my morning deuce  i made a breakfast consisting of    greendale    greendale    slop    mm nah   green     greegreen    greendale isnt a slop pail     hi almost done   oh good   you can tell the dean ill have a song  thatll make the devil poop gods pants   thats exciting  mind if i hear what you got so far   well uh yeah sure  i uhill probably open with something like this uh    you know a note like that  and end with a note like that  uh the words i cant tell you  you know the rest is really a surprise   im just a little worried  i keep hearing the same two notes  and your sheet music  looks like a chinese takeout menu   a musician sees music in everything annie  i mean it could be   moo shoo pork    squab with lettuce    you see i mean it just comes out  you know what you really shouldnt be here right now   what   you are inside a throbbing cosmic womb  of creativity  and when this baby starts kicking  i cannot be responsible for your sanity   i know it sounds funny  but let me play you out okay    playing you out now this song  you know like on stage playing you out okay  thanks for coming byebye         and then she yelled screw you  or screw education or something like that  and then she stormed out of the room  in her highheel boots like it was tampon time  if you know what i mean   objection i dont know what he means   please dont encourage him winger  do you have any more questions   the defense calls britta perry   now are those the highheel boots  he was talking about  yes   are they comfortable  yeah   im just curious theyre cute   thank you  miss perry  did you make that crib sheet   no   she confessed   she confessed to protect her classmates  because you were threatening to flunk everyone   you did what   oh shut your pompous vortex of overlapping fangs   hey british dentistry is not on trial   dean pelton i move this case  be thrown out of  the pool area   well it certainly    well it certainly sounds to me  that this young ladys only crime  is being a hero and wanting to be taller  this tribunal is adjourned   wait i cheated  and were back   objection my client did not cheat   yes i did   yes she did  but why  thats the real question isnt it  the world wasnt the only thing that changed  on september 11th   oh come on

have our defense  gentlemen  my client is insane   what    gentlemen im sure you suspected  that ms perry was pretty odd before the recess  but if you couldve heard all the stuff  she just told me in the shower  you would realize she is all the way out  of her entire damn mind  she doesnt want to succeed  because she doesnt think she can  so she goes out of her way to fail  thats crazy  but  do we
