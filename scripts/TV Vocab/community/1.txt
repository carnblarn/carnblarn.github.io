 hey this is kind of like breakfast club huh   we are in a library  yeah im sure  weve each got an issue balled up inside of us that would make us cry if we talked about it  do you have something balled up inside of you  well i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional  hey text message lets give this bad boy a read   its probably just for you  ive never gotten one of these  theyre its probably you just  say you have to pee i need to talk to you   say you have to pee  that is weird   say you have to pee i need to  yeah do you have to pee   no  hmm   thats so weird  well im stumped thats very creepy  that makes two of us   whats that  does it say you have to pee  no its just someone with a misguided grasp of abbreviation  i just need five minutes you guys so go ahead and study all the  verbs in spanish   abed  yeah  whats your read on that guy  you look like elisabeth shue  just act natural  pretend youre watching the athletic proceedings  you couldnt stop me from watching them  theres a guy trying out for the track team that is older than the game of poker  hes kind of trucking  suppose i was to say to you it was possible to get those test answers  i would say go for that and could have said so in a text  im asking you if you know the difference between right and wrong  i discovered at a very early age that if i talk long enough  i could make anything right or wrong  so either im god or truth is relative   and in either case booyah  oh interesting  its just the average person has a much harder time saying  booyah to moral relativism  duncan you dont have to play shrink to protect your pride  i accept youre chicken  are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist  no im just using regular psychology on a spineless british twit  im a professor you cant talk to me that way  a sixyearold girl could talk to you that way   yes because that would be adorable  no because youre a fiveyearold girl  and theres a pecking order   fine ill do it  thank you  yeah pleasure  bye  yes good  why am i still shouting im drawing attention to myself  you guys arent gonna believe this but the rest of the group  is here  are you the boardcertified tutor  that means you do my homework right seacrest  i need to call my babysitter if were gon be later than 1000  what board certifies a tutor   wheres britta  not sure  but i invited more people from spanish class is that cool  its the coolest  im gonna go to the bathroom  and bring my jacket wallet and keys with me  in case theres a fire  should we go with him  im leaving my homework with slumdog millionaire over here  thats borderline racist i think  and busted   uh listen  now you know im a smoker  yeah but theyre filtered so that makes them safe  you ready to get started looks like the rest of your group showed up  yeah not mine actually i think abed took out a page on craigslist  and i was trained never to say this  but i think that group may be untutorable  oh really  so why dont you and i go study over   dinner  or drinks  i think actually we should prioritize here  and study first and then go to dinner  and if they really prove to be untutorable  well slip out early  oh they will be  untutorable  all right  look at this crew all ready to study all night   well i can stay at least till 1000  but who studies with strangers right   my name is jeff  jeff its a pleasure  my name is pierce hawthorne and yes  that is hawthorne as in hawthorne wipes the awardwinning moist towellete  i was just going to ask  im also a toast master so perhaps i should do the introductions   definitely  all right you already know brittles   britta  abed abed the arab   is that inappropriate  sure  roy roy the wonder boy   troy  little princess elizabeth  annie  and finally this beautiful creature is named shirley  is that even close  id like to know why i had to find out about this group on accident  this is getting way more like breakfast club now   theres breakfast  okay um maybe we should get started  ive been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension  shouldnt we address annies concern did we not invite her  well annie sweetie its not behind your back  can we stop with the pumpkins and the sweeties  being younger does not make me inferior  if anything your age indicates that youve made bad life decisions   shirley has a response to that  no no no i dont   you should it looks like you do  shirley go ahead  okay okay um  im sure ive made some bad life decisions  and maybe annies decisions will be better  but i think she needs to decide whether she wants to be considered a child  or an adult because children get pity when not respected  adults they get respect  but they also get the back of they head grabbed and their face pushed through jukeboxes  okay why dont we try learning jukebox in spanish   what are you doing  pierce   lets discuss this creepiness  pardon you   what are you doing  im certified  are you unaware that shirley finds your advances inappropriate  what advances  you have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class  sexually harassing  what that makes no sense to me  why would i harass somebody who turns me on  saying she turns you on is the harassment dude  hey  i am a prominent business leader and a highly sought after dinner guest  and i will not take courting advice from some teenage boy  well this teenage boy is a quarterback and a prom king  youre not prom king anymore troy this isnt riverside high  howd you know i went there  because youre still wearing your stupid letter jacket  and more importantly i sat behind you in algebra  well youre the girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out  youre little annie adderall  yes and you are a stupid jock  who lost his scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand  keg flip theyre very hard to pull off  you dont know im a legend  would everybody just  you know what i got for christmas  it was a banner year at the bender family  i got a carton of cigarettes  the old man grabbed me he said hey smoke up johnny  no dad what about you  well uh  that that actually was from the breakfast club  nobody puts baby in the corner  dirty dancing hello  its professor duncan come to the parking lot now  whats wrong with your voice  im disguising it  uh ill be right back  but while im gone you guys need to hash this stuff out  no stone unturned  go  what is he talking about  get in the car  act as if weve either just finished or yet to begin driving  every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester  i knew you could do it buddy thank you  whoa there grabbygrabby   what do i get  the satisfaction of being even  even fairness right wrong there is no god booyah booyah  what do you want from me  your lexus  my car for a semesters worth of answers  will it be just a semester though jeff  wont you be taking the easy way out for the next four years  i want payment in advance  i want leather seats with builtin ball warmers  you know bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies  have a nice disbarment hearing  what am i supposed to drive  why dont you take this car its good for the earth  yeah so is wiping your butt with a leaf but its not how a man gets around   it is a disaster in there  yeah untutorable  you like thai food i love thai food  wait so this is a game to you you put human beings  into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants  why cant you see that for the compliment that it is  okay okay okay im sorry it was an accident  i did a little bit of lying to get close to you  but how was i supposed to know that you were smart and cool  i mean you look like elisabeth shue   youre unbelievable  what do you want me to do  oh maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess  okay i am the barack obama of this room  okay if i do that then dinner right  im here to learn spanish i got children at home  yeah fine whatever  as if theres a dinner on earth that could make me forget  you are a shallow douchebag  oh youre gonna eat those words when you see my new car  all right everybody  i want to say something sit down  you dont have to yell i dont appreciate your tone  you know what makes humans different from other animals  feet  no no no come on bears have feet  were the only species on earth that observes shark week  sharks dont even observe shark week but we do  for the same reason i can pick up this pencil  tell you its name is steve and go like this  and part of you dies just a little bit on the inside  because people can connect with anything  we can sympathize with a pencil we can forgive a shark  and we can give ben affleck an academy award for screenwriting   big mistake  hes got a point  people can find the good in just about anything but themselves  look at me its clear to all of you that i am awesome  but i can never admit that because that would make me an ass  but what i can do is see what makes annie awesome  shes driven we need driven people  or the lights go out and the ice cream melts  and pierce we need guys like pierce  this guy has wisdom to offer   the dalai lama and i  we should listen to him sometime  we wouldnt regret it and shirley  shirley has earned our respect not as a wife not as a mother  but as a woman  and dont test her on that because that thing about the jukebox  was way too specific to be improvised  and troy  who cares if troy thinks hes all that  maybe he is  you think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen  no theyre trying to impress their high schools prom king  and abed  abeds a shaman you ask him to pass the salt  he gives you a bowl of soup because you know what  soup is better abed is better  you are all better than you think you are  you are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself  soup  i want you to look to the person to your left  sorry look at the person sitting next to you  look at her okay   this  yeah  i want you to extend to that person  the same compassion that you extend to sharks pencils and ben affleck  i want you to say to that person i forgive you   i forgive you  i forgive you   i forgive you  you little twerp  pierce id like you to say i forgive you  he didnt say it  youve just stopped being a study group  you have become something unstoppable  i hereby pronounce you a community  oh thats nice i like that  this isnt like breakfast club anymore now its like stripes or meatballs  anything with bill murray really  i agree with abed that tonight has been very special  and now if youll excuse me  i have a dinner engagement with britta   britta  i lied  thanks for calming everyone down but since youre not a spanish tutor  just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone  in an attempt to get with me id appreciate it if you left  and stopped wasting all of our time  everybody ready  fine  and im happy to report  that one of the benefits of being a lying creep  is having all the answers to tomorrows test  and im happy to share them with anyone  whose time ive wasted more than theyve wasted mine  uh jeff if you have all the answers  why the hell did you start this study group  i dont have a study group pierce i made it up   what about the look left speech  made it up thats what i do  i make things up and i got paid a lot of money  to do it before i came to this schoolshaped toilet   i was a lawyer  oh god  that explains everything  you know i thought you were like bill murray in any of his films  but youre more like michael douglas in any of his films   yeah  yeah  well you have aspergers  ass burger   its a serious disorder  it really is  if its so serious why dont they call it meningitis  yeah   ass burger  burger for your ass  jeffrey before you say anything you may want to think about the gift youve been given   an excuse to punch a hippy  no no not that  an important lesson my friend  you see the tools you acquired to survive out there  will not help you here at greendale  what you have my friend is a second chance at an honest life  why are people trying to teach me things  at a school that has an express tuition aisle  give me my keys  no i have to keep the car for the lesson the less  dont hit me please dont hit me  jeffrey jeffrey are we cool  are we cool  we cool  i like you jeffrey  you remind me of myself at your age  i deserve that  you know  ive been divorced seven times  sometimes i think im doing something wrong  you keep getting married  i never looked at it that way  shouldnt you guys be studying  yeah things got kind of boring after you left  let me ask you something  people been clowning me about this jacket since i got here but  if i take it off to make them happy that just makes me weak right  listen it doesnt matter  you lose the jacket to please them you keep it to piss them off  either way its for them thats whats weak  wow  you just wrinkled my brain man   hes good isnt he  hes real good  shouldnt you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers  i dont have any of the answers  im gonna im gonna flunk the test  you just like study for like an hour its not that hard  you seem pretty smart you got a sports coat  well me  funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life  without ever having to do any work  so uh  im not really sure how to do that  whats going on  can you guys hear me am i deaf   can you hear me talking right now yes  yes  thats good  you know what  jeff actually we didnt get that far without you  so if you want to come back upstairs  really  well it is your study group so   come on lets study  sounds good  no pressure  im sorry i called you michael douglas and i see your value now  well thats the nicest thing anyones ever said to me
