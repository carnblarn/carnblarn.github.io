little like vince vaughn but smells a lot like fish  i dont want to talk about it  well i have someone in my life  that im happy to talk about  again with the jesus  well jesus is always in my life

what i mean  i am sick of the runaround  im here to demand an immediate answer  about whether im joining the study group  well if we have to give an immediate answer  it would have to be no  take your time  sleep on it  then get back to me  or else  jeff you did say we would let him in eventually  that was before he started using his name as a pun  it makes me so changry  oh god its happening to me  lets get back to who annies in love with   is it fat neil  blue streak  mud flaps  okay even i know some of these are transformers  who cares who it is lets just study  study what we havent had our first class yet  well could we talk about something  other than annies love life  we could talk about my love life  is it jeanclaude van overbite  we should really start learning peoples names  i agree with brown jamie lee curtis  give me some rope   time in a dream   give me the hope   to run out of steam   somebody said it could be here   we could be roped up tied up dead in a year   i cant count the reasons i should stay   one by one they all just fade away   duncans late  i hope he didnt drive his car into another marathon  shirley how can you want to date your exhusband   after what he did to you  he apologized  oh he apologized  well i guess that completely unbangs that stripper  well forgive me for being forgiving  oh thats right you dont know how  im relieved shirley is seeing her exhusband  and not chang  chang why would she be with chang  why do i have to say everything im thinking  i wish my mouth was further away from my brain  i wish my brain had its own brain  i wish chang hadnt had sex with shirley  what when  where  how  i cant talk about it  troy im your roommate  i can keep a secret  okay remember that halloween party  that none of us can remember  i dont remember anything we can remember  well chang left me a message that night  saying that they did it  but but you cant tell anybody  you have my word as your roommate  and that is a bond i will never violate  you cant tweet it either  we never discussed new media  sorry all that stuff got dragged out  about me having a crush on somebody  why would you be sorry about that  you know awkward  annie you dont think i actually care did you  no no i just didnt want you to think i thought you cared  greetings all and sundry  and welcome to your second semester of anthropology  where it is about to get real  now i forget where we left off last year   fat neil  the bronze age  thank you fat neil  neils fine  not from an actuarial standpoint  now please forgive my lateness  but i wasnt sure how to find greendale sober  yes you heard me right  i have stopped drinking  mainly due to the fact that i could no longer get an erection  now that im on the wagon  you can expect both this class  and my penis to be more focused and rewarding  also theres gonna be more than one diorama  lame   boo  i am so sorry  i train seeingeye dogs and today was graduation  i couldnt leave without shaking all their little paws   aww  rich   jeff  rich   annie  annie rich  youre taking anthropology  well you made it sound so fun  we spent the holiday break  dredging a river together we found  a finger yeah  it sounds gruesome i know  but im used to seeing that kind of thing   because im a doctor  all ohh  i cant believe rich actually enrolled in our class  it means he likes me right  why wouldnt he annie he is so sweet  yeah sweet and wise  he has lived such a long full life  how old is he again   he has a landline and uses the word album  you guys dont think hes too old for me do you   no  no come on  by that logic i wouldnt have a shot with anybody at this table  ugh  oh speaking of creepy  sober duncan is worse than drunk duncan  i think this class is about to get really hard  i have an idea about that  rich is really smart  and he knows a lot about anthropology  if we were to start studying with him  i think it could help a lot  plus you know  oh you know what though  i just realized so unfair to so many people  right britta youre always talking  about how its weird  we have no one of latin descent   in our group  si  and pierce youre always looking  for someone old enough  to find your racism subversive  i could go on and on  it is a process  it takes time  well then i say we gather all the candidates  and make an informed democratic decision  we can have a little mixer  and invite the people were submitting for consideration   all in favor of tonight  oh i am  thank you im finished  no id say you got about two more good years  oh everyone  this is andre my exhusband and boyfriend  he came to spend the day with me  hey nice to meet you guys  you know ive heard a lot about every last one of you  we havent heard a lot about you or what youve done  or with who  well i hope you give me a chance to make up  for everything you havent heard about me  hey how about a round of soft serve on me  shirley ive been fed a lot of soft serve  by a lot of guys  sometimes its rent money  sometimes its chili peppers tickets  and yeah ill admit it  one time it was a gym bag full of nickels  but it never lasts and they never change  britta im a grownass woman and i made my decision  but how do you know its the right one  because im pregnant okay  i was going to wait to share my exciting news  but i guess now is as good a time as any to tell you  that i am eight weeks along  which is a little surprising  halloween   what  both nothing  thanks for coming fellow anthropology students  for the first semester  you knew us as that study group  but tonight we want to get to know you  please forgive the spread  the vending machines havent been restocked  since before winter break  so help yourselves to tropical skittles  cigarettes or mouthwash  and have a good time  okay so i have to figure out if shirley did it  with her exhusband the week after halloween  how are you gonna do that  i got moves  sobun in the oven  guess its no surprise after working on it all this time  well i wouldnt quite say working on it  just kind of happens you know  oh yeah i do  especially when the seasons right  dead leaves pumpkins everywhere  natures viagra right  i guess  and then when all the pumpkins  just start to rot  and all the children have removed their outfits  because theyve already gotten their candy  im gonna go talk to some other people all right   so  his mind is like a fortress  why dont we just tell shirley  hey look you slept with chang  let her deal with it  pierce if someone had sex with chang  and they get to not remember that happened  thats a gift from god  im not taking that away from her without a good reason  well heres a good reason  you ever go to the bathroom  and find parsley in your teeth  that your friends hadnt told you about  now imagine your teeth are a uterus  and that parsley is a halfchinese baby  hey guys  i want you to meet someone  my name is quendra  and i spell it with a qu  shes thinking about taking anthropology  so maybe she would make a nice addition or two  to our study group something to consider  are you abed  i love star wars   thats troy  i love footballs  jeff were dealing with heavier things right now  than your shameless lobbying  rich brought kettle corn  kettle corn thats a funtime snack   oh looks great  i make it in my garage  ill take some of that  i spell kettle corn with a qu  well dont  what is this whats going on  its a mixer  why is everyone from anthro class here  are you guys picking a new study group member  and you didnt invite me  we didnt know how to reach you  what are you talking about im everywhere  we didnt know how to reach you  thats not a true thats a lie  its a mixer we didnt know how to reach you  its a mixer its a mixer its a mixer  its a mixer its a mixer  works every time  50 what a pig  jeff i think we should vote now  most people left after we ran out of skittles  and come on its pretty obvious  rich is the best candidate  yeah looks like hes our guy  ill be right there  this cant be happening  i agree  you cant talk and then do a slow clap  you dont know that  but i know this  unless you want a front row seat to annie loves richie  its time to chang your point of view  its not even clever  you keep using it as the word change  okay okay  okay just do me a favor  let me do all the talking and follow my lead   deal  okay  seriously do you have brain damage  rich is also boardcertified in pediatrics  and once a month he flies down to volunteer  in the rain forest fixing childrens cleft palates  and teaching them acoustic guitar  other than that  well his kettle corn speaks for itself  i couldnt agree more  it looks like this is an openandshut case  did someone say case  because i havent made mine yet  what whats your case  ben chang is my case  you cant be serious  oh im serious baby  i am yahoo serious  im serious fm  welcome to the world serious of seriousness  sponsored by honey nut serios  are you stalling right now  stalling  stalling  no annie in fact youre gonna wish  i was stalling oh i just got it thank you  i want to say some names to you  jeffrey dahmer  ted bundy  rich  what do they have in common  we dont know them very well  what do we know about ben chang   we know hes nuts  let him finish  we know hes dangerous unpredictable selfish  we know he uses his name to make bad puns  guilty as changed  when he talks he over and underemphasizes words  seemingly at random  when he eats he holds his fork  like a murderers knife  gnawing at its skewered payload like a deranged woodland rodent  bring it home  we know he smells like bandaids  we know he dresses like a cuban cab driver  we know he exhibits nay flaunts proudly  obvious symptoms of over half a dozen disorders  you wouldnt wish on your worst enemys pets  feel the heat  we know these things about ben chang  and so much more than we ever wanted to know about him  why  because its there  its on the surface  what you see may be what you dont want  but its also what you get  wow  who is this kettlecornpopping phantom  this human question mark  this number eight scoop of vanilla tapioca  with a phd in being swell  and a masters in everybody loves me  who is it  we may never know  i only know one thing  nobody is this good a person  and nobody can get any worse  than this  now  whos voting for chang  whos voting for rich   shirley  wow
