                good afternoon greendale community college  i am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalog  cosmology should be cosmetology  astrology should be astronomy  and the students on the cover should be smiling  thats a matter of opinion  patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium  congratulations you have won a cruise  report to security to claim your tickets  in order to increase awareness of homelessness  security has been given binoculars  in campus news  the debate over our librarys pa system continues  with some students suggesting its volume be lowered  while others question its very purpose  more on that story as it unfolds   he makes a lot of announcements  i like it  every ten minutes a new scene of a tv show  illusion only lasts until someone says something theyd never say on tv  like how much their life is like tv there its gone  i guess jeffs running late again  what a shame we should get started  we should wait for jeff before we start studying   when jeff gets here   about his tardiness  dont use that word around abed  f you want me to have a chat with jeff id be happy to do it  weve got a bond going kind of sorta like brothers  take baths together cause one of you wouldve been 30  thats funny  jeff probably comes late not to sit through your tardiness  sorry  will you have some self respect  youre obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought  killed by their own government  you jumped a column whats happening there   nothing  journalists are being murdered  believe me every day in that country killed for speaking out  the worst part of it is when its over   spoilers would never even happened  real stories they dont have spoilers  you understand that tv and life are different right   milady  milord   baby  sweetie   you smell nice vitamin p  morning jeffrey  people were jazzed to see me too   word em up  word em everywhere   good entrance  that was for you  theres something   actually theres nothing  if youre gonna study with people  to show up on time  were you waiting  personal lives and your cool emotional problems  i never have anything to offer  truth is my life is emptier than this threering binder  you have any spanish notes that might fit in there  doublespaced thank you  whats a guy got to do to get a c around here  oneliner  good studying see you later bye  you know what today is  the twoweek anniversary of my horrible first impression   theres a card for that  not specifically  but if you think of grandsons as a metaphor for friendship  youll agree with this transformer here  that its time for ours to become a man  by reading from the torah  to me cause a life full of ups and downs  has given me doucheray vision but those are good people in there  and they trust and respect you watching you exploit them bums me out   exploit them theyre my friends  you want me to bring your car around  i dont want you to bring my car around  ill bring yours around good guy you get going all right  youre cute  but selfish and narcissistic to the point of near delusion  she said i was cute  tell you what you take her i have less to prove  you cant pursue people so desperately  it starts to creep them out  why dont we go get a beer ill give you some advice  and we can have what the kids calls a sausage fest  im not much of a sausage guy maybe next time  next time then   will you tell us more about guatemala  i never went to a real college  you should discover that stuff on your own  but we need your help  weve been living on the wrong side of the looking glass  youre like jodie foster or susan sarandon  keep it real than be likeable  tell us what to google  you could start with this journalist chacatapanecos  he wrote an article critical of the government and they killed him   thats horrible  can we have a protest   something  we could have a candlelight vigil   like lesbians have on the news  i could make brownies  brownies  every once in a while a student come up to me and ask  seor chang why do you teach spanish  they say it just like that  why do you teach  spanish  why you  why not math  why not photography  why not martial arts  i mean surely it must be in my nature  to instruct you in something  thats ancient and secret  like building a wall that you can see from outer space  ill tell you why i teach spanish  it is none of your business okay  now i dont want to have any conversations  about what a mysterious and inscrutable man i am  i am a spanish genius  in espaol my nickname is  el tigre chino  cause my knowledge will bite her face off  so dont question seor chang or youll get bit  ya bit  ya bit  friday maana well have conversations with the rest of the class  using some of the phrases we learned in unit one  youll be partnering up in pairs of dos  if you look under your desk  youll find a card with either a picture or a word on it  for ejemplo blondie aqui  has a card with a picture of a house on it  so that means the person with the card with the word casa on it is her partner  comprende starburns  see you friday find your partners have a great day  what do we say at the end of every class  come on hands  you want to trade cards  ill give you 20 bucks   50 bucks  i dont want your money your shirt   what first day   fine give me your card  i want to wear it out of here  what are the odds  are you sure you didnt adjust the odds  i know abeds been eyeing that shirt for three weeks  its almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards  i gave abed my shirt because im not selfish   discover while we are working on this  tomorrow night dinner drinks  i think thats something we should discuss with our partners  see i did switch cards  can you believe this what are the odds  thats a nice shirt want to sell it  whats the moist towelette industry like  believe me its nothing like the product  its a hard dry large business  destroyed all my marriages  it didnt help i cant have children im not sterile  in fact its a rare condition they call hypervirility  apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets   can you believe that  i cant  but you can so thats fine  the assignment is  to write a spanish conversation using those five phrases  hemingways lemonade   no need to make it a long evening  am i a piece of garbage to you  what  got ya  lets have one drink before we work  to the empowerage of words  to the irony of that sentence  so whats up with you jeffrey seems like you got a burr up your ass  i guess that its   its britta  forget her  you just have to know her name what is she a water filter  shes ugly   why dont we start with me saying  what are you doing  our assignment  this is the first time peoplell see winger and hawthorne together  we show them were a force to be reckoned with  come on lets brainstorm some story ideas  better yet before we do that lets ask ourselves   what is a story  my god in heaven  like that brownie youll hate whats up on in guatemala  google it  raise the truth  once it gets dark  i hand out the candles and we do a speechless protest  we put tape over our mouths  and gather handinhand in a sea of outraged silence   what with you  this aint how you do this  we know its not how you do it cause were doing everything  but this is tacky and lame  i didnt mean that  im sorry  what i meant to say  is that this cause is really personal to me  are you saying that were not allowed to protest   you sound like guatemala  somebody has a case of  likes to use french politics to make themselves special  but doesnt actually ever want to do anythingitis  i do things  i went to  i dont do anything  what can i do  you hang the chacatapanecos piata  you guys realize he was beaten to death right  thats where we got the idea from  poignant   tell me what ive got so far  what we have so far  we have something incredibly long  and very confusing and a little homophobic  and really really specifically  surprisingly and gratuitously critical of israel  its called two conquistadors should probably be dos  i mean it is a spanish class  which reminds me the only thing not included in this  are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade  youre right needs more work   whatre you guys doing  i have no idea   we head to the demonstration  hippies   some cause brittas into  a silent protest lots of candles  gets the ladies in the mood for social change   a chance to put miles on this shirt  conversations are due in the morning  right  what do you want to do  hacks  what do we do about the ending of act two  i tell you what were gonna do  we gonna take this and we gonna put it in a museum for crazy people  then were gonna take this  and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class   good night  wait a minute  youre bailing on our first sausage fest  this is your definition of friendship  this is my definition of you trying way too hard  and me finding it harder and harder to stay polite  now this was a fine enough way to spend an evening devoid of hope  but a woman i kind of like  is out there caring about something stupid  and this is my chance to show her i care enough to act like i care too   thats all you had to say  that was it  that wouldve been great if i had done that two hours ago  nice sign  i like what youve done with the place  i think i was a little too harsh on you  im not perfect  i am id be happy to show you the ropes  awesome  look at awesome jeffrey winger  too awesome for old pierce  with your hip shirts  and your gelled hair  and your cool  tape over your mouth  why are you wearing tape over their mouth  its a protest  good  cause i know what id like to protest  how much you hurt me  conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family   you have horrible breath right now  you constantly blow me off  you want me to do your homework  you tell me im trying too hard to be your friend so you have to go  you have to come out here to pretend  to care about the stupid stuff she cares about   his words not mine  he is paraphrasing  pierce i got an idea  get a coffee  hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about your sperm  ill show you some sperm buddy  was this your idea what the hell fire  im not ready to die  hes jumped in the fountain  hes fine   have you seen it  we did it girl page three  mostly about pierce but listen to last paragraph  the incident occurred during a protest regarding events in guatemala   awareness  its not the school paper  its a real paper theres a marmaduke in there  its more than i ever accomplished  you know about the ethnic cleansing in burma  need to bust out brownie mix  morning  i get it garfields wishing me a happy arbor day   youd like a fresh start  nice try  its secretarys day and it says im sorry about crashing your protest  with that drunken selfimmolating baby boomer  we dont blame you he has always been on my watch list  that dude is crazy he told me girls have two pee holes  i sang christmas carols at a nursing home once  ive seen the face of dementia and last night i saw it again  you know what he did thats really crazy  he offered me 100 to switch cards with him  just so he could be partners with jeff  he thought getting closer to jeff would bring him respect in the group  i think he spent his whole life looking out for himself  and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family  time for our presentations  first up was supposed to be jeff and pierce  but pierce explained the situation  apparently there was a falling out things were said people were betrayed  jeff having heard pierces side of the story  the only humane thing to do would be to give you a c  and let him do his presentation alone if that sounds fair to you  that doesnt sound fair to me at all  i understand if you dont want to be my friend  but this thing weve created  it is bigger than the both of us  and it deserves to be done right  all right  why are there costumes involved these are short conversations   theyre not supposed to take  your breath away  well tough  you ready amigo  f  fminus  what  did you say s  so  that was one of the worst things i have ever seen  which i guess makes being a part of it a pretty selfless act  so im impressed  how do you know i didnt do it just to get another shot at you  cause a smart guy like you would know  no woman would be able to look at you as a sexually viable candidate  ever again  no i know  i thought of that  she looked back  you did an all right job up there my friend  you got this thing you do with your face when youre trying to be funny  that forces people to think about how cool you think you are    my name is tbone         head is ice cream     the goats mustache   its 2009  word
