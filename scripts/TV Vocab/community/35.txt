crichton is longing for a planet that no longer exists   ha hey youre really nursing that beer   ahh which would make sense  because what kind of wormhole would it be  if it could only move from one place to another  within the same galaxy on the same day   you know speaking of wormholes  uh whaddaya say we use one to  teleport this conversation someplace a little more private   that doesnt make any sense  wormholes and teleportation are two different things  thats what ive been talking about this whole time   i noticed  cheers   i followed that band phish spells it with ph  i just lived in
