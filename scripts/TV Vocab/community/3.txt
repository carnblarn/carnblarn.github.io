situation troy  no those are both for me  you were on top of the world before  and now no one gives a rats ass  i can help you with your image  first lose the jacket  you look like a high school bitch  but more importantly its your sneeze  when i was a ceo  i had an array of masculine sneezes  that asserted dominance  you know like the explosive  shocktheroomintosilence sneeze  the     or the drawthemin sneeze  you know   and maybe i wouldnt sneeze because im in control  you could even use a sneeze to drive home a point even  like i think i think the cubs  are going to win it all this year

do you mean jeff  what does your life mean  how long does it take you in the morning  toto make it look like you have bed head  how many sweat pants sport jacket combos did you try  before you found the one that said i dont care  seize the day jeff for real  go running naked in a hailstorm  kiss a girl in the middle of the day  fly a kite but do it for yourself  or you wont just fail my class  youll fail life   thank you  that guys really got your number   drop the flower   look i really need to talk to you about abed  i went by his film class today he wasnt there  hes cutting  i want to know why he would do something like that   ask him   every time i try to ask him about it  he just keeps filming me and telling me  that im playing the role of his mother   abed is not normal  thats what you bought  when you intentionally tangled yourself in his life   look will you just will you please talk to him   ive got problems of my own  im out here trying to seize a day  what in the hell  is he gonna kill us   thanks for the pizza abed i was starving   yeah its nice like alike a picnic   or a family dinner   its a study group and a pizza  lets not get carried away       so abed hows film class   good   yeah did you go to class today   not really  not really  well brittas paying for those classes  dont you think maybe you should go   i was shooting my movie   yeah but your movies for class   my movies more important  well ooh la la   someone order seven lattes   i got that  no you dont got it  i got it abed i got everything  what is wrong with you  all i want to do is take care of you  i know youre not stupid are you doing this on purpose  why wont you answer me   cause this is the scene where you leave   you better believe it   britta   what do you think dad   i think you are really weird abed  and i think the wrong person just left   perfect thats a wrap   that guy was your dad   hey  hey  you dont really have tickets for ravi shankar do you   i lied to get you here  because its time to communicate   communicate have you met abed   its not the two of you that need to talk   hey wait a minute wheres weezer   theyre coming  all right now the only reason  why this whole mess got started  is because both of you wanted the best for abed  and i think the lesson we can all take away from this  is that everyone should always do  whatever they want and leave each other out of it   is that your take let me give you mine  you and your pillowlipped girlfriend  got all up in my stuff because you wanted to be cowboys  and then you turned chicken when you found out  it will take more than speeches and guided missiles   interesting hadnt seen the iraq metaphor but   what iraq metaphor  i am talking about your speeches  and her guided  got it  the point is is that britta is sorry right   wrong  crap   abed may not be a great filmmaker  but that doesnt mean that he wants to make falafel  you need to let him make his own decisions   make his own decisions  have you met abed you know who he is   guys  yes   guys  he loves   im finished  britta jeff dad  dad         hows it going buddy   i dont want to be your father    i think you are weird abed   okay look i need to talk to you about abed   hes not normal     what is wrong with you  all i want to do is take care of you  why will you not answer me         what do you think dad   i think you are weird abed  and i think the wrong person just left   its not exactly citizen kane      i feel a little out of the loop here   that feeling is called the joy of freedom   my son is hard to understand  if making movies help him be understood  then i pay for the class    i made this all happen   with falafel as a fallback   abed  yeah   did you do all of that to me on purpose  thats not a very nice way to treat your friends   well britta it isnt called friend business  its called show business   hes smoking   honey let him leave the nest   get your hand off my knee  sorry      godgod bless you god bless you   thank you   for someone who doesnt like getting involved  well i owe you   you owe me  that cannot be comfortable for you   hey um you should kiss me right now   day seized  were even    a plus winger  i know a lifechanging kiss when i see one  wowee ha ha    yeah fooled you
