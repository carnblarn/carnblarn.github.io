riverside highwhoa  troy did you know that greendale has a football team   did you know they had a football   ha thats very funny  troy i was so sorry to hear about your injury  but now that you have recovered  we would love for you to play for the human beings   the teams name is the human beings   yeah my idea  it was the greendale grizzlies  but i thought that um   well a lot of these students  have been called animals their whole lives  unfortunately i dont know what to do about the mascot   oh i can help you with that your honor  i have a wealth of experience  in image management icon development  and y2k preparedness  troy all of your friends are lining up  to turn greendale around  how about you   troy isnt interested in football anymore  getting injured in that keg stand  was the best thing that ever happened to him   whoa yoko ono much  bros before hoes troy    listen man  no offense but i was the best  and i finished on top  i wouldnt play for this school with a 10foot pole   dean im sure troy will sign up for football  if and when some accident  damages the part of his brain that feels pride  until then would you excuse us   all right well uh if you change your mind  the field is always open  oh figuratively speaking  you know wednesdays and sundays  its used as parking overflow for the megachurch  okay    now lets meet the minimum requirements  for a

standup comedy in the 90s   im familiar with the concept im just fine  if its important to shirley ill go with her next time  im willing to try some more mainstream feminine stuff   well then you should know that nothing says im a woman  like doing it with me   nothing says im a pig like you   will they or wont they sexual tension   abed it makes the group uncomfortable  when you talk about us  like were characters in a show youre watching   well thats sort of my gimmick  but we did lean on that pretty hard last week  i can lay low for an episode    i cant count    the reasons i should stay     you sure you made the right call on the football team troy  it looks like they won something once  most valued customer henderson trophy cases   so we should still study  a little more astronomy later right  maybe over some milky ways or some mars bars   or pancakes   im jeff and im a student at greendale  thats not good   wood undergoes rapid oxidation  because it reacts spontaneously to

pleasure unit  i require a new coat of paint   just something i thought might be fun   heres something i think might be fun  lets find out the number of makeup companies  that are owned by women  ill save you the trouble its zero  but of course youre saying britta arent you a hypocrite  youre plastered with glitter and goo from head to toe  just like the rest of us  well i also pay income tax and pull over for cops  but that doesnt mean i support     thanks for offering to help design the new mascot  i uh have been a little stumped   thats no problem  by the way i took the liberty  of thumbnailing a human being prototype  which i modeled after da vincis vitruvian man   the penis is a little small i think   oh i think its oh okay  itlooks a lot like you  um heres the thing  if we are the human beings you know  and we have a mascot thats just a white guy  what message are we sending  our symbol needs to reflect the diversity of our school  and our species   soblack   no no because were not the greendale blacks  mr hawthorne or the greendale asians  or any other creed  we are the greendale human beings   yeah   sorry to disturb you guys  who are clearly looking at a naked drawing  of pierce doing jumping jacks  dean a quick download please  uh absolutely  excuse me  okay fill me in later  ah  whoaoh  ill go with a pencil   first of all  mmhmm   im flattered  oh well  youre a very photogenic man  is that real bed head or do you put something in there  can i oh its crispy   i was thinking about the four disembodied heads  and i thought wheres the heart  wheres the soul  wheres the different poster design   you know i did think those were less than personable  which is why i went with the full bodies  in these mailers we have going out   mailers i didnt give permission for this   jeffrey did you not read the release agreement  on the back of your registration form  im starting to see why someone used to be a lawyer  ha ha up top   if someone from the outside were to find  okay if someone from the outside were to find out  that i am a student at a community college  that could have a negative impact on my future career   oh goodness  look what we have stumbled onto  an opportunity to help each other out  i suppose i wouldnt need this promotional campaign  if i could announce to the press  that troy barnes is playing football here   i think hes been pretty clear  about declining that offer   i think if you said jump hed say how high  if you said stop hed say hammertime  you starting to get what i mean   no i need another example   you know i didnt realize before  but we should send those out to local businesses  hmm  law firms  lawyer  companies  legal  gatherings   are you trying to blackmail me   i think so   gentlemen  i present to you the greendale human being   thats a falcon with a gun  now its a falcon with an erection  man that backcountry today was epic  well worth the jellybeaning  blue bird day to shred some pow  you remember that freshie pillow line that we barged  i thought i was gonna squirrel out for sure  you were squirrelly all over the place  plus you didnt even see my switch back side rodeo  chill out knuckle dragger its not all about you  the dome arrives later it comes with thunder  let me tell you a little secret about me troy  every day on my way to school  i drive through downtown past the courthouse  just to get a glimpse of the world that i once ruled  and i just wanna jump out of my car  run up the steps and  exploit the legal system for profit  but i cant  im locked out of my old kingdom  youre not you see what im saying   youre saying i could be a lawyer   im saying youre a football player  its in your blood  thats racist   your soul  thats racist   your eyes  thats gay   thats homophobic  thats black   thats racist  damn   when you played you were a god  now youre not playing and youre not  id tell you to do the math but math isnt important  the only thing thats important is this   yeah but annie said   annie said that benjamin button was compelling  look shes a smart girl but sometimes shes just wrong   its like a drug isnt it  feel it troy throw it  the scoreboard lights up  there will be a scoreboard there  its complete nice catch  the girls the glory the scouts the career  it starts when you join this team   is that linebacker a pregnant woman   look you can meet them later  but this decision has to be yours tbone  and this decision has to be yes   how did you know my nicknames tbone   because youre a football player  and your name begins with t  your namebegins  with t   britta   oh are you finished  i mean i have to go  but apparently i failed yesterdays tryouts  for the position of bathroom companion   oh britta i wasnt trying to hurt your feelings   you didnt hurt my feelings shirley  i dont need to go to the bathroom with other people  i was just trying to throw you a bone because i like you   oh you can keep that bone  listening to a story about a stranger pissing me off  and taking the strangers side  and then you cant talk about your own business  but you insinuate my mamas a robot  because she and i want makeovers  that is the ladies room britta  a place where ladies go to share listen  support each other and discreetly eliminate waste  and i like you too  even like that youre a little hard  but if you cant learn to be soft in there  you need to pee alone   ive peed alone my whole life  women have always hated me  i dont even know how it started  maybe it was when i got boobs before everyb   shh shh shh  not out here  in there   whoo  ha ha troy troy the wonder boy  you dropped your books poindexter yeah   troy ive been waiting for an hour   its all right im worth it  hip hop body dont stop    troy  why are you doing a politically conservative  high school shamefully outdated fight rap  have you been playing football   threw the skin around a couple of times  still got it  eheheheh  doosh   but you knew we had an astronomy test tomorrow   class blows  what i need to know about the universe  is that im at the center of it   troy stop  dont become this person again  this isnt the real you  this is the arrogant jock  that totally ignored the only people that truly liked him  for nonsuperficial reasons  but werent allowed to say anything  because their parents are bigots   football is bad for you troy   jeff said youd say that   jeffwhat now   troy troy troy troy  thats my name   i think if we add in a little bit of phylicia rashad  well be in better shape  yeah youre right  that beige is a little light  wow   yeah yeah  we are developing the perfect mascot  no stereotypical identifiers from any race or gender   see jeff this is a chart of the features  were staying away from panasian eye folds  irish chins womens breasts   is that seal  that is our human color wheel  it goes from seal to seals teeth   what do you think   i think not being racist is the new racism   whoa whoa whoa what happened to the prototype   ooh i left the nose in the kiln   sotroy is gonna play football   yes   which means ill be getting rid of these   no i wont mail these out but they are staying with me  until the press announces that troy is a part of the team  and i want him at that pep rally tonight  reporters are gonna be there  were gonna unveil the new mascot  and things are finally going to start turning around  oh andmy extherapist  is gonna think twice before he makes fun of my job   here it is still hot   ooh ow   oh dean im gonna get some more coffee  you want anything  oh yeah a desmond tutu  with just enough cream to make it a lou diamond phillips   la bamba got it  ive been following you  how much did the dean pay you to make troy play football   im not having a conversation with someone  who emerges from a bush   because im right   no because im not in a commercial for breakfast cereal  lookthe dean has pictures of me okay  horrible pictures of me  attending his school   and for that youd convince troy  to flush his life down footballs toilet again  brittas right you are the most selfish person alive  and all that is gonna end right now  because im telling him what kind of friend you really are   maybe you should tell him  youre hopelessly in love with him  high school must have been tough huh  waiting for a superstar to notice you  but herehere hes all alone  and he needs so much help  did you enroll in all of his classes  or were you worried that might freak him out  the important thing is that you are there for him  the important thing is that you are the only one there for him  and you dont really care what he wants  just as long as you dont have to  share him with the rest of the world  because really you are just as selfish as i am  youre just not as good at it yet   youre right  i could never be as good as you  probably because i actually care   profound but technically meaningless  and dont bother trying that thing that women do  where they walk away and make the guy feel like crap  because it wont happen  yeah  damn it   shirley will you please come to the bathroom with me  wheres shirley   shirleys not coming  but im here  to listengirl   why do we inflict so much pain on ourselves  for men  i dont  knowsweetie  maybeits because men make the world go round  kleenex  ive been  infatuated with troy  now hes joining football  now hell have his pick of the litter and  ill never get to be with him    oh annie screw him  there are guys out there that would kill to be with you  and if troy isnt one of them  thats him failing your standards  you got that   youre right  i cant control him  and if i truly cared about him  i wouldnt want to  thanks for talking to me britta  it really helped  seriously   yes  whos my girl  scuse me  i did it i did it   oh yes you did  men chanting human beings human beings  human beings human beings   troy troy  dont go in there man  what   you got the most you were ever gonna get out of football  in high school  a life of disillusionment and depression  begins on the other side of that door   hey manis this your first pep rally or something   you told me  football was the most important thing in the world   well buckle up troy i was exaggerating  its kinda my gimmick let me tell you something   no let me tell you something  you know that keg flip that cost me my scholarship   yeah   i hurt myself on purpose  what   there was a scout coming to the final game at riverside  andi couldnt take the pressure  so i took the easy way out  but when you showed me that field  i saw there was nothing to worry about here  i could just play football for the fun of it  i mean have you seen these guys  there is nowhere to go but up   dude we have feelings   i dont know about you but i know i ended up here  because things werent that great out there  you should try accepting where youre at man  take a pottery class or something  greendale were number one  nancy pelosi is no fun   hey  hey  ive decided to support troy  they deploy things in football right  i went for rhyme over clarity   look im uhim really sorry about before  i just think we were both wrong   really because im an 18yearold girl  and you made me cry in public   mm okay maybe i was a little more wrong  i should grow up and make peace with being here  i mean its not like  greendales gonna kill me or anything   bluuulll  holy crap   aah  oh sorry  hey say hello to our ethnically neutral mascot  the greendale human being  the costume makes it difficult for him to see   he cant move his mouth either  but take it from me thats human for hello   lets get you into the pep rally   great idea lets do it  weve solved racism whats next   uh lets do something for little people  ooh or albinos  little albinos   this has the potential  to be a uniquely greendale experience  milady   milord
