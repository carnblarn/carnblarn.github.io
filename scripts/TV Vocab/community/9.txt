 making herself look so lovely  tell me jean  how many people bothered to tell you  how great you look today   none   man is evil   but you just said how great i looked   for my own selfish purposes  the fact is as hot as you look  and it is quite hot  i wouldnt have said anything  when i talk about people being evil  i could cite quotes or dig up statistics  but those are just words and numbers  i think we could have a little more fun  if i express myself in song   evil woman     ba na na na na     evil woman   i knew you could do it  thats my time everybody  thank you very much  yeah    at

and here i am  like a spinster librarian with my hair pulled back   yeah  what do you think  yeah   thanks   be careful abed thinks you two are gonna kiss   ridiculous   us  kissing  that is ridiculous  totally    we should get back to work   yes um okay  the people are inherently evil   ooh we can use this hobbes quote  man is a collection  of base animal urges  to act on them and experience  sinful pleasure would be morally no different  than taking a breath  thats poignant right  yeah  you know maybe we should study alone   yeah  separately   uhhuh  that way we can be more reproductiveproductive  both bye    oh you forgot your phone  well i can get another one   the next time you even see a cigarette  you will think of things that disgust you  and while youre under so deep  youll find yourself attracted  to slightly older men  perhaps some barrelchested stud  with just enough tummy to love  youll want to buy him dinner  then go back to his hot tub  perhaps youll invite one of your friends  to join us for a threeway  maybe someone with low selfesteem  and slightly larger breasts   go to hell you disgusting pig   aha   pierce i was awake the whole time  i was faking it  i know  i saw you  what do you think i am some kind of a joke   no  no i was trying to make you  feel better about yourself   how dare you pity me  i may be a little older  my ideas may seem weird  and my fashion sense may cause envy  but i have a lot to offer  and i will not be pitied    do not help me up   and as german poet franz wickmeyer once wrote  snow falls from the heavens pure  we cannot blame the snow for being  soiled by the earth    man is good       what that dude gets it   jeff winger will now offer a twominute rebuttal   hey sizzle  what are you gonna sing

would respond there is none righteous  no not one  now i realize mr simmons quote  was from the great franz wickmeyer  mine was just from a simple desert handyman  named jesus     oh thats nice   survival of the fittest wires an impulse to eliminate people  into our hearts  counterpoint   mother teresa joan of arc   rebuttal  nuclear bombs   nuclear families  abu ghraib   apu from the simpsons

it this time   chocolate pudding  huh thats new  the mural that normally resides here  is called the spirit of pawnee  and its very controversial  weve had someone throw acid at it tomato sauce  someone tried to stab it once  we really need better security here  we also need better lessoffensive history   so the city council has decided  that the spirit of pawnee should be changed  to something just a little less horrifying  now since the murals were made by government employees  back in the 1930s
