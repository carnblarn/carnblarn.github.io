look at this   is that professorson   his real name is professor woolley  and he actually does teach night school here  why would someone youve never met  pretend to be your phony professor  he was already carrying falsified faculty credentials  do you know what this means   yes you are making me do work for my fake conspiracy class   exactly theres a conspiracy here  a dark vast conspiracy  that may just go all the way to the top   this is greendale annie  if theres a conspiracy  it goes all the way to slightly below the middle   wait a minute  somethings wrong  my car wont start    hold on one second  hello    tell your little friend  to stop snooping around night school  otherwise things might get explosive   annie   whoa   you okay   yeah   probably didnt need to tackle you   probably not   looks like someone sent us a message  a tiny thoroughly underwhelming message  i hope youve already laid out your outfit  for tomorrow morning  because were going to night school   i stole these from my sons house   when does a fort stop being a fort   hey as long as its still made out of blankets  right   thesell be perfect  for the pierces mom memorial tunnel       how  bout

  i know a shortcut through the turkish district  britta   hey   go       there he is what the hells this   latvian independence parade  dont look at me they had the proper permits   dang it we lost him  luckily i sent the diorama car to the chem lab  to have the explosive analyzed   isnt that him playing the trejdeksnis   nice try woolley  now tell us everything   tell you  ha ha ha  ill show you   what is this place   this annie is night school  every student every teacher every class  figments  puffs of hot air  from the lips of a ghost  in the shadow of a unicorns dream  i made it up night school doesnt exist  i used to be a student here at greendale like you jeff  then one day i invented a fake course to get a free credit  to keep up the lie i had to create a fake teacher  who needed other fake classes  that needed to be filled with other fake students  and so on and so on and so on etchethra   did you just mispronounce et cetera   my latin class is fake jeff  like all my classes like my life  arent you listening   yeah i am  and a very familiar feeling is starting to come over me  i feel like someone is trying to teach me something   jeff the only thing  thats ever been learned in this room is regret  would that this desk were a time desk  so that i could correct my past mistakes  ride dinosaurs  fight with jack the ripper   oh wait a minute wait a minute  unicorns ghost lips time desks  doesnt any of this overly stylized garbage  remind you of anyone  everything this guy says is ripped from  the suretobeunpublished pages  of dean dangerous    i dont know what you mean   oh i think you do  by the way next time you walk someone to your fake lair  dont pass the theater department  drama professor sean garrity   whoa     thank god that character was killing me  word of advice if you ever scrape the deans car  dont tell him youre gonna pay him back in acting  on thanksgiving im supposed to crash his family dinner  and accuse him of stealing my girlfriend   wow i guess this did go all the way to the top  im calling the dean right now  and giving him a piece of my mind   no wait  garrity  does the theater department have any of those prop guns  that fire blanks   of course we just did a modern retelling of macbeth  set in gangland chicago   oh fresh take  and you think im lazy   prop guns  jeffwhat do you have in mind   a little demonstration for the dean  on the dangers of trying to educate me  he doesnt like fake classes  well hes about to get a real lesson on the fact  that jeff winger never learns   here he comes get set   you wanted to see me  oh  hi mrprofessorson   his real name is woolley  and hes defrauded your school  to a tune of dozens of credits per year  and nearly twice as many dollars   well thats serious  fortunately for you  im a big believer in second chances   im not     hey  annie  oh my god you you shot him   course i shot him he was being dishonest  and if theres one thing greendales taught me its   whoa what the hell  she had a gun   it was a fake gun we staged this  to get back at you for deceiving us   but youre the deceiver jeffrey   yeah well now youre the dead guy   jeff what are you doing  why do you have a real gun  why did you shoot the dean   well he shot you  not really  he and i were in on this from the start  when he found out you were faking a class  he came to me and we cooked up this whole conspiracy thing  to illustrate the slippery slope  of academic fraud   you know what you actually illustrated annie  how to be a crappy friend  once it was obvious  the dean had orchestrated everything  it was even more obvious  the dean was too stupid to orchestrate anything   mmhmm  so on a hunch i called him  and we hatched a plan to teach you a lesson or two  about friendship   but jeff i only did it because i love you   well when you love someone  you have to take them as they are  people arent playthings annie    no they are not   look whos talking  after everything youve put me through   okay whered you get that gun  there were only three prop guns   yeah well i live in a terrible neighborhood   annie put the gun down   after we kissed  i waited all summer to see you  youburied me  like a shameful secret   whoa   whats the matter jeff  afraid crazy annie would go crazy for you  well guess what  annies got a gun   annie just put the gun    aah aah    annie what have you done   if you love jeff winger so much  why did you conspire with me against him   i dont know  i cant keep track of any of it anymore  i just keep teaming up with whoever suggests it   glad to hear you admit it   aah aah   when i called you to ask you to doublecross annie  you didnt hesitate for a second   do you even understand what a conspiracy is  if you conspire with every person that approaches you  youre not even really conspiring with anyone  youre just doing random crap   i know i  im sorry i just  i just wanna have fun with you guys and  i go crazy cooped up in my little office and    time travel is really hard to write about     ohhhhkay  if im keeping track right we should be done  ill just take these back to the theater department   police  aah   drop your weapons  down on the ground  dont shoot officer  dont shoot please theyre fake   aah   aah    those are prop guns   well  i guess it just goes to show you  prop guns belong backstage   andscene   you have got to be kidding me   professor garrity called and told me  what all of you were up to  made me mad guns arent toys  fact in 100 of all fake gun related shootings  the victim is always the one with the fake gun  hey sean you got breakfast plans   i do now   so sean  were still on for thanksgiving right   just talk to your father craig   would that this hoodie were a time hoodie   hey dean  how bout that credit  damn it  im not sure what lessons  either of us managed to teach each other  but i am proud of annie  she took to deception like abed took to cougar town   its really good   especially when she went off script   you said to be convincing   check it out bros  you made the front page   you know what this means   weve gone mainstream   initiate protocol omega   tch       weve started looting   wanna build a cardboard submarine   get out of my brain   once  upon   a  time   there  was   a   big  spaceship   and  aliens   and  mercenaries   and  war   and  betrayal   and   romance   and  karate   and  credits   the  end   we should write a screenplay together   cool cool cool cool
