well now you love the streets  youre my ace news hound   ace you can do that   we can do anything we want its greendale  now go find me that story   this character reboot is really gelling for you jeff  that was all classic hawkeye  sending soldiers out for liquor  slyly sidestepping the problematic scrutiny  of annie hot lips edison  i should build you a still for making hawkeye martinis   of all your pop culture fixations  this is one i can work with abed   call me radar  when youve earned it  now i know the news of senor changs death  over winter break was a shock to us all  but we should take comfort in the fact  that he did not suffer  when his moped hit the side of that arbys   so sad  but best semester ever  feliz ano nueva chicas  beat it all right  that was a professional actress  i am a man who can never die  and this has been your first taste  of spanish 10 dos  the semester i get inside your cabesas        i saw that coming   hey guys see you in study group  hooah  ah   uh jeff can he really just decide hes one of us   he throws off our balance  weve got three chicks three dudes  and now two weirdos  sorry abed   not all weirdos are bad  but he might be a puckish agent of change  that changes our lives for the better  through a musical montage   or he could have a row of jars  waiting for our genitals   yo i need my genitals   you know who you guys sound like  me from last semester  cynical elitist  rakishly goodlooking  thank you   well we should at least get together  to talk about membership policies right   hey dont ask me  dealing with problems aint my job no more  my new job is hanging out having fun  and cracking wise   oh it must be nice  suppose i decide thats my job   cause youre hilarious   jeff i hope youve got an army of raisins  because ive got a major scoop  in october  there was a free toni braxton concert on the quad   you dont need to remind me   and when a lastminute mixup  shifted the show time by an hour  an anonymous text message went out  alerting students of the change   okay  not okay  because the text message was sent exclusively  to black students  and one french kid named lebron thats profiling  this is frontpage juice  just gotta find out who sent the text   have you called the number that sent it   wellnobodys that stupid right   aw  hello um  wrong number  no that that was a good cover   so whoever it is keeps hanging up  but he cant hide forever   annie the reporter good times  listen up i just want to say  thank you guys real much muchreal much duh  thank you guys very much for this  its a dream come true  oh   now lets study some spanish   so for the essay we conjugate   conjugate conjugal visit  lame  okay stick and move stick and move   okay so for the essay portion     annie got an essay portion      annie gonna move her luscious fanny      all day long     hey buddy can sing you guys  wow thats great  annies pretty young we try not to sexualize her   im sorry whoa  okay look i you know what  its your study group  and i dont know if you perceive it  as something that could be improved  but i do have some ideas  heres the one right here boom  i was thinking as a group  we could start saying you go girl  not in a way thats you know  oh im so cool saying you go girl  but in a way that were kinda winking at it  bottom line you guys need a chubby agile guy  did anyone see paul blart marl co  im like that okay  im fat and im physical okay  and im strong hmm and i can kick   oh  owoh  ooh sorry  jeff  no no its fine its fine  its just a little nosebleed  i get em when its dry  and when my face gets kicked   ill get some paper towels   did someone say something about a meeting  to discuss member policy  well i think its obvious to everyone  that this buddy fellow has a few froot loops loose  so i think no matter what we do  we gotta do it with grace and caution   i say we keep buddy in the group   what   ive given it a lot of thought and frankly  i like his inyourface style   i cant stop thinking about his high kick  his ratio of girth to hip flexibility  is mesmerizing   i like his idea of ironically saying you go girl   you go girl  you go girl   wait so you kick high enough and you get in the group   if were going to add people  i really think we should consider my friend gary   im sorry shirley  your friend gary is so boring   he was raised in finland  he doesnt get our humor   well if were gonna add a chair  for every bongripping goodtime charlie  with a song in his heart  i move we institute hazing   well in the right stuff the novel by tom wolfe   this is why we need new blood  im so bored of you pop culture references  and your cigarettelegged jeans   my friend gary wears nothing but loosefitting jeans   gary is off the table he is a buzz kill   he grew up in a land without sun   why dont you like my tight jeans   take a vote   theyll probably vote him in   they wont   guys guys lets take a vote   secret vote everybody cover your eyes   we wont know the result  well say your vote out loud   well know each others voices   troys got a point   holy crap wow  it says here some guy in seattle went nuts  and killed his entire drivers ed class  with a meat tenderizer   oh no we have to be careful   okay on the count of three  everybody who wants to keep buddy out  raise your hand   you lied about the guy in seattle  with the meat tenderizer  you put your thumb on the scale  but you did it with a smile  and you did it so you could keep smiling  youre hawkeye   and with buddy gone  staying that way will be a lot easier   i am not racist  i had 20 minutes to let people know  that toni braxton was starting early  and 273 text messages left before my rate tripled  racial profiling may not be right  but it can be economical   tell me dean when i refer to you in my article  would you prefer imbecile or incompetent   i prefer incompetent but what i really want   it doesnt matter what you want  the people want the truth i have to give it to them  and i wont let anyone stand in my way   excuse me   okay  thank you  jeffrey i am the least racist person in the world  my best friend when i was six years old was a black man  look ive learned my lesson ive got unlimited texting now  but if she runs that story i will lose this job  and this job is my life  she listens to you   well next time were both hanging out having fun  i could try cracking wise about it with her   you do what you think is right        thats enough  okay   im just saying its not exactly watergate  i mean you like the dean  hes trying to help you transfer   yeah and this time he might succeed  if this article breaks out  i can apply for journalism scholarships  nobody will care about my time in rehab  if they think im a writer   annie as your upbeat friend  i gotta say let this go   this is greendale jeff we can do whatever we want   didnt anyone tell buddy he was out   i guess we thought you would   milord milady you missed my apology song   yeah ill tell em about it later   jeff  i am so sorry about the other day   buddy yesterday the group took a vote   and you seem to have figured out the rest of it  was it the high kick was it you go girl  oh you guys think youre so cool   no we dont think were cool at all   a little bit   i put myself out there for you  i laid my soul bare  i made you guys lemon squares with freerange eggs  that i baked with my own hands   maybe a little less sugar next time   well im not leaving   oh come on be relaxed like me  leave  youre not relaxed  youre an uptight puppet master  and these are all your little puppets   buddy just be reasonable and go  make mehitler   okay so since buddys not leaving  hell just be the person who we wish wasnt here  while we study  try getting that deal from hitler shall we   im studying with you  no youre not  everyone stop studying   okay   youre not in the group   okay then go study somewhere else  hola mi amigo  donde estas la bibliota  no no no no no no  no no no  no i want to study spanish  no  noooooooooo  ah i hate you  i hate your study group i hate it  you suck aah  i hate you   and you are not running that story   why not  because i said so  does anybody have a problem with how that was handled   its exactly the way i would have done it jeff   who are you kidding abed  i just dragged a screaming crying man  out of a library with his pants down  no martinis are for hawkeyes  im the same uptight jerk i was last semester   jeff whats your favorite episode of mash   the one with uh the army   thats what i thought  if youd ever actually seen the show  youd know that hawkeye doesnt just bed nurses  and drink martinis  he also had blood sprayed on his face  and barked orders when the choppers came in  if he didnt people died  he was a leader jeff thats your job   ooh whats in it for me   hey   annie im sorry that i yelled   im glad you did  it didnt even really occur to me what i was doing  until i saw how upset you were  and i never want to be the reason youre mad  because youre jeff winger  sothanks for getting mad   well it was nothing  i guess thats the upside isnt it  thank youradar   ooh you made me so happy i just peed a little   i dont think violence is the answer  when we make decisions about   oh   hi guys   hi buddy can you um   excuse us   for one crazy stalker   listen up  we outnumber this guy six to one  annie you flash your breasts as a decoy for the bum rush   pierce  dont be upset  i didnt pick you as a decoy cause your breasts are so old   why is he even here hello   i invited him  buddys crime is thinking were cool  but i get it  i mean if i were him  and i missed out on you guys  id be sitting in that classroom  watching wondering  so how can i exclude someone from something  that im so lucky to have   oh   i say we let him in  hi buddy  welcome to the group   oh yes  you will not regret this   there he is  speak of the devil hes right there   hey buddy  hmm   the group thought about what you said  we took a vote and youre in   oh ho no way im in the cool group   look at him  its like christmas morning for the guy  welcome   ohthis is  oh this is awkward  you guys were my safe date   hey buddy you dont have to worry about them  youre with us now come on   ha ha boom   i love the kicks  hes amazing   the kicks are the best  hes just got that kind of  you know when some people have it   and that ladies and gentlemen  is why i voted to keep him   it would have been nice to have  another person in the group   ill call gary
