and you can never tell anyone okay  okay so we hooked up a few times  but theres a much larger issue here  we are friends with a grown man  that clearly believes in leprechauns  didnt we decide at the beginning of the year  that for the good of the group we wouldnt allow any intimacy  between each other or ourselves  troy we never said ourselves   okay now im really mad  so am i  now we know why our years been so horrible  its not god that hates us its jeff and britta  oh please  if we were ruining your year  why didnt you even know about it  maybe we were so distracted  by all the other

and a movie  pierce you cant sneak up on me like that  when im startled my training takes over   hello  kiyah  oh  those are just stories about us being cute  you guys actually go out of your way  to endanger the fabric of this group  yeah leave our fabric alone  you guys arent seeing the bigger picture  we compartmentalized our libidos for the good of the group  oh you compartmentalized did you  then whats been going on with us all year  what are you talking about  im talking about the annie of it all  the long looks the stolen glances  the general atmosphere of would they might they  annie i think youre reading into some things  oh really    something always brings me back to you   it never takes too long   no matter what i say or do   i still feel you here   till the moment im gone   you hold me without touch   keep me without chains   i never wanted anything so much   than to drown in your love   and not feel your rain   set me free   leave me be   i dont want to fall another moment   into your gravity   oh give me a break  i mean you could do the same thing with pierce and abed    something always brings me back to you   it never takes too long   no matter what i say or do   i still feel you here   till the moment im gone   you hold me without touch   keep me without chains   yeah but jeff lets be honest  theres more between you and annie  than there is between me and pierce   how dare you  abed its called chemistry  i have it with everybody  everybody  i havent felt any of that chemistry coming my way  i dont know if its because youre racist  or because i intimidate you sexually  but i know its one of those two  deanalingaling  i was just heading to judge our belated carnival  when i heard you guys having a tiff  whats the rumpus  we were debating how many times per year  a man can drop in a study room  in a dumb costume with irrelevant news  deanyow  its feline aids awareness day folks  so lets whip it in the keister  dean dean dean dean dean dean   dean dean dean dean   guys greendales music department is flat baroque  so we are having a fundraiser  whats dean got to do with it  why its time to tina turner the clocks ahead  happy daylight savings  deanie vidi vici  i came i saw i conquered the idea  of a free caesarsalad bar in the cafeteria  frankly my dear i dont give a dean  thats right greendale presents gone with the windows  where well celebrate our new energyconscious windows  with a cotillion  whoop  okay  well i guess we dont see our patterns  until theyre all laid out in front of us  thank you for being so nice about it  oh dean dean  can we please stop fighting  were starting to hurt innocent perverts  i dont want to stop  were airing out all this dirty laundry  after that well stop fighting forever  am i the only one that remembers  our horrible camping trip  its suhmores its not smores  i just found out about it  its pronounced smores  yeah its a contraction of some mores  so contract it  stop saying suhmores unless you can not  guys  we need to stop fighting  no we dont  its good that were finally getting all this out there  after this well stop fighting  thats what we said  when we were painting shirleys nursery  i was talking about the paint  you were being racist  hey when im being racist youll know  i know when you racist  cause youre racist every doggone day  guys lets not repeat the events of caesar salad day  aah  troy your nose is bleeding  abed stop being meta  why do you always have to take whatever happens to us  and shove it up its own ass  hes not being meta  hes just pointing out what none of us want to acknowledge  its all of us  this group is toxic  we fight about fighting about fighting   were sick  i hate us  well what do we do now  well we could do what we always do  storm out in a huff and say that the group is breaking up  troy pass me that paintbrush please  does anybody have any iodine  how many vents are you gonna crawl out of this year  thats it were done  yeah were done  see you all tomorrow  uh you guys wait i want to say something  you dont have to save us with a speech  were not breaking up  so we dont need to get back together  i know i dont have to but i want to  look weve known each other for almost two years now  and yeah in that time  ive given a lot of speeches  but they all have one thing in common  theyre all different  these drug runners arent gonna execute pierce  because hes racist  its a locomotive that runs on us  and the only sharks in that water  are the emotional ghosts that i like to call fear  anchovies fear  and the dangers of ingesting mercury  because the real bugs arent the ones in those beds  and theres no such thing as a free caesar salad  and even if there were  the cape still might find  a second life on cable  and ill tell you why  el corazon del agua es verdad  that water is a lie  harrison ford is irradiating our testicles  with microwave satellite transmissions  so maybe we are caught in an endless cycle  of screwups and hurt feelings  but i choose to believe its just the universes way  of molding us into some kind of supergroup  like the traveling wilburys  yes troy like the traveling wilburys of pain  prepared for any insane adventure life throws our way  and i dont know about you  but im looking forward to every one of them  oh jeffrey  oh jeff  jeffrey jeffrey  well i guess we can get through anything  so its probably okay  if you and britta want to keep you know hooking up   i dont mind it so much  im cool with it   god cares  whatever  have fun tonight  so  i guess we dont have to keep sneaking around anymore  yeah i guess not  you want to stop doing this   yeah yeah  yeah   its not you its me  its you  hey guys  hey guys ooh  hey you guys remember the time   those guys dont care who they hurt do they  you know i still dont even know if im in the group  hey  you and i have had some pretty good times huh  ow ow  aah ow ow  what a year  ow ow  aah aah aah  ow  i care about you guys  shut up dean you dress in stupid outfits  well you have a right to your opinion  so ill just leave  you could have been nicer to the dean just then jeff  so what i dont care  i just think there maybe could be repercussions yo  i dont care what you think  i dont care about repercussions  and i dont care about the dean  okay  meanwhile at that same moment  a truck full of toxic waste crashes and spills on the dean  transforming him into megadean  i dont care about anything  wait i care now now i care  i owe you guys an apology  the dean runs our school  hes entitled to a modicum of respect  youre always so mean to him why  its embarrassing to admit  but sometimes i felt jealous of his interesting outfits  jeffrey if i didnt know better  id say you had a crush on him  ill never tell
