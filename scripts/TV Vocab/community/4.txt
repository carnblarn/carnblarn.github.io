                 before we wrap up i would like to thank you guys  for filling out these anonymous evaluation cards  i found your feedback  to be largely constructive and flattering  so gracias on that  de nada   you dont have to sign your name anymore   got it   but there was one evaluation  that was so harsh and hurtful  and racist  that i took the time personally  to analyze that handwriting against past exams  and this particular coward  dots her is with tiny  ittybitty little circles  boop boop tcch  isnt that precious and cute  whos erratic and unstable now  princess gringa     nice day out today isnt it   yeah shoot   you forget something  yeah  i forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with shirleys  we both have a class across campus and i cant go  that kind of distance with ooh thats nice   thats mean  no   thats not nice   i find shirley very easy to talk to  and besides arent you supposed to have  like an olympic gold medal in jibberjabber   yeah but im a sprinter  im at my best during highspeed bursts of wit  on a shirley walk id be winded by that stoner tree   hey britta hi whats up   hey vaughn hows it going  no worries   interesting cause i might be worried  if i was playing hacky sack a decade too late   my class is that way   all right but i just wanted to point out  that we easily walked more than 100 yards  with no awkward pauses  and that is the sign of a true friend   im really glad that youre not hitting on me anymore   theres the awkward pause   huhhaah aw   excuse me oh sorry ladies  professor duncan professor duncan   what  excuse me annie edison  im in your 101 lecture  hello   ive heard about your special psych lab   ah the duncan principle  yes  and i know its limited to secondyear students  but i had a 40 at riverside high  and im not looking down on this school at all  but im only here because of a brief addiction to pills  that i was told would help mefocus  but they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity  so  right   if you would let me take your lab early  it would be a real feather in my transcript   okay ive actually been in this situation many times  so im just going to be up front  im not allowed to date students   oh   even though youre an eight   oh  which is a british ten  so im angry  oh   but if in spite of that you are still interested  then you may join the lab     ah okay you need to bring two human subjects  and it would not hurt your chances one bit  if you could lend me a fiver  i seem to have left my purse in my duffle  and my duffle in the boot of my lorry so   oh   i asked politely and then panda took his pants off     i never even knew thats what asexual meant   i wonder what this express package could be  somebody had to get something to me very fast   you brought your mail to campus   oh yes my earnoculars   what is that it looks like your bluetooth thingie   no no no no no this is my cell phone headset  and this is earnoculars  its for spies and whatnot it gives you sonic hearing   all hearing is sonic  whats that   so who wants to be in a psych experiment   hey guys guys guys  annie is talking about some kind of experiment   shes behind you not

attention to the monitor  you will see that our subjects  are waiting for the experiment to begin but  its actually happening right now     wow  you see the waiting is the experiment  the duncan principle is simple  namely that the more control lost by the  yeah im gonna write this down too actually  thats a good point  the more control lost by the ego  the more gained by the id  resulting in a surprisingly predictable  emotional eruption or breaking point  known to ma and pa as a good oldfashioned tantrum    oh  annie why dont you uh go and tell our subjects  that were going to be starting the experiment  in five minutes okay  and annie  its never actually going to start  ho ho  lets do this     hi everyone  hi troy  hi abed  hi  hi senor chang   what a community college
