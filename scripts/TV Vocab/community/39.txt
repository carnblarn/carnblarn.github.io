                gather close that you might hearken  the story of fatneil  born stout of heart but large of bone  his adolescent years were shadowed  by scorn and mockery  hey fatty fatty  hey fatty fatty  outlets of fantasy afforded him  some escape from the darkness throughout high school  and as a man he traveled far to a new school  and a new beginning  or so he thought  yeah its down by fatneil  the name became a joke  ill have what fatneils having  the joke became his life  yes fatneil  and neil fell again into darkness  only this time his thoughts turned to an escape  of which we dare not speak  but pain need not be spoken to be known  not to all  it was strangely jeff the liar  son of william the barely known  who first became concerned  neil  it was jeff who pretended to be interested  in dungeons  dragons  in an effort to lift neils spirits  and when jeffs fake interest  resulted in neil giving jeff all his books  explaining he wouldnt need them anymore  it was annie the dayplanner  herself a recovering head case  that recognized the signs of coming doom  a council was called  troy the obtuse  shirley the cloying  abed the undiagnosable  julian assange is a modern day  and britta the needlessly defiant  for reasons that should be obvious  pierce the insensitive  known also as pierce the dickish  and grandpa the flatulent  was not invited  the group agreed that what fatneil needed most  was to feel like a winner for a change  they would invite neil that saturday  to a game of dungeons  dragons  designed by abed to help neil reclaim his confidence  for neil  at the end of the meeting  they realized that chang had been there  and felt too awkward to mention it  what they couldnt have known  was that they had just scheduled  the most important game of dungeons  dragons ever  a game which not only might save a life  but which would forever change the balance  between good and pierce  viva portaje  hi  hey neil  this is gonna be awesome yo  so were just gonna ignore that hate crime huh  im a dark elf or a trau  shouldnt you be wearing armor or something  im an elf not a nerd  so you guys suddenly just  wanted to play dungeons  dragons  yyeah  wwhy wouldnt we  yes  its cool and when you play it  it makes you happy  like a dragon  okay hi  i am your dungeon master  we will be playing this adventure  the cavern of draconis   ooh  neil  i understand neil has his own character  named duquesne that hes been playing for years  so i made these for you guys  now take your time choose your character carefully  they each have their own unique combination of strength and  all righty  shouldnt there be a board or some pieces  or something to jenga  no no this is a roleplaying game  it takes place entirely in our collective imagination   ooh  neil  i tell a story  and you make choices in the story okay  lets begin  you are all standing on a country road  legend has it the evil dragon draconis  dwells nearby guarding a massive pile of treasure  working as a team  your goal is to track down the dragon kill him  and then claim the treasure as your own  jeff your turn  oh its my turn  oh um what do i do roll dice  you tell me what you want to do  then i roll the dice to see if youre successful  what are my choices  okay youre slowing things down jeff  shirley what do you want to do  id like to introduce myself to the group  hello i am a dwarf named zippitydo  okay im not the best at making up names  oh hey im marrrrrr  boy you werent kidding  hello marrrrrr  my name is bing bong the archer  im an archer and such  imew hector the wellendowed abed  i didnt know youd just grab one at random  i made that one with troy in mind  yeah i bet you did  okay hi im lavernica  i have three armors  boots  a belt  a torch  wait let her finish  worst introduction ever check it  i am brutalitops  the magician  magic user baby what  an arrow flies through the air almost hitting brutalitops  six goblins are running toward you  from the tree line drawing daggers  oh  i attack them using my  additional notes  it has no effect britta  i want to know why these goblins are attacking us  maybe these woods are their rightful land  and from their perspective  youre the att of people  youve been shot by an arrow  yeah it hurts jeff  uh i take my throwing knife  and throw it knifestyle  you do ten points of damage  look at that   what am i not good at  sex  but the goblins close in surrounding you on all sides  i draw my plusthree sword of duquesne  and attack in a 180degree arc  the goblins are terrified as duquesne draws  his powerful glowing sword from its sheath  and in one move slices the throats of three charging goblins   oh  oh thats good  the rest of the goblins run away  great job with the sword neil you saved us  what would we have done if you didnt exist  dial it back lavernica  pierce what are you doing here  how about you answer that question  what the hell is this little tea party  were playing dungeons  dragons  first of all gay  second of all stupid  and thirdly  why was this a secret  are you cutting me out of the group  i guess we must have forgot   mmhmm  yeah thats what it was  but you remembered to invite al jolson here  and you remembered to let fatty sit in my chair  get out youre stretching it  pierce can we talk to you outside for a second  kind of missed that opportunity already didnt you  yeah but theres a very specific reason  lets just play all right  i dont have a character for you  i dont care i just want to play the game   i dont need a character  i think you do  just put me in the stupid game now  okay um  as you watch the goblins retreat  you notice a 67yearold naked man with no weapons  lying in the wet grass shivering  his name is  pierce hawthorne and im 66 dick  in about 13 turns he will die of exposure   jeff  i wait 14 turns  screw you guys im gonna win  i go to the naked man and i give him my cloak  oh  pierce i am duquesne of clan duquesne  dumb name  im gonna take his sword can i take his sword  youve got his sword  pierce knock it off youre playing the game wrong  well see  okay i take the duquesne sword from the naked man  i attack him i attack black face  its a critical hit  youve decapitated him brutalitops is dead  what  no  chang  im afraid im gonna have to ask for your character sheet   still your turn  i run  what you run  the naked man is running into the woods   but he has my sword  can we catch him please  well the cloak that duquesne gave him  was an elven cloak of windwalking  which is double speed so no hes gone   damn it  it took me ten years  and 50 campaigns to get that sword  really  maybe ill wipe my ass with it and throw it off a cliff  thats for sitting in my chair fatty  i take it that means im winning  pierce youve made your point  you can ruin anything  now come back and give neil his sword  i cant hear you over the sound  of me rubbing his sword on my balls   pierce  ew  you have  successfully rubbed your balls on the sword  abed dont help him  youre the dungeon master just kill pierce  and give neil back his sword hes upset  im the dungeon master i have to be impartial  or the game has no meaning  can you just give neil a new sword  that sword is one of a kind  it was forged by my ancestors  i hump it  thats it pierce abed  i need to talk with you in the hall  what hey   hey  that kid in there  is severely depressed  oh yeah is that what he told you  from the looks of it hes been using that line  since he was five years old to get an extra slice of pie  what the hell is wrong with you  i dont like being excluded jeff   do you  yes  now go in there and tell him youre giving him his sword  or you are out of the study group  im sick of you threatening me  and talking to me like a kid  and giving me that look you give me  like i cant get erections  what   abed i keep running  okay  but since youre working against the group  i need to separate you from them  good who wants to sit with a bunch of fat crybabies anyway  call me when youre ready for my next move  pierce refuses to give back the sword  our new goal is to find him and kill him  i think i just want to go home  neil do not do that  were gonna get that sword back okay  now is there a way of moving faster than hes moving  in his cape of whatever  i guess if we had a pegasus  if thats sarcasm i cant tell  because everything in this game is silly  um abed can we get a pegasus  i cant give you information like that  well theres got to be a town nearby  we will go to that town and ask around  about a pegasus  huzzah  is that right  and so it was that the group  began to describe themselves walking  and as they described themselves walking  so did abed confirm that they walked  i walk with them  until  this is a local elf tavern but all races are welcome  aw  okay its a crowded and rowdy evening  beleaguered gnomes hurry to and fro  with glasses of mead for the thirsty elves  beleaguered why are they beleaguered  who cares  i find a waiter and introduce myself  argy bargy arg barg barg   why is he a pirate  hes a gnome   he only speaks gnome  anybody here speak gnome  oh i do lavernica does  oh thisll be painless  hello my friend and brother  how can i help you dear madam  oh please no need for such deference  i am no better than a gnome  yes you are madam  you are a human warrior  which is five species classes greater than i  thats disgusting dont talk like that  i am so sorry madam  please dont report me for execution  oh no no no i didnt mean that  guys we have got to do something about these gnomes   um  britta ask the stupid gnome  where we can get a pegasus  did someone say pegasus  a word i understand in every language  okay heres all  the dungeons  dragons stuff i could find  i had to carry it all the way from my car  its very heavy and my doctor said  ahh  following the directions given to you by the gnome   you arrive at a field full of majestic pegasi  finally  but they are guarded  by a mysterious and beautiful elf maiden  who seems drawn to marrrrrr  oh okay well i explain that we need a pegasus  and uh i dont know  promise to fill it up before we bring it back  she flirts with you   i flirt back  how   i say something sexy  like what  abed  okay  excuse me i dont normally do this  but youre the most beautiful creature ive ever seen  and i would really love a pegasus   ugh  works for me  youre very handsome you know  yeah  well you know im not really comfortable with this  my stable has a bedding of heather  perhaps youd be more comfortable indoors  abed try to look at what youre doing  and understand that i dont want to  youve offended the elf maiden  she seems disinterested in doing business with you today  what  all right come on can we just do this  hi hello i am hector the wellendowed  youve got a bunch of pegasi lets make a deal  what kind of deal  all right i take her by the hand  and lead her to the stable  i light a candle and rip off a piece of my tunic  which i fashion into a blindfold   oh hector but i dont know  shh shh  i place it gently over the elf maidens eyes  okay you both fall back exhausted but still entwined  okay great i stroke her hair lovingly  and spoon her for the appropriate amount of time   before leaving  how long is that  cool cool cool  all right the elf maiden thoroughly satisfied  promises you a flock of pegasi  oh excellent  you guys can take a break i should check on pierce  pierce  im here  i need to know what you want to do next  so many things abed  so many things  guys  i am bringing pierce back into the room  because while soaring above the forest of ingold  you spot his body in an elven cloak in a clearing below   ha  ooh  we got you dummy  we land  you land safely in the wooded clearing  he is facedown barely moving  a pool of blood underneath him  i cant tell you how long  ive dreamed of this moment in the game  uh neils sword  clutched in the right hand of the body  is the sword of duquesne  sir i believe this is yours  thank you jeff  once you get close enough to take the sword  you can see that this body  while definitely dying is not pierce  what  i turn it over  its the gnome waiter from the tavern  what no why  goodbye my friend  thank you for being so respectful toward me  who did this to you gnome waiter  i never saw his face  just so you know  my name  was kyle  kyle  britta  he was an imaginary waiter  i wouldnt expect you to understand  now  you hear a low rumble on the other side of the tree line  followed by a shrill screech  and the beating of heavy wings against the sky  wait wings  whats going on  tell me abed are you familiar  with the amburg region of the edylmann river basin  of course i am  then youll know theres a reflecting pool  with a very special amulet at the bottom of it  an amulet that allows the wearer  full control over  draconis  the hideous draconis an allpowerful red dragon  crashes through the trees into the clearing  riding atop his shoulders  naked as the day he was born  and controlling draconis with the amulet is  say it  pierce hawthorne  scream what i told you to scream  pierce hawthorne is my master  prepare to meet your doom  i run towards pierce with my broadsword drawn   and i attack his  time stop  time stop  draconis has tons of spells  the six of you are completely frozen and helpless  this is why i wanted to play chutes and ladders  fine pierce you win  just kill us and end this  oh no killings too good for you  cast shape change on duquesne  what shape do you

at the amulet  around the sad naked mans neck  thats a difficult shot youll need an 18 or higher  oh sweet baby jesus  yeah  yes in your face  the sword smashes the amulet  freeing draconis from its spell  the red dragon turns his head grabs pierce in his mighty jaws  and swallows him alive   oh no  oh neil  as a reward for freeing him  he flies your intrepid band to his cavern  where he bestows his treasure upon you  congratulations on the completion  of cavern of draconis  ive been your dungeon master   i hope you had a good time  whoo  excelsior  hey  that was the best game i ever played

could you possibly want giant ears over a tail  if you had a tail people could always tell when youre happy  yes but with giant ears  you could hear things from miles away  and you could wear backpacks as earrings  which would free up your hands  backpacks already free up your hands  guys what do you think  we thought our group was meeting now  tail is much better  thank you  all in favor of giant ears  mm told ya  viva portaje
