                its that very special time of year greendale  a time for me to remind you  that your school acknowledges no specialness  to this time of year  you do of course have a constitutional right  to lend this season  the significance of your choosing  in any of our designated holiday zones  merry christmas everybody  dont you mean seasons greetings  come on shirley you know its christmas  yes but as a modern christian  ive learned to be sensitive  to other cultures jealousies  so what are we doing this year  well im taking a relaxation course  next semester  and i was going to use the break  to do all the reading in advance  im shutting myself in with my video games  fakemurdering people is gonna be  my new holiday tradition  hm this is disappointing  what do you care about christmas abed  youre muslim  dont your people spend this season  writing angry letters to tv guide  its true religiously im muslim  but ive always been a big fan of christmas  and this is the most important christmas  in the history of the universe  im assuming thats why were all stopmotion animated  i vote we let it go  what did you say we were abed  were stopmotion animated  i dont understand what hes saying  i never understand what any of you are saying  you guys dont see it  i noticed it this morning  thats how i knew it was a special christmas  weve clearly entered a whole new medium  abed does the word clearly mean the same thing  to you as it does to normal people  its probably arabic for not clearly  you really expect me to tarnish the high five  for that  you guys really dont see what im seeing  that worries me a little  i think it worries all of us  is there something that we can do  to help you with your situation abed  for starters you could move around more  not much point in being animated  if you dont  and i think we should commit to the format  starting with a song  you start im sure well join in   give me the snow  light up the trees  deck every hall  and while you can see  roast every nut  mistle the toe  this needs to be the best christmas  since the original   theyll say  the most successful christmas  was today   okay we got him  we got him hes down  now how many fingers am i holding up  and more importantly  are they still made of clay  three and i told you were not clay  were silicone dolls with foam bodies  over ballandsocket armatures  fascinating  and publishable  and you say you have no memory  of this morning  you dont recall the emotional crisis  that caused you to take shelter  in this delusion   its not a delusion  very very publishable  abed ive been a professor of psychology  here at greendale for many years  and i think i see a solution to this  that might also help you with your situation  id like to do extensive sessions with you  including hypnosis   i dont need therapy  nobody said you did  i just think it would benefit you  and incidentally me  to get to the real meaning of all this  youre right thats it  i need to find the meaning of christmas  ah well  if i can find the meaning of christmas  everything will go back to normal  asterisk  abed the dean says  if you dont get help  they might kick you out of school  why would i want to be in a school  that hates christmas  hes got a point  kidding   sad quick christmas song  sad quick christmas snowman  tragic day gone wrong  sad quick christmas song   i dont suppose you know the meaning of christmas  lonely snowman  apparently it means getting fondled  by singing mental cases  my snowman is alive  im not a snowman  im chang  what the hells wrong with you today  i thought i made you  yeah you made me need to cry  in the shower tonight  its a text from britta  she says the meaning of christmas  is in the study room  hey now that

leaving the floor  as the walls and the ceiling fly away  were in outer christmas space  theres planet holly  and planet jolly  oh and whats that up ahead  ah its planet abed  subtle  yeah were actually descending  onto planet abed now  its the most christmassy planet in the universe  its atmosphere is 7 cinnamon   were here winter wonderland  see how sparkly  what are you crazy all i see is

call it a shortcut  but you got us here so ill throw you a bone   come with me  and walk with me  and see what we can find   accompany me  on a journey with me  through the wonderland  in my mind   lets move folks  this isnt going to be fun easy or safe  shut up winger  mmhmm  fair warning guys  a journey through winter wonderland  tends to test your commitment to christmas  and when i say test i mean wonka style  im talkin dark  stay honest stay alert  and for the love of god  stay between the gumdrops  look up there abed  i think i see the cave of frozen memories  a great place  its actually the cave of frozen peas  its a common mistake  dont worry christmas wizard  i got this  terrific  abed did you say my christmas self  was a baby  are you sure you didnt say i was a christmas angel  i think that must be what you said right  because you respect me too much  to imagine me as a baby  jeez maybe if you cry enough hell change you  uh you do know why he said you were a robot right  because im progressive and kick ass  how bout heartless and godless  i think he just gave us random identities  you guys  i mean me a ballerina  its not like im that thin and graceful  right  annie its because youre fragile and tightly wound  oh  ladies cut the nonthematic chatter  and keep your eyes on the prize  were looking for the meaning of christmas  uh you know what abed  i happen to know the meaning of christmas  and im pretty sure im the only one here that does  so i would appreciate a certain level of respect  even if i am a guest  in your makebelieve therapy wonderland   therapy  all right  i am freezing shirley with my wand  and i am ejecting her from planet abed  with a remote control christmas pterodactyl   oh nice  now were talking  the point being if youre not interested  in helping abed  theres no reason to be here  cookies   swaddled in her diaper  high upon her throne  the queen of christmas babies  thought that christmas was her own   thats wonderful  lets get back to the magic journey  and wrap up  some of us have women to sleep with  you guys hear that  humbugs   humbugs  yeah a whole swarm of them  see  everyone stay perfectly sincere  humbugs are attracted to sarcasm  wow  somewhere out there tim burton just got a boner  jeff dont be sarcastic  oh are they on me now  oh no  theyre eating him alive  if only he could find the power  to not be a smug douche  ah no can do  im just a horrible guy  guess ill have to go get laid  ooh can i sing this one  bitter shallow hipster  sweater matching socks  christmas needs more presence  than a haircut in a box  annie nice  get what i did with the word presence  this is carol canyon  instead of oxygen  the plants produce christmas songs  will it cost a lot to walk through here  no no its public domain  you guys know jesus was born  in the middle of april right  the church moved his birthday to december  so they could steal the solstice  from the pagans  seasons greetings from britta perry  maybe you could sing a song about it britta  i dont sing  and if i did i wouldnt sing christmas songs  i guess that means youre gonna have me ejected  from winter wonderland  for not loving christmas enough  nope not for that  lets get to the cave of frozen memories  man it is cavelike in here  what do you mean cavelike its a cave  nothing to be afraid of  the cave of frozen memories is a safe place  where we can observe suppressed experiences  without being affected by them  can you show me how to do it  sure  here im focusing on a part of the cave  and im seeing my tenth christmas  all right  now you try with this morning  i cant see your tenth christmas  how do you even know thats you  well its my house on 52nd street  in islington  what room are you in what color are the walls  our living room  creamcolored plaster  theres an oil painting of a forest  above the sofa  im reading paddington books  mom got me paddington every year  wheres your dad  its christmas professor  where is your dad  i dont know we never know  mom wont stop crying  im going to america with grandma  he is good  we lost our wizard  we dont need him never did  and nobody needs this cave  initiate selfdestruct  selfdestruct initiating  this slide goes directly to pine tree station  we can catch a train to the north pole from there  the wizard didnt bring us here  to find the meaning of christmas  and i cant have anyone going beyond this point  thats on his side  with you to the end man  always  like i said i came for the cookies  ouch  im not ejecting you  for your not liking christmas music britta  im ejecting you for lying  to trick me into therapy  abed they will kick you out of school  i was trying to save you   brittabot  programmed badly  wires with fraying ends  functioning  mad and sadly  no faith in herself  or friends  bye britta  damn it got real up in that memory cave  i know right  speaking of real this has been great  but the cookies are gone  and i have to take a giant leak  we should be at the north pole   you guys see the countryside  theres the menorah mountains  and jehovah witness bay  thanks for adding that man  this is nicer than all the christmases  i ever celebrated  but youre jewish  on my moms side  but my dads episcopalian  and before the divorce  the holidays were a minefield of overlapping rituals  i like the rituals  my parents are divorced too  my moms polish  she loves christmas  every year she visits on the same day  december 9th  and every year we sit and watch  rudolph the rednosed reindeer together  every year  but abed today is december 9th  its the last day of classes  yeah  that cant be right  she comes every year  today must be december 8th  cause she comes every year  okay abed  time to stop the train  after you emasculated me in the ice caves  i went to your dorm room  i know what happened now  it doesnt matter  i just need to get to the north pole  abed there is no north pole  were in the library study room  and im not a christmas wizard  i know  youre a christmas warlock  youre trying to destroy christmas  because you blame your sadness on it  im crawling out the window  no youre not  snap out of it  whoa whoa who taught you therapy  michael jacksons dad  i am a professional  and you are tampering  with a highly delicate book deal  i mean human being  oh now were losing him  im on the roof of the train  oh great  well im teleporting there  because i can do that  cause im a wizard  bloink  abed there is no train  this is not real  i cant hear you  im going to the front car  youre very clever  but it stops here  theres no more journey  its just you against reality  and reality always wins  abed  im unhitching the cars okay  what oh give me a break  do you know what youre doing  bloink were learning to teleport  and were helping our friend find the meaning  of christmas  hey youre actually grabbing me  in real life delinquent  well keep him away abed  go  find the meaning of christmas  at the very least  somebody take notes  whoof all right where are we  christmas train  i didnt wanna go home  its depressing there this time of year  what are we looking at  santas workshop  okay  so meaning of christmas right  you see it   well can it just be anywhere  likethere  good job pierce  its the first season of lost on dvd  thats the meaning of christmas  no its a metaphor  it represents lack of payoff  correct  thinking there was something you could do  to save christmas  turning yourself into an animated character  in search of the holidays meaning  these were mechanisms you used to escape this  this christmas card  left where you dropped it  on the floor of your dorm  abed  i cant make it this year  i have a new family now  youll meet them one day  youre a man now  take care of dad  wash your dupa  mommys moved on  new family  new life  theres nothing left to do now  but heal  and share the experience  with as many reputable journals as possible  great  look what you did to the kid  whats your article gonna be called  worst shrink ever  hey this is not my fault  this is what christmas does to people  we put too much meaning into it  and it lets us down  we beg to differ  what are you doing back here  saving christmas  everybody point your magic christmas weapons at him  oh brother  this is ridiculous  you are enabling a delusion  the delusion youre trying to cure  is called christmas duncan  its the crazy notion  that the longest coldest darkest nights  can be the warmest and brightest  yeah and when we all agree to support each other  in that insanity  something even crazier happens  it becomes true  works every year  like clockwork  try telling that to your catatonic friend  i got a better idea  why dont we sing it   wait what  yeah lets not go overboard  will you two commit to something for a change   lets sing it  yeah lets sing  can we sing while we blow duncan away  absolutely  ow ah ah  you start britta   christmas time is a time to sing  thats what christmas is for   christmas can even be a hanukkah thing  thats what christmas is for   and for a huge percentage  of this godfearing planet  its about the birth  of jesus chriiist   but for the rest of us  its still a good time  to remember that its good to be nice   music and cookies and licorice dreams  thats what christmas is for   video games for two straight weeks   thats what christmas is for   hey not the face   hanging out with the people you love   and saying i love you   thats what christmas is  thats what christmas is  thats what christmas  is for  andchristmas pterodactyl  all right all right im leaving  initiate selfdestruct  dont you think thats a little bit  i get it  the meaning of christmas is  the idea that christmas has meaning  and it can mean whatever we want  for me it used to mean being with my mom  now it means being with you guys  thanks lost  wow  i feel so much better now  i guess we dont need to be stopmotion anymore  well why not just keep it going  for the rest of christmas  it just feels so right  you ever get the urge to just  merry christmas  ah there  said it  were stopmotion again  oh dont worry man i did this   you did  yeah its cool  oh why  well i always liked the way fake food looked  on those animated shows  i mean get a load of these things  they really stepped up a notch  in terms of visual deliciousness  i know what you mean  look at that perfect bite  its a little odd that i see this too though  dont you think  yeah were weird that way  ah thats better  so weird  troy and abed in stopmotion
