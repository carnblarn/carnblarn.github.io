                does anyone know how long it takes papiermache to dry  three hours longer  than it took duncan to think up this assignment  i think s really gonna appreciate  the extra work we did expanding our evolutionary chart  oh britta can you hold up the final stage of humanity  i still think that man is going to evolve into woman  not dragon monster with three legs  three legs  well its been real  at least the paste smell has  but i have a date to catch  or should i say a catch to date  oof hope you just come up with that  look out driveby deaning  kidding  just a nonviolent verbal reminder  the local shelter is having a puppy parade this afternoon  ohh  oh i want to lick it  i expect all of you to lend a paw  except you jeffrey  i know youve gotta catch to date  oh like youre famous for your wit  puppy parade  i am in  want to see if those wiener dogs are born that way  or if they start off normal and then get wiener  abed did you pick up my pen  its a purple pen with a gel grip  nope im strictly mechanical pencils these days  more relatable  it was just here  you okay annie chocolate  would you like me to push you to the parade pierce  oh no thanks  i dont want people think of me as a handicap  if anything this chair makes me more than a human  you move it by blowing into this uh tube here  its the most expensive one  i outbid three hospitals for this baby  and it was worth every penny  oh  oh  wait please just wait  im sorry but i need to know who took my pen  uh  sorry i dont see it  yeah sorry annie  no  not sorry annie  we passed sorry annie eight pens ago  i keep bringing pens and you guys keep taking them  and im afraid i am putting my foot down  okay well now annie has made it clear  that this is an issue  so from now on we need to be more respectful of her things   okay  cool  all right its not on the floor  so whoever accidentally took not accidentally  accidents dont just happen over and over and over again okay  this isnt budget daycare  okay whoever insidiously  and with great malice aforethought  abducted annies pen  confess repent and relinquish so we can leave  maybe nobody took it  sometimes i think i lost something  really important to me  and it turns out i already ate it  i didnt eat my pen troy  i know i brought it and now its gone  i took a photo  aha  aha im zooming  see see  i took this ten minutes ago  my pen was on the table  no one has come in or out since  one of you has my pen right now  annie  its a pen  its not a pen  its a principle  not a good time to get a stick of gum okay  are we going to the puppy parade or not  because this is starting to feel like a bottle episode  again with the tv crap  hey meatball did you take annies pen  to make life more like benny hill or whatever you do  abed  i wouldnt do that i hate bottle episodes  theyre walltowall facial expression and emotional nuance  i might as well sit in the corner with a bucket on head  well i have a photography project to finish  and my grandmothers hands  arent going to take closeups of themselves  hasta la later  hmm  was that hmm directed at me  if the hmm fits  i dont have your pen annie  im always lending you supplies  you never come prepared  if its so important to you here have my pen  thats my pen  well whatever people  theyre just things  since theyre just things  i dont suppose youd mind letting us  take a quick looksee inside your bag  oh id very much mind annie  as a quick invasion of civil liberties  oh man  oh it all starts with a quick looksee into someones bag  and then its a brisk peekaroony  at our phone records  and before you can say 1984 the thought police  are forcyworcing you to bend and spread  bend and spread  are the thought police gonna make love to us  do they find thoughts in our butts  i knew i should have read that book  britta stop using the constitution  as a baby blanket  last week she invoked the freedom of information act  to request photocopies of my notes  thats pretty good  well excuse me for living free  come on stoney we all know the pens in your bag   yeah come on  come on dump it  happy  not if thats a used qtip   eww  oh  welcome to the gross business of martial law  welcome to what used to be individuality  seized and disintegrated by cowardly groupthink  welcome my friends welcome to the machine  well annie it looks like you were wrong  britta does come prepared for one thing  or six   big weekend  cant complain  razzle pzazzle  attention students  the puppy parade is starting on the quad  better come quick  with every passing moment these puppies grow older  and less deserving of our attention  whoa whoa whoa  where do you people think youre going  uh have you ever gone  to a puppy parade halfway through britta  it is pointless  then you clearly stole the pen  the patriot act cuts both ways  actually its pretty onesided  thats kind of the point  heres my point  whoevers the pen thief is just stood there  and watched me get guantanamoed  and id like to know who it is  so i can let them know that they have lost my trust forever  its a bottle episode  britta were sorry we embarrassed you  and looked at your prophylactic equipment  your lifestyle mistakes are none of our business  oh thanks shirley  but now lets rustle through your tampons and wallet  so we can apologize to you  oh im sure everybody here knows that i dont steal  have you checked your bag shirley  if you took it by mistake i forgive you  oh so if i took it its larceny  but if you find it under mother hen its a mistake  mother hen i think were about the same age  sure unless time is linear  ill make your ass linear  that doesnt make any sense  ill make ya ass sense  girls dont get your panties puckered  we all know what were really thinking  if and i mean if the culprit is among us  statistically speaking its troy  yes we were all just thinking that in 1856   what if a ghost took the pen   please forgive him  for what  for stealing the pen dummy  why would i take her pen  i dont even like having my own  its probably under one of pierces casts  he uses everything to itch his legs  were on our third dvd remote  if i took the pen id say so  you probably forgot  youve been popping painkillers like tictacs  oh yeah right  side effects verbal dysphasia  and octopus loss  i dont see anything on this squirrel about memory troy  now i want to know who has it  yeah nice try shirley  that doesnt take you off the list  jeff youre in charge  i demand you deal with this  theres nothing to deal with  ill say  ok alright alright  everyone breathe   you know what this is  yep  shut up this is a normal day  with a bunch of friends who are done studying  and a pen that maybe rolled away   rolled away  or fell down someones shoe   lets check shoes  annie  fine fine  someone in this room is hiding your pen  want to know why  they feel terrible  they made a mistake  they waited too long come forward  and now they feel bad   they should  mmhmm  okay okay so pen thief  we understand what happened  and we forgive you   if you confess and apologize  yes  right but heres the trick  because this person now has no reason  not to come forward  if by some chance i get to the count of three  and nobody comes forward guess what  we have to accept that no one has the pen dont we  dont we  good so here we go  one  two  pierce you have something to tell us  yes is it me  or has it become really obvious that jeff took the pen   yes  definitely  you want to make a bet you jerks  lockdown abed seal the doors  nobody leaves until this pen shows up  i dont like this  yeah tell it to the pen you might have  gwynnifer hi yeah its me  i cant make it  well tell your disappointment to suck it  im doing a bottle episode  okay  you just became my hero  thank you  no pen  i can see that  why do you keep taking that tone with me  oh ill field that  because if nobody else has this pen  it means at so point you realized you had it  and were too embarrassed to say and we get to kill you  im not hiding my own pen you paranoid weirdo  everybody stay within each others eyelines please  one of yous a monster   me next right  hold on  can we please consider  the threshold that we are crossing  we dont trust abed  he shredded my backpack  he freed my pet monkey  because we corrupted him  hes our innocent  he put gum in your hair  empty the bag abed  uh pierce   you dont have a bag   giraffe  uh jeff you dont have a bag  oh i could never deprive the world  of the portion of my chest the strap would cover  makes sense so whats left  shirley a little hugging and crying and then were done  wait abed why is my name in here  thats mine  and shirleys and annies  what is it  charts  some kind of calendar  thats my personal private business  annie 4 on 28 off next november 10th  britta 5 on 27 off  oh my god are you charting our menstrual cycles  what  gross  abed this is so personal  and so accurate  abed this is really creepy  i dont understand why you would do this  i can explain  oh i thought youd keep yelling over me  okay i can explain  you know i have trouble reading people  and say the wrong things sometimes  and i noticed it was happening more often with you three  than it was with the others  and then i noticed fluctuating patterns  and i started graphing them  and by the time i realized what i was actually measuring  it had started to yield really positive results for everybody  so i kept doing it  were you ever gonna tell us about this  i i feel so violated  more chocolate  oh get away from me  abed just became my hero   can i have a little  no  sheesh  guess its true what they say about the syncup  okay if i could just take this time  to share a few words of sarcasm  with whoever it is that took this pen  i want to say thank you for doing this to me  for a while i thought id have to suffer  through a puppy parade  but i much prefer being entombed alive  in a mausoleum of feelings  i can neither understand nor reciprocate  so whoever you are can i get you anything  ice cream best friend medal  anything mmmmm  okay sarcasm over  youre last up shirley  dump your comedically huge bag and end this  uh no thank you  well well well harvey keitel  well what do you know henry david thoreau  my oh my mike tyson  just empty the bag  no i dont have annies pen  im simply a christian woman that doesnt open her bag  what did the christian woman think would happen  when we got to her bag  the christian woman thought youd find it on the muslim  real nice  nicer than you condom carrier   dump the bag or youre guilty  no  oh lord hes thrown a clot  pierce call 911  no no no  pierce you didnt need to do that  yes i did  all you guys do is talk  leaving me to do the things you wont do  people like you are the reason  we took so long to get into vietnam  is this what you were trying to hide shirley  a pregnancy test  and more importantly  are they seriously marketing pregnancy tests to black women  guys this is a terribly childish way  to handle this kind of situation  does this mean you have a new boyfriend  who who who  not that its uh anyones business  i recently reconnected with my husband over labor day  and it seems the lord may have a plan for us  that doesnt include that stripper slut he ran away with  youre not pregnant shirley its impossible  why does everybody think im old  im around jeffs age i have a uterus  no no according to my charts  you couldnt have conceived labor day weekend  you would have been ovulating on halloween  which is just as well because if youre gonna have  a pregnant woman in one of these  i say go elevator labor or go home  halloween  well thats that then  yeah what a relief  looks like someone narrowly avoided  a lifestyle mistake of their own  oh or is it only bad if you sleep with unmarried men  the bible doesnt recognize divorce britta  when you marry a man hes your man  yeah and after he marries someone else  if you jump into the sack with him youre an angel  so long as you dont use protection  im so glad youre enjoying this  and i hope whoever stole that pen enjoys it in hell   nice try stephen fry  stephen fry  we all have an agreement  nobody leaves till we find it   oh  get off here we go  we are gonna find this pen  we are gonna find that pen   oh  and if we cant find it  our children will find it  is it over here in these books  this pen this incredible magical pen  that nobody knows how it could disappear  oh maybe its right in here  guys this is school property  can we just forget it  its a pen  its a pen now  really  its not a principle anymore  now its a pen  why the change of heart  youre not seriously accusing me  we searched my bag  which is exactly the last place youd put it  if you found it halfway through all this  in fact assuming that one of us does have the pen  who among us has the most incentive  to make sure it never sees the light of day   you want to go there  yeah   ill go there  okay   i was born there  really  theres a placard the commemorating me  whats going on and how can i help  anie relax  no you relax jeff  or are you scared that if you do my pen will fall out  you precocious little bitch  okay guys guys hey  guys stop  youre being complely illogical  we need to flip up the table divide the group by gender  and then search each other in our underwear  what  now what  everybody shake enough to dislodge  okay anything hit the floor  no  what are those underwear made out of  they look luxurious  oh theyre an organic soycotton blend  this gwynnifer must be real special  dont you usually wear  the stripey turquoise beetlejuice numbers  what does she mean usually  all right end of the road  weve torn apart the room  weve stripped  there is absolutely no place left  no  no  no  noooooo no  damn it broke my scissors  here be careful  this is the last pair we have  also dont cut his legs  im worried weve gone too far  this is how super villains are created  cant you just make an inspiring winger speech about trust  throw in a few digs at an easy celebrity target  and put a ribbon on this thing  abed think about this for one second  if a single one of us leaves this room  before we find that pen  how can any of us trust anyone in this group ever again  whats your hurry  im clothing myself  im not comfortable standing around in my alltogether  like you two anorex jeze  oh im so sorry  that was really mean  i dont know where that came from  weve all been through a lot today  and im sure this pregnancy scare  been weighing on you all week right  and maybe thats why you took my pen  what  where are you hiding it judgy beans  all right here we go  it smells like a waffle house sink  pierce are you using slim jims to scratch your legs  have we not gotten to a place free of judgment yet  this isnt it this isnt it  where is it wheres the pen  wheres the pen  wheres the pen  great  its getting a little chilly outside  so the animal wranglers have asked that every student  pick up a puppy and hold it  so they stay warm while the volunteers  hand out tiny puppysized hats  honestly i dont know why im even making these announcements  there cant be anyone who isnt already on the quad  annie id just like to say  on behalf of whoever actually stole this pen  i real am sorry about all this  i knew it was you  i knew it was you  all i know is it could be any of you  and for all we know its you  i wish it were i really do  i wish i could just find it behind my ear  id rather be that stupid than think that anyone of us  might be this inconsiderate  after all weve been through it almost seems impossible  it seems less than impossible  something impossible  actual seems more likely  here we go  winger speech to take us home  what if a ghost took the pen   let him finish  i am finished  for real honestly seriously why not  why not just a ghost took the pen  okay ive been saying that for hours  and we shouldve listening to troy from the beginning  guys look in your hearts  and answer this question honestly  whats more likely  that someone in this group doesnt belong in this group  or ghosts  if we have to choose between turning on each other  or pinning it on some specter  with unfinished penrelated business  im sorry but my moneys on ghost  well im not a religious person  but ive seen specials on the paranormal  anythings possible  relative to the alternative  it actually seems more logical to me  why would a ghost want a pen  troy  okay  so i see it as a lot like the movie paranormal activity  except for more boring and fancy  and i think in 1856  it is possible that a man was beheaded  while he was writing in his diary  to his long lost love  and now he roams the halls of greendale  screaming for his pen so he can write her a love letter  i need her i need her  he screams  as he looked for a pen  what the hell did you people do in there  something you and your puppies could only dream of  you nonmiraculous son of a bitch  nonmiraculous  wait abed
