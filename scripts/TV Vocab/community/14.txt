                before we start  id like to have a preliminary powwow  or prelimiwow about what im calling  our librarys backdoor conundrum  sounds like a porno with kate winslet  abed ew  the door on that side is locked after 500  which means that most of us have to walk all the way around  now if we were to move our meetings to 430   no  no  i have a regular class at that time  its like math or other regular classes  i have something unimportant that cant ever move  well maybe one of us could stand by the back door  and let the rest in   i nominate pierce  where is he  i have not seen him around all day  i havent either   well has anyone called him  i did  several times actually but he never returned my calls  oh no  oh the last thing i said to him was suck it   me too  good morning   oh  yes  thank god  you thought i was dead didnt you  no  i did  you people have any idea how emasculating that is  im not mickey rooney  you dont have to cross your fingers to see if ill show up  you know when i was 30  people used to wish that i was dead to my face  thats called respect  who is the lucky brunette  last name beeswax first name noneaya  oh my third wife was biracial   stop it  i am just trying to help  keep you out of trouble what if the next girl saw these  well then she would know it was hers  jeff  youre sleeping with a woman you already slept with  cant i be the friend in the group  whose trademark is his welldefined boundaries  like privacy smurf discreet bear or  confidentiality spice  but if you like her  why would you want to keep her a secret  dont you want us to meet her  we have an agreement to keep it lowkey  thats ridiculous obviously its a guy  youre wrong pierce its two guys  sometimes i do wish you were dead   thank you     whats up bro    boo  hey whats up jdog  woof woof woof woof  yeah   how you doing   were too gangsta for tv    thats why you dont see us    but they still wanna be us     sorry im late  professor slater quick question  you know the answer mr winger  i dont date students  even if you are no longer in my statistics class  im actually kind of seeing someone right now   thank you very much  really hows that going  fine for now shes smart and pretty  but sometimes i feel like shes just waiting for me  to stop talking and take off my pants    she is  ive never been someones dirty little secret  ive never had a dirty little secret  its so unprofessional  but the sneaking does make the sex 38 hotter  wow you do like statistics dont you    hey midterms and whatever  chalk  professor slater theres that transcript you wanted  jeff i didnt expect to see you here  hopefully im not interrupting    you know we laugh but the fact is  studentteacher relationships do happen  and they are a magnet for lawsuits  so we do stay vigilant  in fact physically attractive students and faculty  are actually placed on a watch list  and are ranked by their potential  to incite fraternization  you rank people by how hot they are  you got it number two   dean pelton  yes professor seven   uh slater  ill return this tomorrow  okay then  you guys be extra careful now  two people of your rankings in this small a room  with this type of lighting and his upper body  and what her heels and hemline are doing  to enhance what were already quite a few favors from god  its all the more important to keep it tasteful       i think he might have ruined  its dead      oh i cant wait for the recital  you are all wonderful especially you troy  thank you madame leclair  and if any of you mention my dancing outside of class  i will break off your legs  and use them to smash in your friends cars   oh  huh    oh my god  troy since when have you taken modern dance  since last semester  coach told me it would help with my coordination  and i fell in love with it in a very straight way  i know its tempting to sneak a peek  but im gonna need for you to keep your eyes up here  god i should have never dismissed you as a shallow jock  then again we havent really spent that much time together  thats because you dont play football  or have fun  i have fun tapdancing  i started last semester too  it was always something that i wanted to do  but it was too embarrassing so i never told anyone  same here britta   nobody can know about this  troy who are we kidding  look at how much time and energy were putting  into hiding something that were passionate about  we are leading a double life  i am spending a lot of money on breakaway clothing  we should look at this as an opportunity to come clean  are you saying we tell the group together  we could invite them to the dance recital on friday   man i dont know  let me think about it  okay lets do this   ahem  sorry  mr winger would you come to my office  we never finished our intercourse  i have study group right now  and nobody uses intercourse to mean anything other than sex   this is a wall of windows  my study groups behind it  i know  as soon as we touch the blinds will open  and six annoying but loveable misfits  will be staring at us   come on what are the odds  fine   now was that so bad  mmmm   hey  could you open the back door  you all remember michelle slater  my professor from last semester  as most of you may realize by now  shes the woman ive been seeing lately  why are they looking at me like im a zoo animal  well jeff acts as sort of the dad of the group  so emotionally this is kind of like being told  that youre our new mom  but you know its nothing like that right  absolutely do you cook macaroni   i have  macaronis my favorite  the important thing is we all understand  professor slater and i need this to be our little secret  everyone understand that   yeah  yes i do like macaroni   sure    see all good  well thank you everyone i appreciate it  i should get going   ooh  ooh   bye  bye  well jeff  youve taken a big step in knocking down the barriers  between students and teachers   just like rosa parks  i dont think its like that  no its just like that  i feel if you need to explain it  its not just like that  is your heart gonna be okay with this  i will try to find the tools to survive  okay  hey everybody speaking of secrets  troy and i have something that we would like to announce    oh  no no  theres a dance recital on friday  and i would be honored if you guys would attend  because since last semester i  have been taking a tap class    thats f funny  well i dont know how funny it is  come on were not making fun of you  but obviously you kept it a secret   because you saw the irony too  irony  well youre not a typically vulnerable or feminine person  and the act of dancing is considered   both vulnerable and feminine  i disagree  what about fred astaire what about baryshnikov  yeah i guess  there are exceptions to the rule  but even when jerry rice went on dancing with the stars  jerry rice  oh god i liked him  troy  what whats your secret  um  m my secret  is that  i knew brittas secret   yeah  i saw her in her dance outfit  and she looked ridiculous  so i helped her protect her shame  you know im just glad shes out now   bravo britta  thanks  mr winger there you are  just got word of your relationship  with professor slater  id like to see both of you in my office in half an hour  what the none of you left the room  how is that even possible  well for one thing its all over twitter  britta in a tutu can you imagine  hey what the hell  i thought we were supposed to come out to the group together  yeah i changed my mind  well theyre gonna find out that you dance at the recital  im not gonna be in the recital   im dropping the class  oh my god  how can you do this im so disappointed in you  hey you dont get to talk to me like that  you are not shirley  and shirleys not my mom  britta its not like we were in the same boat  girls are supposed to dance  thats why god gave them parts that jiggle  but id be going from starting quarterback  to a guy that twirls around in tights  ive got way more to lose getting up on that stage  because im a man  well guess what  a real man doesnt bail on his friends  or on himself  youre a dancer troy  its who you are  not anymore  excuse me  upset about jeff  no i am upset about  something i cant talk about  we can talk about anything  politics medicine jeff  okay uh did you hear that the shroud of turin  heres the thing about jeff  wow  chasing after you made him a better person  because you always called him on his stuff  all this time youve been warming him up  and stirring in sweetener and making him just right  and sure you werent ready to take a sip yet  but that didnt mean you want somebody  to snatch him off the counter  and guzzle him down right in front of you  shirley i did not warm jeff up  nobody ever will  do you think professor slater is getting flowers right now  do you think that they are gonna go to the movies  and hold hands visit her parents  no the only thing keeping them going  was the thrill of the secrecy  and now that it is out it is over believe me  can can i just ask  as a divorced black housewife  what part of being a single white slacker  makes you people so jaded  ooh you people  what do you mean you people  i cannot believe i got to say that  its the little things isnt it  okay well now that your secret is out there  im just gonna talk you  through this teacherstudent relationship form  and then we can get you two on your very attractive way  we havent even admitted to being a couple  in fact this is all based on hearsay  worse than hearsay pierces twitter account  in which he says hes 47  and teaches a women sonly pilates class  jeff its okay its out  and you know what it doesnt bother me  im happy  sweet  well  first question  how long have you been doing it  oh  not it  i mean this dating   a few weeks  mmhmm  and how long have you been doing it  we dont have to answer that  oh it hmm  now this is just hypothetical  might you ever consider  spending the night with a third person   thats not on there  well  wow its on there  just exploring your options obviously   no agenda  ill put tbd  would you describe yourself as boyfriend and girlfriend   yes  eh   what  oh boy  its semantics really isnt it   weve slept together  every night for the last three weeks  how would you describe me  the best friend ever  ooh  well uh  i guess ive had the wrong idea about us  but you know what this is good  id be better off dating um an adult  see you around   michelle  mm rarr  ill get the breakup form  i got freaked out by that boyfriend label  im  afraid of commitment  how original  look the biggest truths arent original  truth is ketchup its jim belushi  its job isnt to blow our minds  its to be within reach  so the truth is  i get claustrophobic when things get official  youre acting like im a venus flytrap  i didnt want or need more than what we were doing  lets get back to it should i get the door  i cant now because you went to the friend place  thats you getting official not me  because unless theres something i need to know  about the lunch lady or that blonde in your spanish class  with the infinite supply of leather jackets  somewhere between our 9th and 11th slumber party  statistically speaking  most people would call us more than pals  yeah but soon as you say it  it can get complicated and messy   how  because when you say it  later on you might have to unsay it  whoopee flippin ding winger  it happens 50 million times a day  its the jim belushi of sexual commitments  it barely means anything  and it grows on whats there over time  boy that guys really taking a pounding  in this conversation  ill see you around jeff    i really liked what we were doing  and if the ratio of work to pleasure  can really stay at that same level  i dont care what its called  ill do it lets do it  okay  okay  oh thats a big crowd out there  abeds really good at inviting people  were all here to support you  jeff even brought his girlfriend  oh shes his girlfriend now  cant wait till he hears about it  oh he knows  they even had to file paperwork with the dean  its pretty serious our little
