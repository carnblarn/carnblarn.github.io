                1 dean dean  dont shoot redhaired guy  why not  somethings not right about the game  we just took out a guy who turned out to be  a professional paintball assassin  a professional aah  that doesnt make sense  why would someone who gets paid to do things  be at greendale  aah  im not playing im not playing  no im the dean stop shooting me  aah  hi pistol patty  did they take you hostage  dean spreck  hello craig  city college  now i understand everything  now your whole evil plan is clear as day  but if you need to explain it to your men i understand  its simple craig  i posed as a fake ice cream company  sponsored your endoftheyear picnic  and waved enough money under your students noses  to provoke them to destroy their own campus  who hurt you steven  how could any dean be so mean  oh you havent seen  how mean this dean can been  theres one  after him  aah aah  wait did you say bean   guys guys  city college is trying to destroy greendale  and theyre an unstoppable juggle knob   juggernaut  juggernaut  which means if were gonna fight them  we have to form a schoolwide alliance of rebels  in other words it seems weve left the western motif  and are entering a more of a star wars scenario  i know  i wish it happened sooner too  but if we surrender our individuality  to form a faceless regime  how are we any better than them  youre the worst  okay she is just saying that to fit in  the floor recognizes magnitude  first off pop pop  and second magnitudes a oneman party  a oneman party cant be in an alliance  thats a paradox   i agree to disagree  easy paradox  were all on the same side  but hasnt the other side already won  their goal was to make us trash the school  we trashed it  yeah but we still might have a chance  to hit em where it hurts   their balls  no   just below their balls  their wallet leonard   i think its called a taint  oh  why do you think they sent in a ringer to win  it must be because were entitled  to the prize they promised   ooh i could use that money  this is why we have to agree right now  that whoever wins we give the money to greendale  to repair the damage and save our school  abed tell him  whatever pal i aint in it for your revolution  im in it for me  wait abed this was your idea  i know but im calling dibs on the han solo role  before jeff slouches into it by default  starburns i need that vest  oh yeah right  give me the vest laser breath  before our conversation gets nasty  question how long is the game gonna last  cause andres home with the baby  damn it shirley forget your newborn child  and think about the people that need you  i cant afford to lose a single soldier   what  oh now youre the leader  i dont see you stepping up  i dont step up to being leader troy  i reluctantly accept it when its thrust upon me  oh jeff  oh my god what is that  magnitude  pop  p  pop what pop what  what is he trying to say pop what magnitude  can you hear me who is this  oh thats jeff winger  you are in trouble now  jeffrey its your friend the dean  im safe  i can hear you mr winger  this is city colleges dean spreck  hey spreck you cheat  you cant spray people with paint by remote  and you cant have city college students  in a greendale game  all my men have been registered  at greendale for weeks  as for rules theyre clearly defined  in your schools agreement  with my fake ice cream company  if you get paint on you youre out  well im glad to see theres paperwork involved  because we are going to win and you are gonna pay  yay go jeff winger study group  those guys are ballers yo  i hope you like getting balled  sir this guy tried to charge us  three paint balls to use the bathroom  we were gonna shoot him  but tell him what you told us  dont shoot me  great now shoot him  sure shoot me  youd certainly be doing jeff winger a big favor  greendale human beings  it is now clear that we have no choice  but to team up and defeat city college  i also have no choice  but to accept the role thrust upon me  and what role would that be  no time to squabble troy  for greendale on three  one two  jeff every second counts  for greendale on two one  guys  for greendale  for greendale  greendale students  i understand youve unified  and intend to draw this game out  well if its a war you want  its a war you will lose  city college is stronger faster  our sperm counts are higher even in our women  resistance is as pointless as your degrees  honestly ask yourself  what does liberal arts even mean  look welcome to greendale  youre already accepted  losers   welcome to greendale  youre already dead  jackpot  shirley you keep watch while we get these  here help me with this  sure thing your worship  abed  stop trying to be han solo  its making me embarrassed for you  come on admit it you like it  i like having conversations with adults  playing star wars is worn out and immature  you like me because im immature  theres not enough immaturity in your life  i hope i dont get shot waiting out here  id hate to go home to my babies  so reconnaissance indicates  the key to city colleges strategy is  the gatling gun inside the ice cream truck  which we will charge en masse  overwhelming their defenses  and taking that gun for ourselves  well thats not how i would proceed  troy do you happen to have a better plan  i do happen jeff i happen very much  well use sneak attacks  to draw their patrol to the library  where one of us will pull the fire alarm  activating the sprinklers  which i will have rigged using my super plumbing skills  to shower everything in the building with paint  paint in sprinklers   are we the little rascals  i was  have you heard your plan  you want to charge a machine gun  ive got something to say  i dont take orders from girls  because they dont talk to me  watch it quasar face  annies a good kid and a better shot  so listen up or youll be floating home  thank you abed sorry  han  okay i think we should split the troops in half  and carry out both plans simultaneously  troy your plan will lure people off the ice cream truck  allowing jeffs troops to take the stronghold  youre welcome  im so glad that we didnt shoot you  now we have the tactical advantage  of knowing that jeff winger wants to be a ballerina  and that his achilles heel iswieners  thats just the tip of the iceberg  for one more pudding  ill tell you why hes jealous of me  and you say that they kicked you out of their study group   after two years  yeah  what took them so long  hey thanks for sticking up for me back there  this group gets so tangled in each others feelings  youre kind of a hero for standing outside of it  yeah well heroes are great  but ill take a blaster every time  anyway just wanted to let you know  i dont think youre immature  i think youre great  for a nogood  laserfaced jabba scoundrel  youre good kid  dont get cocky  hey  theyre right on our tail  operation troys awesome plan  is living up to its name

well then i guess ill see you in hell  then lets kick some taint  okay on my count  one two  vicki  all right shirley you have the most important job okay  yeah yeah pull the fire alarm  can we move this along im missing csi  enemy soldiers are incoming  i need everyone to evacuate through the air vent  garrett  i may be stuck in this vent  it is too early to tell  i think our only choice is to

nobody gives up  somebody will make it through understand  yes  charge  well im out we lost  see you at dennys  dennys is for winners  leonard were losing  britta ive been in a few real wars  but this

 guys i know exactly what we should do  we should see what troy thinks we should do  had some good ideas today  thanks man  okay ive given this a lot of thought  and ive decided we should sleep on it

late to drink a bottle of wine  in my bathing suit  pierce wait  you know ive been coming to this school for 12 years  ive never been friends with anyone here  more than a semester  probably for the same reason ive been married seven times  i guess i assume eventually ill be rejected  so i you know test people push them  until they prove me right  its a sickness i admit it  but this place has always accepted me  sickness and all  this place accepted all of you  sickness and all  its worth thinking about  um i think we have thought about it pierce  and youre right  and we were just picking
