                1 hey buzzby how are you today  not so great bumbleton  i have a ton of pollen to collect  but im really tired  flying a little low maybe you should get high   whos this  this is drugs   arent drugs bad  no way  drugs are like special honey they give you a buzzzzz  dont call me honey honey  pierce  drugs doesnt say that  i dont say anything by the way  i mean i thought this show was about drug awareness  whos gonna be aware of a character that has no lines  and also i noticed on page 15 i get flushed down the toilet  consider yourself lucky  annie question is pierce marijuana  and does marijuana help people work faster  i thought it made them just custompaint their vans  and solve mysteries  also are you sure that my costume is on backwards  somehow i felt more confident before  i have a question i dont think my character  would say tripping balls  thats not a question  i dont think my character  would say tripping balls okay  guys lets remember why were doing this  if our work helps even one kid make better choices  then it will all be worth it  i wish i had seen a show like this when i was younger  it might have helped me avoid my mistakes  well were happy to do this for you annie  but i have to say my school had plenty of shows like this  and i think sitting through them drove me to drugs  you dont count britta  you dont respond to anything appropriately  thank you  deandong  im just checking in to see  how the greendale antidrug players are doing  now i talked to the guidance counselor  at the san ramone middle school  and theres gonna be at least 50  little atrisk rug rats coming here tomorrow  for your big world premiere  that is terrific  so with any luck we can get rid of  all those charleston chews in the vending machines  um dean pelton were you hoping to participate   in the show   oh i would love to annie  but as you can see from my outfit  i already have plans so off to the airport ramada  how come he gets a front stinger  give me some rope time in a tree  give me the hope to run out of steam  somebody said we could be here  we could be roped up tied up dead in a year  i cant count the reasons i should stay  one by one they all just fade away  do you think bees eat their own honey  im sure theyve at least tasted it   this guy keeps texting me  you dont like him  i dont like flirting in text  thats like saying you dont work by electric light  if you want to have an active sex life  part of it is texting  hmm i dont remember asking your opinion  cant talk now  shirley since i might be the father of your unborn child  i made you a mix tape  i hope you like johnny gill  and since you probably dont have a cassette player  heres a list of used ones on craigslist  britta are you walking out of this room  uh yeah  hey you know that youre gonna  have to acknowledge him eventually  i dont know who youre talking about   chang  i know who youre talking about he doesnt exist   um annie  ooh   im sorry a word  mmhmm  i dont know if you know this  but i did tv commercials for hawthorne wipes  family business in the fifties  oh  i was kind of the gerber baby of moist towelettes   thats great pierce  yeah yeah  oh ive done a lot of acting   workshops   mm  i do physical comedy funny dances   foreign accents   accents  name any country  russia  point being  there are many tools i can bring to the table  that i think the script may be wasting  pierce you know what i think  is really great about this show  the only real star of it is the message  right uh is the message jeff winger  because hes on every page of this thing   ill see you tomorrow  uh  you bet  oh britta left her phone   shes getting a text message  let me see   oh its from marcus  mm  ill be at the show tomorrow night  cant wait to see you  are you really wearing a cat costume   mm  well marcus  you are in luck  what are you doing  dragging britta kicking and screaming into 1997   what did you say  theres not much  to the cat costume  but cant wait to show you whats underneath  how could you think that was a good idea   i got a better question  mmhmm  how could it not be a great idea  what  pierce what are you doing here  never mind that  theres a rapist in the hallway  thats my landlord  and if he wanted to rape you youd be raped  did you follow me  let me answer your question with two of my own  what are you doing in an apartment above dildopolis  and when did they open a second location  this is where i live pierce  it just happens to be above a marital aid store  i dont get it arent everyones parents rich  well im not speaking to my parents  after my nervous breakdown  my mom wanted to put the problem behind us  and i wanted to deal with it so i went to rehab  and she cut me off  what are you living on  i saved every penny from babysitting  every birthday check  every dollar from the period fairy when i was a kid  i guess i thought it would last longer  excuse me whats a period fairy  the fairy that gives you a dollar  every time you get your period  does she still come   pierce  you know  you and i are very much alike annie  were both realists were both cute  and wed both rather die than let someone else control us  i see the point of this place now  this crap hole is a monument  to selfreliance  i found the drapes in a dumpster  can you believe it  yes  you know i wanna help annie  oh no no no no no no pierce   come on now  im not taking money from you  its not mine its yours  youve earned it for being strong  its going to drop into your hands from out of nowhere  because i was never here  okay im only taking this  because im a little worried about making rent  and they told me the procedure for selling eggs  takes three weeks  you save your eggs for a rainy day  ill see you tomorrow  pierce  hey why did you follow me here today  oh it was nothing it  seems sort of pointless now  i guess just to talk about the play  andwho cares if i dont have any lines  well you know what pierce  you should do that line you improvised   dont call me honey honey  yeah thats it  you should do that  you were the gerber baby of moist towelettes right  yes yes i was  action  hello im cornelius hawthorne  one rainy day my son pierce and i  were taking a stroll when i discovered  the cleansing power of moist cotton fresh from the field  isnt that right son  it sure is  it sure is dad  pierce knock it off  i wanna be in the commercial too father  well then you should have done better  in your damn audition  whats your name son  nigel  youre a good boy nigel  your father is a lucky man  okay guys remember  the most important thing is to have fun  and the second most important thing  is to know all your lines and all your blocking  and not mess up a single thing actually flip those  here we go guys i took the liberty  of juicing up some of our bits  umbut  pierce you cant just revise annies script  and who uses witeout anymore  why dont we look over pierces changes  and see if they improve things  hey crayon do you know where i can get some drugs  i need them  unfortunately you can get them anywhere   anywhere  im here  zabbadazooey  good one  well doesnt seem to hurt anything  so lets get into costume and break a stinger  for the bees  annie uh  ii dont feel comfortable with the zabbadazooey line  the one you wrote  i got it  lets give jeff the zabbadazooey line  and then ill come in with a good one   yeah  its more my voice  pretty sure jeff is gonna reject that idea  yeah youre probably right  youre the producer  by the way is this your pen  ithink i put it back in my pocket  after i wrote you that check yesterday  ill give it to you later  ill talk to jeff  also i think itd be better for my character  if i wear his leather jacket  okay  welcome to greendales drug awareness show  okay our volunteers  are handing out drugfree baseballs huh  next time you think about drugs  think about baseball instead  cant ignore me forever  okay you probably can  i dont know why you want to  i dont know if i told you my nephew marcus  actually goes to san ramone middle school  and hes coming to see the show   marcus your nephew  yeah hes 14  i actually thought he didnt even like me  but then he texted me out of nowhere and he said  cant wait to see you  ive been looking forward to this for so long  you are the coolest aunt in the world  i hope that i dont let him down   youll be great  what does this symbol mean  its a number eight an equal sign  and then a greater than symbol  let me see  youd better get changed  ill hang onto your stuff for you  great  abed we screwed up

bees youre up cool cats your on deck   arent drugs bad  no way  drugs are like special honey  they give you a buzzzzzzz  dont call me honey honey  are you ignoring me because im korean   youre chinese  oh theres a difference  shh  its because youre crazy all right  theres something wrong with you  and the idea that i was with you  means theres something wrong with me  and if this baby  if you have any humanity at all  you will not make me think about it  shirley funeral  well that answers my question  jeff winger is sexy even in a coffin mmm  im here  pierce youre supposed to be onstage  i was

 what do you want us to do  should we get the dean  should we call in a bomb threat  should we set off the sprinklers  its not that big a deal  i think the kids are into it  yeah but i dont think that theyre getting the message  yeah but do kids ever really seem  like theyre getting the message  i think its sinking in  well i guess its your call  and anyway hes about to get flushed down the toilet  in the next scene and hell be done  i wish i had never even met drugs  who invited the nerd from the beehive  drugs made you  how about you leave drugs  zip pop zoom  whoosh  they want more  i gotta go back out there  but pierce you were flushed that was the story  thats whats supposed to happen to drugs  being flushed doesnt necessarily mean youre dead  i mean i could be a floater  you know a floater is when you have a number two  i know what a floater is pierce  it just it wouldnt make any sense  in the flow of the show and it sends a mixed message  you know what i think is a mixed message  yesterday you couldnt pay your rent and today you can  come on annie you and i are alike  were independent we need each other  yi yi yi yi yi  bzzz getting rid of drugs is a great ibeea  im

chemical dependency program  i have ever watched  i mean the way you got the kids  to think that they needed drugs  and then having them realize  that dependence was the enemy  that the price was just too high  oh genius  so now that the show is over  what is the plan for these bee costumes  aah aah uncle  hi marcus im jeff  im like uh brittas boyfriend  look dude she started it okay   shes just as into me  no listen listen  im not mad  i was just fooling around  and i sent those texts   gross  yeah  well it was pretty disgusting  sending those pictures to your aunt  more disgusting than what
