oh my god  hes got her in some kind of hippie collar  i can hear her armpit hair growing from here  we got to do something   okay even if i agreed with you what are we gonna do   thats nice   well i know if we say we disapprove  well just drive her further into his hempbraceleted arms  we need to be smart we need to hatch a scheme   mm hatching schemes is not really my wheelhouse   lets not confine ourselves to your wheelhouse  this problem wont respond to tap dancing  or casual revelations that you spent time in new york   okay if youre gonna get all upper east side  about this i think were done   hey winger check out annie  somebody just went to the top of my to do list      okay we need to hatch a scheme   thank you   its all very simple  in annies world long before vaughn  she only had eyes for troy   so if troy becomes a real option  annie will drop vaughn in a hippies heartbeat   crash course in manipulation  you dont actually tell the person what you want them to do  you help them realize they want to do it  so it cant be traced back to you   chemistry sexy  you know what else is sexy  annie    i know chemistry is sexy  but annie i dont see it   well every other guy on campus does   you really dont see how pretty annie is   maybe its cause i knew her back in high school  before she dropped out  she had braces and acne and a pill addiction  and a nervous breakdown ending with her running  through a plateglass door screaming everyones a robot   i see whats happening here  troy i want you to clear your head   done  im gonna describe to you  a complete stranger who happens to be  in our study group  would you excuse us for a moment   annie  no kidding  come on you got to be exaggerating  oh man     and shes jewish  i cant believe i didnt see that  well i guess she deserves another shot  oh wait never mind its too late  i heard shes hooking up with vaughn   only to make you jealous both what   shes helplessly in love with you  shes only with vaughn to get your attention  and you have to give it to her now right jeff   sure  but the point is  were not telling you what to do   oh yeah you didnt hear it from us   i have the weirdest boner   i saw you die  how can you be alive   i guess its just a bad day for drugdealing terrorists  and a good day for kickpuncher   all right guys you hear that pause  right after he says and a good day  what do you got for me there   and a good day for a nutritious breakfast   i dont get it   its a good day for a terrible movie   a good day for hair products   oh buzz how many times can you keep going to that well  come on guys  im starting to wonder if you even deserve  to call yourselves a community college sketch comedy troupe  i told you on movie night  i need to blow these punks out of the water  i need phyllis dillergrade stuff   wouldnt you rather just watch a movie  with your friends and have a good time   what are you my third wifes therapist   what if he said its a good day for  and you said for being gay     youre a genius   he likes gay jokes   what  i said we write great jokes   dont flatter yourselves   whoa  hey  annie  its me troy   oh i dont know where abed is  i could try calling him if you want   nah im not looking for my other half  im looking for you girl   oh   yeah  let that sink in for a second  you know i never noticed how  beautiful you are   troy youre being weird   sorry it took me so long  they made me find a shirt   vaughn you remember troy  um we went to high school together  and hes in my study group   hey whats up man hi bro    im not your bro  bro   oh actually everyone is my bro  in the whole entire universe  you know because everythings connected  rocks eagles hats   yeah well some things are more connected than others  like tarantulas and me peeing my pants  or me and annie  what wait  troy what  tell him  tell him that youve been in love with me since high school   what  wait a minute is that true mountain flower   no  i mean  i never want to lie to you  so i will tell you i did have feelings for him  but its over i swear   youre swearing  like britta swore that she didnt like jeff  and then gave him a copy of my poem  so he could laugh at me with that sherri shepherd lady  oh its happening again  your study group is evil  and you dont deserve ice cream        well hes a baby  now where were we   i like him why would you do that   come on  everybody knows you want a cut of the tbone steak  jeff and britta told me how you feel   wait jeff and britta did what now   oh youre even hotter when youre angry  lets do this  red shoe diaries  i think you know i have a thing for butt stuff   to annies inevitable breakup with grodie j mcconaughey   and to her and troy  we did the right thing they belong together  plus their babies will be so cute   why would you say that  come on  you know that babies are extra cute  when their parents are   both cute   do you want kids  well see  put on something nice and find me after lunch   hey guys thanks for getting involved in my love life  that was super cool and mature of you  oh and since youre both clearly idiots  i should probably let you know that im being sarcastic   hey guys thanks for taking ugly annie  out of the palm of my hand  and turning her into yet another hottie  that will never get with me   hey guys thanks for eating all the macaroni   shut up leonard  nobody even knows what youre talking about  i did eat all the macaroni  its messed up that he knows   lets light this candle  whos ready for some kickpunching   actually we decided to watch runaway instead  tom selleck fights mechanical spiders   what no no you cant do that  we just watched kickpuncher we have to see kickpuncher 2  i have so many unanswered questions   no i want to watch tom selleck  fight mechanical spiders   yes  me too   my brother died on the set of that movie  one of the mechanical spiders just went haywire  and tore him to pieces  tom selleck just stood there  he just stood there and and watched him die   okay then let lets watch kickpuncher 2 then   yeah okay  im sorry for your loss man   im sorry pierce  yeah thats messed up dude     kickpuncher 2   my punches were only as strong as my punches  and then things changed   change time to change the channel  this guys gonna be begging for change  he keeps making movies this bad  they should change this movie to something good  i wish this crapapillar  would change into a butterfly and fly away  thats change we can believe in   okay obviously something strange is happening here   what do you mean  im making jokes during the movie   yeah but youre doing it with the speed  and the determination of the incomparable robin williams   yeah  maybe im just that brilliant   i think you came prepared   dude even i know youre lame  and im a tenured professor sitting in a beanbag chair   youre not a professor   shut up man   fine you got me  i did a little advance work pathetic  no ill tell you whats pathetic  you all sitting there making fun of other peoples work  you dont feel good about yourselves  so you have to tear down everything around you  whats the matter mama chang didnt breastfeed   she read in a book that it wouldnt make a difference   you all sicken me  and i will no longer participate  in your destructive negative behavior   pierce that was deep  and total bs   yeah this isnt about us  this is just a deflection because you cant get  a genuine laugh  mmhmm   that in itself is a laugh  i know im funny  i dont need any of you people to validate me   mm  mm   oh oh      biggest laugh of the night    then i was gonna say its a good day to be gay     annie  were sorry  we were worried about your wellbeing   i guess we feel like were sort of all a family  and jeff and i are like your greendale parents   youre not my mom britta  she would never wear boots that go up that high  and what about respecting me as an adult and as a friend   oh you want to be treated as an adult and a friend  try not dating your friends exboyfriend  find your own man  oh my   oh boy   but you dont like vaughn   no i dont but i also dont like seeing him  with anyone else tada   i asked you if you cared and you said no   fine i cared im a girliegirl  i like boys and i dont like it when theyre mean to me  and i dont like it when they stop kissing me  and start kissing my friends  im not that cool im not juno okay homeslice   this is what it was about for you  you were jealous   oh please you cant tell me  that you werent jealous that vaughn had his hippie hands  all over your debatemakeout partner   what are you insinuating  i took that kiss for the team   what  yeah that kiss wasnt for pleasure  it was strategic and joyless  what  yeah   you did get weirdly specific  when you were describing annies body   more specific than the stuff you told me about britta  both what   does anyone get specific about me   check your email   ill mark you as spam   who the hell is pam   when you guys first came in  we were as wholesome and healthy  as the family in the brady bunch  and now were as dysfunctional and incestuous  as the cast of the brady bunch   i agree with abed this is getting creepy   no more creepy than when jeff wears tight jeans  and you say id like to slap  those buns on the grill both what   first of all i dont talk like that  and second of all where im from  its perfectly normal for women  to talk about their male friends backsides  and you dont see me saying anything crazy  about abed and troys weird little relationship  both theyre just jealous   all right all right maybe were not a family  maybe its more complicated because unlike a real family  theres nothing to stop any one of us  from looking at any of the others  as a sexual prospect      why are we even talking about this   because you started having sex with brittas exboyfriend   what we havent even kissed   that doesnt mean youre not having sex   vaughn told me he would take things  as slowly as i wanted  he likes me for who i am and i like him     do you guys hear that        annie  vaughn   britta   hi  old man river   eat me   did you get my messages   no  i threw my phone into the river  i thought that you know if i cant be with her  who am i gonna call  and then i thought you know  well my landlord my sister  and  you  anyway ive been doing a lot of soulsearching  and uh this is something i really need to say      i see you when you smile    and i want to sing a song    but then i write the words    and they always come out wrong    they come out wrong    i feel it in my fingers    i feel it in my toes    but then the words get frozen    in my mouth like eskimos    i like your nose    ooh ooh ooh    ooh    annie    ooh ooh ooh    ooh    annies song    his songs are dumber than he is   yeah but theyre honest   okay    vaughn wants to show me a cloud that looks like a pumpkin  if thats okay   annie its more than okay  please date vaughn   or anyone else outside this creepy circle   i wouldnt hang out with you guys  if you were creepy  trust me  i have good taste   so just to be clear i dont have a shot  with any of you    i am kickpuncher  my cyber punch have the power of kicks      agh  aha oh  oh      i am punchkicker  meet your match        i love you kickpuncher   the only thing beyond the reach of my fists  is humanity   youre sure britta couldnt do your part   i asked her she wasnt available   lets go film the sex scene
