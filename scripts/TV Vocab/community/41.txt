                guys what happened  apparently they found him unconscious on a park bench  my god is he okay  we dont know we just got here  hes ready for visitors now hes in 1023  welcome my old friends  welcome  pierce what happened   we were all so worried  it was the pills  they just took me over  i saw awful horrible things  demons aliens critters 3  something called bruce willis surrogates   abed what are you guys doing  its okay just act natural  pierce asked me to document his life for historical purposes  at first i said no at the risk of sounding overly sensitive  i feel intensely bored by pierce as a subject  but im excited about the narrative facility of the documentary format   its easier to tell a complex story when you canjust cut its easier to tell a complex story when you can cut the narrator  ive called everyone here so that i could put my house in order  bequeath parting gifts  say my final words to each of you  final words youre gonna kill us  no dummy the pills wiped me out  im dying  im not really dying  over the last few weeks  its become apparent how little respect this group has for me  so ive summoned them here to exact my revenge  see  fish in a barrel    im so sad i dont know what to do  usually if i need to cheer up i just make fun of pierce but now  itd make me sadder   its gregory hines all over again  look im sure hell be fine  you know how dramatic pierce gets  remember when he had the hiccups and pulled the fire alarm   lets just try to relax  hes here because we relaxed  no hes here because he relaxed a handful of pills at a time  thats all over now  were here for him so theres no point in feeling bad  we know theres no point jeff we kind of just felt like feeling it  yeah jeff what are you abed   sorry abed  no problem doesnt bother me  mr hawthorne is ready to commence his bequeathings  shouldnt you be telling that to an orderly   hes gonna give us gifts  cool  i mean  cool  i dont want pierce to die  but if im gonna get bequeathed upon  id like to be bequeathed a drum kit  or a signed photo of actor levar burton  those would be my top two wishes  my third wish would be a million wishes  but id just use em all on a million signed photos of actor levar burton  hello pierce  i got you some things from the gift shop to cheer you up  i got you a john grisham novel  and a funny little coffee mug  you see how the fleas door mat says dog sweet dog  shirley we both know that you and i are the most hated in the group  we do  and since in my absence youll be the new black sheep  im sorry thats offensive  black swan  i want you to have this  its a compact record and it contains  an audio file of your study group  talking about you while youre out of the room  its all here burnt into this diskette by optical lasers   i dont believe you  i know it sounds like science fiction  i dont believe theres anything  then i guess this is goodbye  forever  goodgoodbye pierce  smell you later  he said its a recording of you all talking behind my back  ridiculous  thats what i told him because you all dont do that  right  mr hawthorne is requesting sour face   is that you death  its britta  before you speak i want to tell you that you dont have to give me anything  i am happy to just spend time with you   like dylan thomas said about death  what did he say  okay bluff called  youre the selfless one in the group right  i havent thought about myself in years  thats what makes you the perfect recipient  of this bequeathment  its a check for 10000  with the payee line blank  so that you can give it to the charity of your choice  pierce this is  surprising  after what you gave shirley we thought you were playing mind games  thank you  if you are so inclined you could write your name in there  toodles  i dont want to die in a place like this  people shouldnt die in the same place people magazines do  i hope to die surrounded by my family  the only way i agreed to be surrounded by my family  me and abed have an agreement if one of us dies  we stage it look like a suicide caused by the unjust cancellation of firefly  were gonna get that show back on the air buddy  howd it go  fine  he gave me a check for 10000 to give to the charity of my choice  see hes not messing with us maybe he just hates shirley  what  maybe  i just need to research a few charities  because some take a lot off the top  and you think youre giving money to people that really need it  and youre really giving it to some middle man whos gonna  pay off their parking tickets credit cards  and keep from getting kicked out of her place in  april  hed like to see annie next  you know what no hell see jeff next   no youre not supposed to go  or what  youll do twice as much work as a doctor for half the pay  thank you  its called a complisult part compliment part insult  he invented them  i coined the term  see what i just did there that was an explanabrag  hello jeffrey  ive thought about this day many times  but ive always imagined it differently  for starters i thought youd be the one in bed and id be a hologram  what  never mind theres no time for that now  its starting to seem from observing the others  that youre using the social leverage afforded you by your alleged deathbed  to exact complicated acts  of psychological vengeance on those closest to you  vengeance oh no  i was never one to hold a grudge jeffrey  my father held grudges  ill always hate him for that   did you get along with your father  i got along without him  thats no good jeffrey  you dont want your dad to die before you tell him how you feel  im sure youre right look lets nip this in the bud  were sorry we didnt respond quickly enough to your pill addiction  is there any chance that apology is enough  are you ready to be bequeathed upon jeff  blow my mind  i found your father  did you now  william winger born oklahoma city 1945   divorced in 1983 most recently residing in dorchester  currently  sitting in a town car on its way to this very hospital  should be here in an hour or so  give or take a father  that it  all right see you at the funeral  and so it is bequeathed  what are you gonna say to your dad  im not gonna say anything because i wont have to  because pierce is playing head games with us   ive decided not to listen to it  what  im not gonna listen to the cd of you guys talking about me  because i forgive you  but how do we know what were being forgiven for   we dont even know whats on there  and you never have to  what if he is coming though what are you gonna say to him  ill be him  hi im jeffs dad  hi jeffs dad   im brittas dad  what why  i dont know got drunk didnt have a condom  and her mom gets freaky when she hears oingo boingo  i wish i could relate but like my son im a closet homosexual  dont apologize for that  youre talking to the guy that banged brittas mom  i have no standards  what if we take a tumble ill put a wig  thats it youre under arrest im an undercover cop   its not illegal to be gay  it is here in iran   not when were in the green zone  thats iraq stupid  what do i know im jeff wingers dumb gay dad  my father was a twobit con man of so little substance  he couldnt leave a trail if he wanted to  and i dont care if pierce hired scotland yard  he isnt gonna track him down from a hospital bed  i mean money cant just make people appear  excuse me  im looking for troy barnes  pierce hawthorne sent me  im levar burton  pierce got levar burton to come here for troy  is there anyone he cant produce  now im really getting mad  why am i the only one he decided to torture  i told pierce a thousand times  i never wanted to meet levar in person  i just wanted a picture  you cant disappoint a picture  i hate you pierce  i hate you so much  i forgive you  annie edison  your bequeathal is at hand  do you have a regular job here  i know youre being strong for me  i give you permission to weep  im crying on the inside  gross  in any case i want to give you this  its been in my family for six generations  now its yours   do you want to see your dad  hes not coming  but do you want to see him  then why arent you leaving  because i dont care  and im not gonna let him think that i care   your dad or pierce  there is no dad  and get this thing out of my face  and dont you dare intercut this with footage of me freaking out  is there footage of you freaking out  im gonna kill you and pierce and britta  and anyone else who thinks i care about any of this  so do you go to school nearby  are you more familiar with me from star trek or reading rainbow  reading rainbow was a show i hosted and produced for 25 years  ever seen it  set phasers to love me   what does it mean  what do you mean  no riddles youre screwing around with everyone  you gave me a tiara what does it mean  are these blood diamonds  are they holocaust diamonds  what does it mean  it means youre my favorite  what does that mean  i did it i gave away the money  the red cross  you know what that makes me a terrible person  because if that camera wasnt on me  i would have taken that money right out of the mouths of crippled  starving malariaridden refugee kids  and now i know that forever  youve got to forgive yourself  ive forgiven all of you for the horrible things  for crying out loud give me that cd   were gonna listen to it  i dont want to  britta wait  ill be right back dont learn anything without me  so how much do we all hate shirley  knock it off  james bond stop trying to record us with that stupid spy pen  we can see the blinking light  why do you recording us badmouthing each other  because he thinks friendship is a competition  hes always trying to get the upper hand  think shirleys any different  moron  guess we do owe you an apology  we shouldnt have said those things about you  i guess the lesson here is  that i sometimes use guilt as a weapon   what are you doing  just shooting a talking head  or did you want me to be the only one who didnt have one  no go ahead  i think it stems from when i was  you found my father  yes hes on his way  if this is too much to handle  i completely understand and i can call it off   i think im ready to see him  good  good for you  i should probably tell you  if youre lying to me if my father isnt coming  if a car pulls up and anyone other than my father steps out say  an actor or you in a wig  if you try to pull any ferris bueller parent trap threes company fx  fx2 the deadly art of illusion bullshit  ill beat you  and there will be nothing madcap or wacky about it   understood  crystal   im levar  i know  i was a huge fan of rebop  it was cancelled before i was born but i scored some vhs copies  i was nostalgic from a very early age  cool  i assumed that troy was a fan but he hasnt said a word to me  and now ive got to catch this flight  you cant go  he loves you he talks about you all the time  how much would it cost to change your flight till tomorrow  is 261 enough cause thats all ive got  thats all youve got  no you keep your money  ill reschedule  thank you hes gonna be so happy  you are a very generous friend  but youre stupid with your money  its not that im selfish  its just that im really stupid with my money  which is why ill never have a lot of it  and because im a really generous friend  problem solved  dilemma deleted  britta for the win  thank god he didnt take it  could you imagine bouncing a check to kunta kinte  this is your father  its me here in this sedan  see im waving  im sorry i cant come any closer my boy  this is too difficult  you look too much like your mother  dont come closer  as you were  have to catch a flight to katmandu  i wanted to say cherish your new friends  theyre your true family now  dont open it itll be too hard for both of us  when you improvise a plan  sometimes you hit a speed bump  and sometimes you hit it so hard  that you soar through the air  far beyond your initial expectations  i set out to take revenge on jeff winger  to scare him with the ghost of his father  instead  i took over the role of his father  and helped make him a better man  itll be a long time before jeff winger  underestimates me again  why would you do something like this  because  im sick of you people not taking me seriously  you forget my birthday  you dont invite me  to your dungeons  dragons games or your secret trampoline  you guys think im some kind of a joke  this isnt disproving the theory  good point  whatd you say  apparently i need to say some things to my father  things that i may have screamed at pierce instead  im not saying he doesnt deserve it  but my father deserves it too  i figured out your test crowns presents  punishments  favorites  youre trying to show me the dangers of my own elitism  my constant striving to be the best  im requeathing this tiara  because if i become the kind of person  who thinks its their place to pick favorites  and torture the rest ill die sad and alone  thats what you taught me  very good annie  you pass  shes actually just my favorite  so i thought the documentary format would be like fish in a barrel  but as is the case with a real one  it can become cramped chaotic and stinky  if in the end your documentary is turning out  just as messy as real life  you can wrap it up with a random shots  which when cut together under a generic voiceover  suggest a profound thematic connection  im not knocking it  it works  guys  jeff and i became  kind of like father and son today  no we did not  troy i am telling you this salmon is really good  would you mind passing me the pepper  more fish for kunta
