                it was my friend abeds birthday  i had met abed at community college  almost two years earlier  his obsession with pop culture  had always alienated him  hed quote movies pretend his life was a tv show  he watched cougar town  it was as if he didnt want people to like him  then this year around christmas  he had some kind of  i dont know mental episode  saying people were made of clay stuff like that  hed seemed okay since but when i asked him  if hed like to do anything for his birthday  he told me we should have dinner just he and i  for an important conversation  it made me nervous  the restaurant abed had chosen wasnt his style at all  there were cloth napkins no tvs  abed liked chicken fingers video games  quentin tarantino  babysitting him through a full meal  at a restaurant for grownups  i just wasnt up for it  but i loved abed everyone did  so i had come there with a surprise plan of my own  hey uh could i get a macallan neat  jeffrey  buddy  i like your sweater  did it come with a golden retriever  you look good too  i would like a uh spritzer  abed was being weird  and by that i mean he wasnt being weird  he was hugging smiling making eye contact  and in 30 seconds he hadnt made a reference to anything  i had come in worried about him  thinking he needed help  but seeing him like this made me more worried than ever  get it like pulp fiction  its a wallet that says bad mother   your tables ready gentlemen  thank you  actually uh i had an idea  i saw a very cool burger place just a few  nonsense i didnt come downtown for burgers  come come  uh iill be right there  hey uh were running a little bit late  no big deal just a small speed bump  well hurry up were waiting  surprise  guys no theyre running late  that was jeff he says theres some kind of speed bump  pierce nobody can hear you  well im hot and my balls are touching the zipper   can you imagine the expression on abeds face  when he walks in  of course we can imagine it its always the same  yeah but hes gonna say cool  at least five times  its really great of jeff to put this together  im not jealous   hmm   hmm  oh cool someone got him a briefcase  like in the movie whats in it  hey dont touch that  its from jeff and he says  nobody but abed can open it  why whats in it  what i have 3d vision now   yes you do   you dont know me  everybody just be patient and dont mess with anything  i am responsible for this diner when my boss isnt around  she will not stop bragging about that  i know  has anyone seen this movie were referencing  am i the hero or the love interest  pulp fiction yeah i saw it on an airplane  its cute its a 30minute film  about a group of friends who like cheeseburgers  dancing and the bible   jeffs not better than me   hmm  i said hmm  boy is this menu stuffy  i dont know about you but id rather have a nice  rillettes de saumon to start i think  and ooh squab   very good   they dont have quail  good to know salad   excellent choice   yeah i nailed it  um you forgot this in the bar  ah so i did im sorry  what a thoughtful gift jeff  i really was a man of singular taste  was abed whats going on  why are you dressed like mr rogers  and talking like frasier what happened to you  oh where to begin  i probably mentioned in the past my fondness  for a tv program called cougar town  here and there  i even started a cougar town fan club  on facebook  not to accomplish anything mind you  simply to express my love for the show  well it ended up being quite large this fan club  and uh one morning  i think it was maybe early march  i got this facebook message  a very nice message from the people who make cougar town   looking for work  no thanking me jeff  you know for all the support i generated for the show  and in the last paragraph they said  if youd like you could come visit the set  just like that   well thats cool of them   mmhmm  i guess that kind of makes them  the pulp fictions of people  man how great was that movie  yeah so i sold a few of my action figures  and i bought a roundtrip ticket to los angeles   wait you went when  over spring break  what could i do two days after i got that invitation  i was on the set of cougar town jeff  cougar town  look if you want me to take it seriously  stop saying its name  you laugh jeff  but the people were wonderful  you know not just the actors  but the crew everyone  there must have been 200 people  each with a specific function  but all dedicated to a single purpose  it was like a village or like a living thing  and you know im talking to the director  and he says why dont you jump into the background  i say nah wait a minute  jump into the background of what exactly  and he says jump into the background of this scene  walk through it walk through cougar town  thank you  well before i can react this girl takes me by the hand  and she stands me behind this patio  where courtney cox and the actors are doing their scene  and the girl says now when you hear action  i want you to walk from here to there right  thats when i really started to panic jeff  because if im a person that watches cougar town  how can i be in cougar town  you know and the more i start thinking about it  the less any of it makes any sense at all  and i just want to turn and run but its too late  because the directors calling action  so before i take my first step  i realize that i have to stop being someone  whos ever seen the show  and become a character on the show  become a man from cougar town  you know someone born there  someone whose name i decide is chad  and i take my first step as a child might  learning to walk as chad  and with each step it becomes easier  and with each step i start remembering things  from chads life like his first kiss  under the big tree at cougar town field  playing soccer  at cougar town junior high  finding my first chest hair in the shower  my first apartment  my first true love falling for my best friend  birthdays weddings car crashes taxes  playing charades at thanksgiving  chad had lived jeff  you know chad had lived more than abed  and then they called cut  and the scene was over  but i wasnt ready to stop being chad  so i said to the director can we have one more take  but they were already moving on  courtney had nailed it  my lips started trembling  and my my hands and my feet went numb  my my knees buckled  and as i fell to the floor  i pooped my pants  i did  because the truth is jeff i had been chad  and chad was dead  but as abed i was still alive so someone helped me up  and the wardrobe lady came over she gave me new pants  i thanked everyone i apologized  and then i just got on a bus and went straight to the airport  um your foods getting cold  oh how silly of me  wondering if abeds new best friend  also got him the best gift  i got abed the best gift  id tell you what it is but its an even cooler secret  britta you promised that this private party  would be done by 800  youre doing this during the peak business hours  for nostalgicthemed diners  oh is that true has that been researched  it has annie  after they get frightened by the evening news  many seek the comforting foods and soothing music  of a preracial america  ill give you all of my tips from my next shift  oh your tips  all your tips wait wait all of them  like all the tips the customers leave for you  wow is there any way we can go ahead and spread that out  over two years so i dont get slammed on my taxes  oh my goodness  i know   everyone hates britta   mm  of course you know the real point of that story  i dont but thats okay chew  the point is id been a fool  nah everybody poops their pants  no no no i was a fool long before that  you know i look back at my life and i think who was that  why did he care so much about so many things that didnt matter  yeah who needs cougar town  who needs any pop culture whatsoever  tv movies to hell with all of it  you know what i was jeff i was that wallet  on the surface a reference to some cinematic drivel  but on the inside empty   but you love tarantino  no no not anymore  thats why i wanted to have this dinner with you  this is the first birthday of my new life  you know the wallets cute jeff  but id like to exchange it for a better gift  im not leaving here until youve given me  my first real conversation  yay  okay you want to have a real conversation  heres as real as i get under the circumstances  its nice that youve learned to dial back your love of tv  but id really like you to come have a milkshake with me  but before you do id like you to remember  how much you enjoy pulp fiction  now thats as far as i can go without defeating the purpose  im really tilting the bean can here  pulp fiction milkshakes bean cans  listen to how we talk to each other  were like robots exchanging catchphrases and references  and you think pointing that out counts  as a real conversation  you know how many fake people are talking  about how fake the world is right now  okay well im new at this  so can you start our real conversation  i dont believe theres such a thing  conversation was invented by humans to conceal reality  we use it to sweettalk our way around natural selection  you know who has real conversations  ants  they talk by vomiting chemicals into each others mouths  they get right down to brass tacks  blehh which ways the picnic  blehh that way  humans are more evolved we lie   not all the time   thats a lie   we dont lie when were alone  biggest lie ever  nine out of ten lies occur six inches away  from the bathroom mirror  we do most of our lying alone  hows it even possible to lie when youre alone  you can call a phonesex line   thats lying to yourself  no thats just being honest  with a stranger about being lonely  what if youre dishonest about why youre lonely  what if youre a goodlooking guy who calls a phonesex line  and tells them he weighs 400 pounds  just so he can hear a woman say shes attracted to him anyway   i dont believe that happens  wrong thats me  i did that last week  why would you pay a woman on the phone  to think youre fat  because im scared that if i were overweight  that no one would like me  god that feels good to admit  abed the point being  the point being  you dont have to worry about being normal  or or real or whatever this is tonight  the world is a sick place full of sick sick people  can i tell you something ive never told anyone else  yes  its got to be so cool whatever he got him  you know what im saying wingers a man of means  hes with your boy right now having a fancy dinner  baby chickens diamond forks brandname sodas  then hes gonna bring him back here  give him whatevers in there and thats that  troy who  is that what i think it is  it is  certificate of authenticity  he must have got it on ebay or something  jeff got abed the actual briefcase  from the movie pulp fiction  what are you guys doing  chang made me open it  he seduced me with his dark chinese powers  why do you leave him alone with me  guys i am putting my job on the line  for this stupid party  and the least you can do is not ruin it  no no  dude i know im preaching to the choir  but you are a bad friend  ill kill you  and i said no thats a girls costume  and my mom said its fine  indian boys have long hair and braids too  there was only 45 minutes left to trickortreat  so what could i do  i put the damn thing on and i went doortodoor  and everyone was going oh what a pretty little girl  and by the third house  i stopped correcting them  i mean why draw attention to it  and honestly  once the shame and the fear wore off  i was just glad they thought i was pretty  god this is incredible  i mean to be able to talk this openly  i mean why cant people be like this  i mean whats wrong with this world  what do you want  so this is what youre doing while we wait  just go home pierce the partys canceled  pretty gay man pretty gay  why is pierce dressed as the gimp from pulp fiction  oh  the wallet milkshakes  did you set up a surprise pulp fiction birthday party  yeah at the greasy fork but that doesnt matter now  what matters is this talking  it everything okay  uh yes just the check please  oh im sorry so youre ending early  because in my dinner with andre   the waiter brings  check check check bye   abed   mmhmm  whats my dinner with andre  its just a movie about uh two guys  talking at a restaurant  so this wasnt  a real conversation  you were doing another movie  a movie about a real conversation  did you poop your pants on the set of cougar town  that shouldnt matter  this is why we dont hang out  well thanks for getting me fired jerks   the partys over  cool cool cool cool cool  yeah it is  do you guys know where abeds really cool present is  because im returning it  um its back at the diner its fine  it probably just needs some detailing  man i really wish you two got along better  ooh nono juice  ah thats good nono juice  for the damages  if you promise to give britta her job back  800 and she stays fired  deal  annie told me about the briefcase   thank you   what a waste  not really  did you buy it  from willys 100 authentic cinema treasures on ebay   yep   yeah willy exaggerates  i got indiana jones real whip from him  he moves about 70 of those a year  oh good i thought i flushed  a bunch of money down the toilet  but its great to know that the real pulp fiction briefcase  is safe somewhere  youre mad at me  i spent a week planning a party  just to make you happy  and then i bailed on the party and ruined it  again just to make you happy  then it turns out while i was wasting my time  trying to make you happy  you were making yourself happy all over everyone else  by doing yet another stupid movie spoof  i prefer the term homage  it wasnt about making me happy  i chose my dinner with andre because its about a guy  who has an unexpectedly enjoyable evening  with a weird friend hes been avoiding lately  you think ive been avoiding you  you and i hung out more last year  it makes sense  everyone else is growing and changing all the time  and thats not really my jam  im more of a fastblinking stoic removed  uncomfortably selfaware type  like data  or johnny5 or mork  or hal or kitt or k9  or woodstock andor snoopy  of course spock probably goes without saying  abed i dont need you to grow or change  and take it from someone who just had a meaningless one  sometimes emotional breakthroughs are overrated  and seriously i need you to keep  a tight heavy lid on the little indian girl story   sure   tight heavy lid  cool thl  still friends  because nobody paid for dinner at the restaurant  and i do not have this kind of money  i went back to pay the bill  the restaurant was closed  surprise   surprise   it was abeds idea  the group had stayed behind to salvage the party  the waiter had felt bad for spilling the beans  about abeds homage so he let us stay  as parties go it was quiet dark  and a little lame  wed had better parties and wed had worse parties  but i doubt ill ever forget  my dinner with andre dinner with abed   thanks   abed please   allow me   okay thanks  let me see  mm thats not good  they said market price  what market are you shopping at  im going to run   me too   okay   on three   one   two   three
