                i dont want to be late for lunch  amar is to love right  oh speaking of love  shirley hows it going with the sexy dreadlock guy  oh im sure i dont have a chance with him  abed and i talked to him by the vending machines  he asked about you  he specifically asked about me   mmhmm  sure  when annie brought you up he specifically asked  who is that abed   oh  what thats what he said  abed your social skills arent exactly streets ahead  you know what i mean   i dont  youre not alone in this case  pierce stop trying to coin the phrase  streets ahead  trying  coined and minted  been there coined that  streets ahead is verbal wildfire  does it just mean cool or is it  supposed to be like miles ahead  if you have to ask youre streets fine  okay we can banter if we want to banter  but im warning you i am leaving for lunch early   me too  me three  streets ahead  man you guys really love  these stupid chicken fingers huh  uh theyre not stupid  theyre the only good thing in the cafeteria  i havent had one in weeks they run out so fast  if god were edible not that im catholic  but if it was cool to eat god  hed be a chicken finger   mmhmm  mmhmm  well i wouldnt know  im a vegetarian   shocker  yeah  and if you guys knew how they treated  the animals that you are eating  you would eat them even faster  just to put them out of their misery  and then you would throw up  i dont know  maybe im feeling extra protective  of animals today because my cat is sick   oh a cat  thats awful  he has diabetes  he cant even make it to the litter box   chicken run  whoo  ow  im afraid that im gonna have to put her to sleep  ah go on  god bless you  save some for me  watch out   oh i can hear those fingers calling my name  troy troy  troy did you get my text message  did you get my text message  um i think its  i got to stop hanging out with her  she sounds like a chicken finger  again  outrageous  at least apologize  how can you just stand there like a mute idiot   ooh  well  throat surgery might humanize you  but it doesnt make this acceptable  so cute  and i dont even normally like dreadlocks  hello  his dreadlocks remind me of the predator  which is weird because youre doing the actual hunting  and you seem invisible to him   abed you know what i do  hmm  before i talk i ask myself  what am i about to say  and how might it affect each person listening  im really glad you said that britta  the idea that you compulsively filter yourself  makes your lack of flavor kind of a flavor  sorry guys they ran out again  somethings gotta be done  hey  what the hell man  thats half our problem right there  starburns works the fryer and skims fingers  no way  he gives them to people just so  theyll act like he isnt starburns  well i may not eat meat  but i am not gonna eat that injustice  lets complain  if we complain he gets a warning  and learns to be sneakier  i say we knock him out of the kitchen  and replace him with one of our own  all in one move  then were the ones with the chicken  its like a mafia movie  as far back as i can remember  i always wanted to be in a mafia movie  cool  thats exactly what its like abed  and you get the most important job  youre gonna be fry cook  we may be watching different mafia movies  you worked in your dads restaurant right  well youll apply for the job  after we get starburns fired  i dont know about that  i dont know about the firing  i think he really relies on that income  yeah man  every day you flock here like sheep  and wait in line for a broken promise from a dirty system  back in those days jeff winger  was the guy that made things happen  he always knew what to say  and he always knew when to slap the table  you want to be sheep keep flocking  you want to be wolves form a pack  and that was it it was that simple  at that moment we stopped being a family  and started being a family in italics  britta got cozy with starburns   can i touch both atoh  yeah do em both  he lowered his guard and just like that  he was gone  i mean the way jeff saw it by not respecting us  starburns had basically brought it on himself  and when his job opened up we did what we had to do  to keep the list of applicants to a minimum  i had worked in my dads falafel restaurant  so i had a pretty impressive resume  its very impressive  especially your reference  just give em a call right now  but we werent taking any chances  the fix was in  trump tower this is donald  well he can deepfry the hell out of chicken  i can tell you that  troy even applied for the same job  and gave the worlds worst interview  just to make me look better  and that was that  this was the glorious time  no more racing to the cafeteria  no more lines  to us lines were for suckers  hacks sheep  we were wolves  and we had the chicken to prove it   oh  ooh  to victory  it feels unfamiliar  but it tastes like chicken  mmhmm  hi   hello  you guys are lucky  theyre always running out  would you like one  names shirley memorize it  i will shirley  eee  see that girls  the universe goes by supply and demand  the more you take and use the more it sends  somebodys been taking a little extra  whats in that container   eight fingers  abed  abeds study group  why are you giving chang chicken  we have an agreement  but abed if you get caught skimming  you get fired and we all go back to eating like britta  yeah we put you in that job  i dressed like a crazy pharaoh for you man  you make the fingers abed not the decisions  im sorry  its okay buddy  but just remember these things have power  so just let me know next time  you have any more agreements all right  yeah i agreed to give cheng eight fingers per lunch  in exchange for a 10 bump on every spanish test  for each of us   oh  okay  abed makes the fingers and the decisions   yeah  yeah  oh abed youre like the best  at greendale they were always out of chicken fingers  so whoever could get them had power  oh  and i was the guy in the apron  so i came up with a system and pretty soon  half the chicken at greendale  was going out the side door  everybody in our crew had a job  tbone was the bag man  hed move the fingers to a storeroom  where two of the girls did the packaging  we could trust them not to eat the supply  because britta was a vegetarian  and shirley figured that if she stole  shed go to hell  theyd hand the stuff out the window to annie  she was the leg man and distributor  the crazy thing was it was their food  and we were stealing it and giving it back to them  like it was a big favor  nobody asked any questions because pierces experience  as a ceo had taught him how  to keep the wheels from squeaking  i had it all worked out on a schedule  you know ive never been fired from a job  and this is like my perfect job  im mr chicken fingers  the minute before you thought about busting us  that was the minute you had a chicken in your hand  everyone had their hand out  everyone wanted what we had oh oh well  so we had anything we wanted  and jeff had the most important job of all  he was at the top  he was the boss  he was our leader  what the hell is going on  av kids hooked it up  abed supplied the whole department  with chicken fingers  you think thats good  check out my posse and troys monkey  troy why do you have a monkey  uh its an animal that looks like a dude  why dont i have ten of them  guys look what abed scored for me  ooh  it has a million zippers  and it was free   oh  ooh robot  i am a robot  i am programmed to love this backpack  this is insane  more insane than programming them  to replace auto workers  what  okay okay if youre not in this study group please  no no  that means you sexy dreadlocks  brittas hairdresser what  pierces hackneyed entourage  hackneyed  you see the turban guy  yes in a 90s ski movie  that featured an entourage  dont you guys think this is getting out of hand  oh were not gonna get caught  we have campus security on the take  abeds got it all figured out   mmhmm  well thats a relief  yeah its pretty cool being friends  with the biggest man on campus  isnt that right annies boobs  please rename that thing  and this time not with a contest on twitter  its his twitter account  he can do what he wants  they are my body parts  i do not consent to this  you know what i dont appreciate  you wouldnt threaten a monkey  they have more lactic acid than us  shared my chicken with him   talk to the backpack  i told you  youre the worst annie  streets ahead  line starts behind you  oh hes cool  six fingers every wednesday  cool and what can you offer  i have a bicycle and i teach beginners tennis  cool okay  six fingers wednesdays  all right  well be in touch janel   thank you abed  youre welcome  hey jeff hey buddy  its quite a setup you got here  im pretty excited about it  it turns out everyone has needs  and everyone has functions  look um ive been thinking  maybe i need to hit the big red button  and bring an end to this operation  i mean its been fun but its out of control now  am i right i dont know  the entire campus is controlled by our group  our group is controlled by chicken  and the chicken is controlled by me  float  im good  abed the mafia movie is over  im not doing a mafia movie  in fact i dont need to use movies  or tv shows to talk to people anymore  before i only needed them because the daytoday world  made no sense to me but now  everyones speaking the same language  chicken  i understand people and they finally understand me  abed eventually people are gonna get tired of chicken  im tired of chicken  youre not tired of chicken  you miss the taste of control  well thats crazy  is it  unfortunately the very thing that drove you  to this dorm room is what would prevent you  from properly running this machine  or even being a cog in it  your ego  well  i see i see  this has been about me the whole time  you want a shot at the jeff winger throne  you better bring a powerful ass  oh and for your information i dont have an ego  my facebook photo is a landscape  youre the best eduardo  thank you all for coming  can we make this quick  i need to give a banana to annies boobs  abed is drunk with chicken power  hes gone from lovable johnny five to evil hal   hal holb  not hal holbrook  what are you saying  you all have to stop working for him  let this operation dry up  and let his wheels spin down  at which point you would be in charge again right   what  this is so sad  youre jealous of abed because hes providing for us  mmhmm  no im concerned about abed  because he wont listen to reason  wont listen to your reason  mmhmm  why should he jeffs so not  say streets ahead and die  streets ahead  you want to boss me around  get me an entourage  get troy a monkey  thats what a real boss does  yes  we probably shouldnt even be talking to him  without checking with abed  im already trying him  hes not picking up what did you do with him  i dont believe what greedy sellouts  you people turned out to be  im not gonna stand here and be ignored  shh voicemail  hey abed  jeff says youre not listening to him  does that mean we shouldnt listen to him either  oh also should we make special jackets  for our crime family  like blazers with chicken finger patches  i dont know long message im sorry  thats it   ooh  abed  look im walking out this door right now   okay  okay   for real  good   im not gonna look back  mmhmm   goodbye  goodbye  abed   hi  yes  anybody need anything  oh everything you look handsome  i like everything about you now abed  i want a new hairdresser though  yeah i got you fired  you deserved it  maybe maybe not  the question is what do they deserve  key to the kitchen  theres a valve on the back of the chicken fryer  thats not made anymore  now say someone were to remove it  the fryer wouldnt work  forever  how petty do you think i am  jeff leaving the family didnt turn out to be a problem  okay i think were set for the quiz   yep  see you guys in class  oh wait before you go   oh free notebooks  here  but the familys success started to go to their heads  they didnt have college ruled  no sorry  its okay   abed  yeah  can i talk to you for a minute  sure  we have a situation   hey  who is this  its travis  you said you wanted someone in your entourage named travis  show him your license  travis is his middle name  i go by travis  no you go by the door  see you travis  get it right next time   abed  yep  no no no no  my monkey hates this caviar  troy isnt that  they were spoiled fat lazy  id given them everything and somehow  id lost their respect  so i did the only thing i could think of  i did what i thought jeff would do  i sent them a message  what is that  i think it might be a backpack  thats been mutilated  these were the bad times   there he is  jeff   jeff  jeff   jeff  jeff  abed killed my backpack  and i caught him stuffing my man  full of chicken and tyler perry has a whole series of movies  about why thats wrong  that little arab is off his rocker  he released annies boobs  annies boobs could be anywhere  annies boobs could be on the side of the road  we got it  the monkeys name is annies boobs  look what abed did to my hair  i feel terrible for all of you  wait no i dont because i warned you  about all this but you were so high  on your backpacks and hairstyles  you accused me of being jealous  you were right but what can we do  im sorry you brushed over that first part  together  you were right  now what you can do is go home  and write that on your bathroom mirror  wouldnt that make it seem like i was right  yeah because it would be my mirror  its not gonna be reversed because youre the one who  as for abed for his sake  i guess ill have to take him out  poor little guy  oh good thats nice  abed  what are you doing  making tater tots  you were right people got sick of chicken  but i was close  i just need a new food a new system  im gonna experiment with jalapeno poppers next  and then zucchini zircles i dont get it  its not that complicated jeff  they replaced the c in circle with a z for zucchini  no no i mean why are you here  you said you were close  what were you close to  to the group  to people  please dont do a special episode about me  oh i wouldnt dream of it  everyone else needs my help  thats what people dont get  is that they need to get me  i just need to be able to connect to people like you can  and then i can make everyone happy  like you do  do you know why im here  you got caught with a fake bachelors degree  by the way they started using that  as a seasonal arc on law  order  total rip off  im here to dismantle the fryer  to cut your power off at its source  dont you see what happened  i manipulated the group  into getting you the fry cook job  so i could have some chicken  and you turned it all into a way to make everyone like you  mmhmm  made me ashamed of myself  made me jealous  maybe this is a special episode  its pretty alarming behavior jeff  yeah  you know theres specialists you could talk to  yeah maybe i should do that  mmhmm   in the meantime  mmhmm  lets make a deal  ill help you connect with people  and you help me do a better job with them  like knight rider  exactly like knight rider  deal  ill put on a leather jacket  and make out with an aerobics instructor  you pull around front and comedically  startle passersby with your ability to talk  maybe we should just stay here  and have a plate of chicken fingers  cool  can we eat them while sitting on a table  like in sixteen candles  pick one reference abed  sixteen candles  and just like that the mafia movie was over  i quit the fry cook job  somewhat for the sake of the family  but mostly for the sake of jeffs ego  poor guy  things went back to normal  now everyones back to being a bunch of regular schnooks  and im back to being a weirdo  back to watching from the outside  for now  theres still not enough chicken fingers   no way  what  cause as soon as our family moved out  a new syndicate moved in to take its place  but you know what theyll never make a replacement for  friends  okay thank you thats great abed  but could you just answer the question  what was it  do you know who might have stolen  a box of hairnets from the kitchen  someone with hair  im gonna write that down
