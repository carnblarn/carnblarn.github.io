                city college has a space simulator  we know close the door  as i was saying  on monday city college will be unveiling cccp  the city college cosmic pioneer  their very own orbital launch simulator  pretty soon  they will have an astronaut on their brochure  and we will still be bragging about our foosball table  what do you think happens to enrollment then  i dont know about you gentlemen  but i love my campus and i dont want to watch it  become a city college parking lot  well what can we do  we can launch our own space simulator  before they simulate their launch on monday  we simulate a launch this weekend  we make greendale not city college  the first community college  to pretend to put a man in space  do we even have a simulator  we can get one  in 1980 the county museum  had a stateoftheart space mission simulator  sponsored by kentucky fried chicken  called the kentucky fried chicken  eleven herbs  space experience  gentlemen  greendales future  oh  actually that photos from the past  heres one more current  its seen better days  i admit it could use a good wash  and ive got just the crew  to wash it   can we stop walking in slomo now    you guys are walking in slomo    you guys are an hour late  abed kept making us redo our walk  i think you know the reason  this group has been chosen for this job  to atone  for the obscene entry you submitted  in the greendale schoolflag contest  thats right i know that this isnt a symbol  for the crossroads of ideas  i now know its a butt  yeah keep snickering  pack yourselves with peanuts and really be satisfied  but guess what  this won  this is now our school flag forever  proud of yourselves  how do you know it was our design  we submitted it anonymously  whoops  one of you actually came forward  what  now somewhere beneath this dirt  is greendales newest pride  and my hope is that while you scrub it  you will find the school pride in your hearts  after we clean it can we go inside  no that is a job for some upstanding students  who are training right now in the simulator simulator  great job on this  hard to believe im not really not really in space  i expect this craft to be squeaky clean  in time for the pretend launch  in front of the press at 300  now if youll excuse me  i have to make this into a butt flag  man i remember this thing from high school  during field trips  we used to sneak inside and get  to praying  oh thats nice  we should take a coffee break  lets all get coffee okay  where are troy and abed  im pretty sure they made their way into that thing  five seconds after the dean left  what  hmm its more beautiful than i ever imagined   youve never been in it  my dad never let me  he always had grudge against fastfood restaurants  they almost wiped out his falafel stand  but i memorized every detail of this old girl  on the internet  guys we cant be in here  then get out  wow its pretty well preserved  for something that survived the 80s  and apparently a local transient  who liked to collect doll heads  the 80s  our teen years right everybody  i feel like im underdressed for this  im gonna get something from the dorm  guys seriously  i have to ask that we all step out of here  or what youre gonna tattle on us  like you did with the flag  i didnt tattle about the flag  but you shouldnt have made it in the first place  if you love greendale so much why dont you marry it  im sorry im sorry  im a little claustrophobic thats all  its no big deal as long as im standing near a door  in close situations i get a little nuts  and i dont know you know whats   no no no  hey hey  no  hello  oh  greetings  i am systematic android network diode energy rocket system  but you may call me sanders  sanders sanders this is pierce hawthorne  can i get this door open please  hey look for the handle  theres got to be a handle on the door  you dont know that it was the 80s  everybody who made this was on cocaine  we cant be in here  just as kentucky fried chickens  secret process seals in the flavor  im sealing the cabins air  so you dont explode on your journey   what  what does that mean  please find a seat strap yourself in  and wait for mission control  okay we got to find a handle on this door  guys guys can we just take a mental step backwards  and realize we are simply in a winnebago  and well be fine  oh god  please find a seat strap yourself in  and wait for mission control  im not strapping myself into a coffin  we got to get out of here  i hope you found a seat  i want you to be safe  did you just threaten me  pierce youre talking to an atari cartridge  sit down  this is part of the simulation right  i dont think this is a simulation  i think were being towed   come on  hello  hey guys forget it  whosever towing us cant hear us  you know this is classic greendale  that place deserves an anus flag  can anyone get a phone signal   no  no  mines working but its the black guy  with the wrong number again  pierce i keep telling you that that is an ipod  and you are listening to wesley snipes audiobook  well he sure hates the government  this is a long shot  but maybe if i do this it will solve everything  damn it  this is all my fault   very much so  oh  hey when you go fishing sometimes you catch a boot  wherereyou  telwhereyou are  hello  where are you hoodlums bring my spaceship back  uh we are   although it is possible  yeah its a sticker  hey terrible dean  this thing is being towed with us in it  oh oh okay wait  so handicap spots count on saturdays  assuming we dont wind up in a compactor  when we get back im going to step on you  okay as much as i might enjoy that jeffrey  if you dont get back here in time for the launch  city college wins  and greendale becomes just another school on my resume  that no one can call because it doesnt exist  now tell me where you are  in a moving canister with no phone and no gps  because the only window is sealed shut  hel hello  jeffrey  it isnt sealed shut  hmm  the window isnt sealed shut  it slides open when you complete the simulation  well can you talk them through it  abed if they can open that window  they can tell us where they are and we can find them  i was supposed to be on that thing  i know how she works  hey thats why they need you to bring her home  ill get us some coffee   troy  abed  you can get that window open by doing the simulation  look at the panel on your right  and tell me your recipe  original   how many pieces  6   flavor heading  tasty  we need to get it up to delicious  that makes sense  excellent work captain  now keep your herbs and spices balanced  while the crew helps you with teamwork  guys we can get the window open  if you man your terminals and we complete the simulation  yeah i got a better idea   oh  jeffrey  were all dying  were all gonna die  my readings indicate the need for cooperation  i hate to pull rank on you  but i need you to man your station now jeff  i hate to pull reality on you  but you got your rank captain  by sitting in the chair with the largest knobs  my readings indicate pierce   what  pierce  my readings indicate  youre going to die alone  whys he saying that whys he  whys he saying that to me  uh he hes getting worse  almost there  stop talking old man  you cant make me stop pierce  because troy is killing your life force   i knew it  oh  i knew it  abed  kentucky one  do you read me  kentucky one kentucky one do you read me  kentucky one copy  kentucky come in kentucky  ive worked out a way for them to reroute the power  from the auxiliary battery  reroute to what  everybody  here is the situation  this is greendale  this is the maximum distance from greendale  we can drive to haul them back up here in time  for the simulated launch  and these are city impound lots  any of which might be their destination  what are these other circles  what other circles  looks like you circled public restrooms  and truck stops yeah  theres another one  okay  that is a different side of the map  and that is for a different project  why do they have star ratings   lets get to work people  got it  talk to me buddy come on  uh bro we stopped moving  pierce has got space madness or hes just old or something  theyre locking him up in the back   argh  run jeff  you cant do this to me  we just did  guys please youre becoming animals  oh shut up  we wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for you  thats not true  we werent supposed to be in here when it happened  when what happened  when we got towed  how did you know we were gonna get towed  i set it up  i called city college about transferring  and the dean told me that he would get me in  if i helped sabotage greendales launch  i was supposed to make sure nobody was around  so that they could steal it  and then you guys were late and then  wait wait youre transferring  why  you guys thought that butthole flag was so funny  i mean i respect you all enough to let you hate yourselves  but i respect myself too much to let you hate my school  eh im not buying it  yeah  lets kill her  wait city college was behind this  we have to get back in time for that launch   why  we earned the right  to pick on greendale every day by going there  our school may be a toilet but its our toilet  nobody craps in it but us all yeah   now that was inspiring  seriously  captain  get to your stations  okay   thrusters  full   turbo shield  on   navigation  three   chicken  yeah  ready all ready  suppertime  hold it  congratulations crew  youve worked together  now feast your eyes on the wonders of the cosmos  greendale greendale  everybody be quiet everybody quiet down  quiet down  say again  stand by for location  what do you see gang  we are in  coldwater  here  right next to the truck stop with three thumbs  those arent thumbs  greendale do you copy greendale  im sorry jeff  im afraid  youre out of town  i guess somebodyll come get us eventually  i really miss greendale  how many schools would let you make a butt flag  then actually fly it  how many schools would let you get a degree  in theoretical phys ed  annie  we owe you an apology  nobody should have to choose  between their friends and their school   thanks  mmhmm  but you shouldnt have tattled about the flag  i tattled  i told the dean it was our design  and i told him it was a butt too   what  why jeffrey  he kept not seeing it i mean it was driving me crazy  it says e pluribus anus  i told you we should have put cheeks on it  theres a time and place for subtlety  and that time was before scary movie  hey guys  im feeling a lot better now  well you you sound good  yeah you know in a weird way  being in a smaller place like this  i was able to work through some things  i think im ready to come out  ill kill you  i will kill you sanders   congratulations  come on man come on  let go  no  get off my mommy im her man  pierce stop stop it calm down  whos feeling skinny  dean the press

craig  stephen  im surprised to see you here  you dont think id miss your moment of triumph do you  greendale beating city college into simulated space  unless  youre having trouble locating your ship  you  you were behind this  the next time you provoke city college  you will lose more than a winnebago  greendale come in greendale  go ahead kentucky  you can call off the rescue  were coming to save you  come on you familysized bucket of bolts  abed construction on spring road  i see it left on apple valley  annie left on apple  hold tight   hi  hi   hi  get off of me  theyll never make it back craig  that thing might as well be on a simulation of the moon  oh you know wha  ah yes  hey look out   whoo  what just happened  ladies and gentlemen  returning from their maiden simulation  the fabulous greendale greenstronauts  well annie  i suppose youre not city college material after all  thank you   annie  good job  thats good  just to say could you hold on one second  great job up there captain  really  you think i could be a real astronaut someday  well if nasa ever needs someone  to keep an arrow inside of a moving rectangle  i know who id recommend  abed  want to ta a seat in the captains chair  i think youve earned it  no thanks i cant imagine anything  that could have been cooler than what ive done today  okay that was cool  in the future  mission control headed for base  target acquired  mission control ive got a bogie on my 6  yeah im on your 6  evasive maneuvers  still on your 6  i took evasive maneuvers you cant be on my 6  then im on your 12  that means im
