movie  thank you for telling me that in the last session dumbass  now look  there are bugs on the windshield of your mind  you may never be able to squeegee  like a certain birthday party  attended by a rather enterprising transient  in a dinosaur costume  but there are other more recent streaks  that you might yet be able to wipe clear  like your adolescent fear  of being a socalled blowup doll  i really think this nomination may actually help that  so you think id feel better about myself  if i got all sexed up went over there  and really tried to be crowned queen of the dingbats   precisely  wow  guess you really get what you pay for with free therapy  ouch that stung a little bit  thanks   oh  oh  ill save you some time  he listens to you talk for a year  then recommends a makeover  well
