question  and its important to students like jeremy  who told me today that he is majoring in astronomy  and is supporting two children  its an important question to maria  whos a beautiful latina  born in nicaragua working in the cafeteria  what will i do dean  these people dont want me to say what ill do  they want me to do what ill say  they love it when you shuffle the words around  magnitude  same question  same answer  mind if i ask you a few questions  was there a reason you had to repeat the first grade  well i didnt know how to use scissors i sat in the middle of the seesaw

guy  read my lips  no matter what youre told  we have to clean the mold  no matter what youre told  we have to clean the mold thats right people  no matter what youre told  we have to clean the mold  this is interesting annie edison has reduced her platform  to one issue and turned that issue into a sound bite  and it rhymes  and people love it  this elections become a horse race according to our polls  the campus is almost evenly divided  keep in mind the margin of error is about 98  could be higher we dont know how to do margins   we talked to two people  were taking a quick break   stay

until i saw you running away crying  i care what you think about me you know  i care what you think about me  thats why this happened  resolved then  resolved  when we seek to destroy others  we often hurt ourself  because it is the self that wants to be destroyed  youre not usually so poignant  vicki finally lent me her pencil  go to the health center  weve finally reached the end of election road  arguments have been made pops have been popped  hearts have been stirred perhaps broken  the only thing that remains is to tally the vote in this matchup  between the youthful charismatic magnitude  and the leonard the human raisin rodriguez  two men fighting for the same piece of earth  one recently born one soon to die  a competition reflecting the pointlessness of life  pull up youre in a nosedive  im being told now that dean pelton is prepared to announce a winner  lets go to the room  okay here we go  thank you sergio  with 11 votes cast   the landslide winner  of the student election  with seven votes is  south park  okay you know what  this is why we abolished student government in the first place  this is exactly what happened ten years ago  how hard is it to get rid of black mold  what do we need buckets and sponges  i dont actually know  well look it up  my lady  there you have it  in a shocking writein upset  the comedy central cartoon series south park  has been elected president of the greendale student body  not that shocking to me i voted for it  for real me too  we can never stop being friends  as the confetti gets swept away we begin gearing up for next election  for gctv im abed nadir saying  did you know you could make napalm out of common dish soap and cat food  what  why would you say that  vohlers  sorry were gonna have to move on to city
