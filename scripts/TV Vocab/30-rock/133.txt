new harriet tubman movie  and i got octavia spencer to play the lead  harriet something  you know i once played frederick douglass  in a onewoman show  that the university of maryland diamondback called  too confusing to be offensive  point is i wont be at rehearsal  at all this week no tracy  exactly no tracy  thanks for being so understanding   good morning jack  hank  i was so sorry to hear about your mother  thank you hank  i remember my own mothers passing  she wanted to be cremated  and she ended up dying in a fire  such a considerate woman  well on a brighter note  i should wish you a happy birthday  no no its not my birthday yet  and it only counts when its actually on your birthday  i have very strict birthday rules  one birthday boy always sleeps in the largest tiger cage  some of the rules may be specific to my time in vietnam  now jack as you know  the kabletown board is meeting this friday  i promised my wife id step aside  when i turned 70  but its very important to me that control of kabletown  stays in the hooper family  but my kids are creative types  yes i understand that hank jr is writing  a childrens book about a giraffe  who learns he doesnt have to work hard  but they say sometimes it skips a generation  i think you know my granddaughter  sir kaylie is only 15  yeah but when she gets out of college shell be 21  thats the same age i was when i started kabletown  got married and had my first white child  hank please think about your other options  jack youve done an excellent job with nbc  i admit i was skeptical  when i first saw your fall schedule  what is this guy trying to tank the company  but boy you proved me wrong  celebrity homonym is the numberone show in america  the word is racket  okay racket like a tennis racket  sorry its the other one  again you know what pal  why dont you come over here and tell me that  i am grateful  thats why i came up with a solution  that will make everyone happy  until kaylie graduates youll be her assistant ceo  assistant  ceo  shell be on the board learning the ropes  and youll keep her chair warm  itll work great just like conan and jay  have you ever updated your flash player  it is so sad  what happens to version 114   what now  im taking hormone shots  to have a baby you son of a bitch  a beautiful little baby  being a woman is the worst  lemon hank hooper just told me  i will never be ceo of kabletown  but he doesnt know about my secret weapon  my mothers death   wait so were both crazy  no  ive spent my life trying to win my mothers approval  but she never gave it to me  which means i cant ever stop trying  even when faced with an impossible task  like making hank choose me over his own granddaughter   how much time do you have  three days  its exactly the kind of challenge  my mothers antilove prepared me for  ill make you proud of me yet colleen  itll either be my masterpiece  or i will resign in shame  just like poor nixon  he did good things in china  hey  octavia excellent youre black  now in this scene  youre gonna enter through the door  i dont think so  im gonna walk in from over here  but the door  well youre just gonna have to rewrite the script  and explain how my character can go through walls  also i want to wear a tshirt promote my website  but slaves didnt wear tshirts  that sounds like a tracy problem tracy  im done for the day  i got to go home and feed my eels  theyre not electric but i have a plan  mizz dotgov lets roll  len im in the endgame here with this kabletown situation  do you have anything on kaylie for me  well mr donaghy you asked me  to pull out all the stops on this so i went deep undercover  and i applied for a job as a drama teacher  at kaylies school  hi im ms foster  but please call me jan  boy jayz and shakespeare have nothing in common  or do they  fyi jan foster is currently in a lesbian relationship  with ms siegal from the math department  okay i dont know why you had to be a woman  let me worry about that  the point is jan took these pictures  this morning outside school  she thinks youll be very interested in them  banks  pedal faster fatties  god i love how much you disgust me  class dismissed  really banks spin class  isnt that a bit of a gay cliche  youre the gay one  wanting to be with a woman how gay is that  you win sex against a man  thats as straight as it gets  you were good one of the best  but look at you now  hitching your wagon to a 15yearold girl  look i understand why kaylie would seek you out  no one knows me better  but you also know that jack donaghy always wins  or have you forgotten the time we played battleshipb  remember a8  you peeked  why are you here jack  to propose something  something no one would ever expect  an alliance  think about it  how much time and energy have we wasted  with our sparring and our gravelvoiced double entendres  an assload  if we joined forces  we could become the greatest business power duo  since gregory linens teamed up with thomas nthings  and whatever kaylies offering ill double it  ill tell you what kaylies offering me  my mouth shut  keep your mouth shut what do you mean  i know certain things jack about kaylies father  certain supergay things  hanks son is gay  how gay banks  on a scale from bear hunting to hunting bears  gay enough that kaylies parents have never actually had  heterosexual intercourse  word is kaylies real father is the poole boy  do you know him  frederick pooles grandson trevor  very handsome horrible personality  im totally in love with him  but if kaylie isnt really hanks granddaughter  then she isnt actually family  and once shes out of the picture  youre the only choice to take over kabletown  and youre gonna take me with you  but how do we prove kaylies not a hooper  all we need is dna  ive got a ton of her dads  so we just need kaylies  hi bev its liz  liz  yeah definitely dont give me your last name  because i only deal with one person a year  so i know exactly who you are  its elizabeth lemon  ive been on the agencys list for a few years now  i wanted to see if you got my letter  updating my marital status  yes congratulations  youve moved from the wellmeaning lesbian pile  to found a man comma living a lie  that brings your wait time down to only four years  four years  so ill be 46 by the time i get a baby  unless youd like to adopt an older child  i can give you a sixyearold yesterday  pick a color  i just always pictured myself getting a newborn  and i always pictured myself  getting doubleteamed by two the rocks  but sometimes we have to make compromises  let me know if you change your mind  jack how old is too old for a woman to have a baby   look i have three options  if i still want to start a family  theres the oldfashioned way  but these hormone treatments are the worst  and even if they work at my age  the kid might just come out a ball of fingers  steve forbes was born a ball of fingers  he had the best surgeons money can buy  but you can still tell  so option two is adopting a baby  but i have to wait four more years  ill be almost 70  when she graduates from college  which just leaves option three adopting an older kid  but i dont think i can handle that  really wouldnt that be easier  than taking care of an infant  no with a baby you know what youre getting  with an older kid who knows  for every orphan annie theres a 30yearold russian dwarf  whos just pretending to be a child  according to a movie that i watched part of  we are both at a crossroads lemon  i have chosen my path its time you do the same  hello partner  whats happening here  whats happening to your left blob   its the hormones  lemon thanks to banks  i have reason to believe that kaylie  is not her fathers daughter  the reason being a weeklong party  in stephen sondheims sex dungeon  the workmanship down there is exquisite  but it took forever  renovations in new york  the point is when hank finds out  that kaylies not family  my god are you planning on telling hank  just so you can get a promotion  not just a promotion ill be ceo  and ill be nbcs head of publicity  youll never see me again ill be on a beach somewhere  i know this is important to you  but you are off the rails jack  thanks for the compliment lemon  train travels for hoboes  what youre doing makes no sense  youre teaming up with devin  hey listen ive changed lemon  the only backstabbing i do now is  well you know  every time i think were done with that we find another one  youre trying to tear apart a family  youre in a blood feud with a teenage girl  all she wants to do is talk about boys and text on her phone  and if shes like me sit in a closet  with a flashlight and memorize airport codes  her phone lemon youre a genius  thats how we get kaylies dna  teenage girls cant stop looking at their phones  its like me with paintings of cannons  yes her dnas all over that phone of course  but how can we get close enough to steal it  we need a teenage girl  or someone who thinks like one  damn it why do i keep helping you  ill just do anything for approval  i would have been a nazi  who do we know whos immature and vicious enough to  lets destroy her  now what can i do for you two gentlemen  hello mr director   so hows the movie going  terrible  octavia wont do anything i tell her to do  she left early  shes completely unprofessional  i dont know tray  sound like she acting like you  but im impossible to deal with  no one has ever been able to rein in my hilarious antics  liz lemon does it every day and looks great doing it  okay so i should just act like her  wwrxw  what would liz lemon do  kaylie hooper  to what do i owe the pleasure  jack pleasures the name of a pony i hate  this is business  so i just happened to bump into

at the maury povich show  kaylies not hanks granddaughter  i knew it  would you like to  do the honors  look how far weve come jack  from enemies to partners to who knows  come on lets get a couple of wines in you  and just start wrestling  yeah the whole cabin vibe wasnt working for me  and this movie cannot take place in maryland  because of my ongoing feud with cal ripken  blargh im liz lemon

what are you doing  fyi kaylie is my best friend  so i sit next to her at the movies  why cant she just sit in the middle  jack  sweet sweet jack  you wanted this so badly  you were willing to believe anything  that devin would team up with you  that i wouldnt notice miss foster  sit on her testicles the other day  that my father is gay  i am hank hoopers granddaughter jack  but what about the dna the glass  you mean the glass i stole from jennas dressing room  that was jennas dna jack  so jenna is an ashkenazi jew with an extra y chromosome   whats that now  it was so simple  and when you made your move with jenna  all i had to do was see straight through it  come back here and plant that glass  you got the dna results you were hoping for  and sent them straight to poppop  this is why everyone hates you jack  we were all talking about it before at the mall  how do you think old hank hoopers gonna take that  you attempting to destroy his family  theres nothing poppop cares more about than family  god what have i done  goodbye jack  see you never  yeah jack see you never  last word  yes i suppose thats one way this could have played out  but there are other possibilities  hypothetically what if i never trusted banks at all  what if i knew len would be the worst mole ever  ill tell him you said that  and what if i knew the dna gambit was bait  and i never sent in those test results at all  well thats impossible  i mailed them myself did you  okay  so you didnt do anything at all  well thats idiotic  kabletown board is meeting tomorrow  and youve done nothing to change poppops mind  you just wasted a whole week  not quite kaylie  because i did send something to hank  a birthday card   my god no  yes  you see there is one thing  hank cares about as much as
