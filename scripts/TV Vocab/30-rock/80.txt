woman ever created  like a young bo derek stuffed with a barry goldwater  you sound weird do you have a beard  not for long its back to reality  no more making love on the beach  surrounded by a privacy circle of englishtrained butlers  but ive got to get out of island mode  and back into work mode  how was your summer  get this my gynecologist committed suicide  and im back  carol  hey

kabletown we have to seem like  a sexy profitable company  and were almost pulling it off  the harry potter theme park is a huge hit  with both anglophiles and pedophiles  the movie division has a james cameron movie  the whole world will see whether they like it or not  only nbc continues to be the engorged whitehead  on the otherwise flawless face of universal media  lemon why are you spending so much money on wigs  tracys head size keeps changing  hang on what is this pay increase for jenna  oh boy  look as we enter the fifth season of tgs  and remember no one ever thought wed make it this far  i believed in us  that was actually an oversight  jenna has some crazy stuff built into her contract  that kicks in now  like what  eye contact  everyone must make eye contact  with miss maroney at all times  she also gets a producer credit what  oh its just a vanity credit lemon  a lowcost way to make someone feel more important  like executive producer ashton kutcher  or secretary of state hillary clinton  am i late for the producers meeting  eye contact  thank you   hey kkkk  first day backs gonna be a busy one  first i need you to go to the dry cleaners for me  and find out how martinizing works  ive always been curious  then i need you to be back by noon  to make the bathroom smell like sandalwood  before i wreck it  you got that kpaxogum  im not kenneth sir  my names brian  kenneth got fired at the end of last season  of course i knew that  good meeting   so how are things with carol  good  did you know that if youre a pilot  that chilis will seat you right away  even if the pilots dinner companion  has just been yelling at the hostess  you are the jackie o of our time  and pilots get all these travel points  at starwind hotels  the one in midtown has free internet  he doesnt stay with you when hes here  why would he those starwinds are nice  i mean the bathtubs are so much cleaner than at home  its almost as bad as climax  you cant just do the vacation part  at some point you have to go home to the same house  unpack your dirty laundry and have a life together  then one of you says we should redecorate  and the other one says please avery  im using the commode right now  ooh she wants to redecorate she just moved in  avery uh has opinions i love her for that  unfortunately she wants to repaint  the upstairs hallway in a strie faux finish  called husk  i prefer the color thats already there  a reddishbrown shade called elk tongue  so tell her no its your house  this is how i know youve never had  an adult relationship  if i say no then i will be required  to say yes to something else in the future  and the stakes in the future might be higher   then say yes  if i give in  then im no longer the alpha in my house  before you know it shell have me wearing jeans  and reading fiction  yeah well yes and no are kind of  your only two choices  for most men sure but there is a third option  the fabian strategy i know this  if an apple and a feather fall at the same time  the fabian strategy derives its name  from the roman general quintus fabius maximus  he ran away lemon rather than engage in battle  he would retreat and retreat until the enemy grew fatigued  and eventually made a mistake  although i abhor it as a military strategy  it is the basis for all of my uh personal relationships  so avery is your enemy that sounds healthy  youre in no position to judge  meeting someone in a hotel room twice a month  is not a relationship just ask any hooker  oh stop saying relationship  im sorry  i was going to say climax aah  a line item budget  oh i love this  it takes people and turns them into amounts of money  except for tracy im the most person on the show  at do we do now  oh okay well jack wants me to keep the budget flat  but i dont want to deny people their raises  you should fire grace from wardrobe  she doesnt do anything fire grace  come on youd have to be a heartless monster  ill do it  grace your position has been terminated  effective immediately  but ive been here since the jack paar show  your health insurance will remain in effect  until the end of this sentence  come on chop chop  what a shank job  kenneth i knew youd come back  let me smell your head  mmm come on  this is a womans blazer  from a very expensive blazer shop called ricos  im sorry but my heart is playing tricks on my eyes  just like my kidneys did to my lungs that time  are you okay  i keep hallucinating kenneth  am i going crazy again  should i get my rainbow wig out of storage  no tracy its normal  kenneth was very special to you and now hes gone  the next time you hallucinate just tell yourself  this is not real i am in control of this  like the world cup  ill try    no this place is too full of memories  i gotta clear my head  okay well weve only been back to work like an hour  and bye  liz get in on this  would you rather have to start every sentence you say  for the rest of your life with urkels catchphrase  did i do that  or be siamese twins with sharon stone for a year  did i do that  carol  so carol  you ever join the mile high club  try five miles high and no i have not  did you ever see a ufo up there  no but once when i was in the air force  i saw mr t in a pizza hut  was the air force like top gun  yeah but with a lot more volleyball  you ever kill anyone  sucked a mechanic into my engine once  are you on facebook  and these are for you  passenger left them in the firstclass lavatory  ooh  hey i couldnt get a room  at any of the starwinds this weekend  you think itd be all right if i stayed at your place  uh uh yeah of course  ill just have to run home first  and take some plates out of the bathroom  but it would be nice  staying together at your place right  yeah itll be a fun step for us  i just cant believe that every starwind suite  in the city is taken  me neither the lady said theyre all booked up  for something called jackfest  how many rooms did you book  its for your own good lemon  i just want you to have what avery and i have  i am a grown woman  i have been doing things my way for a long time  i dont like my life stuff mixing with my dude stuff   a middleaged woman saying dude stuff  is that on my sadness scavenger hunt  why yes it is  carol and i enjoy  our separatebutintersecting lifestyles  its perfect  im like that woman on the food network  whose husband only comes home on the weekends  and she spends the rest of her time  eating and drinking with her gay friends  her name is the barefoot contessa lemon  and you will never be like her  starting with the barefoot part  ill have you know that i wore sandals this summer  over socksin a dream  welcome to the late show with david letterman  please have your tickets out  and now as with all studio audiences  we will sort you according to attractiveness  front front back  balcony front front  mr jordan  no you do not exist  im in control of this  want to watch tv  first thing you need is tequila  stop wait no  the barefoot contessa i love this show  me too  this is one of the three things in the world i like  ina garten sweater weather and  when muppets present at award shows   wow yes  me too  we really see eye to eye on a lot of stuff dont we  absolutely ive never met anyone before  who had the exact same idea as me  about what to do with palestine   it would work right  of course it would work  and dont you agree that our situation  is perfect right now  we have these great visits together  but then we still have our separate lives  were like jeffrey and ina  no no i cant i cant live like this anymore  im not like jeffrey garten  im not as strong as that guy  dont have too much fun without me okay  i need to know where this relationship is going  and i can feel you resisting it  no no it okay  dont be cry  im a pilot liz  you know ive spent my entire adult life  just casual girlfriends in different cities  i i cant go from woman to woman to woman anymore  how many women have you been with  id rather not say its shameful  i mean im a pit  six  oh thats not so great   i want grownup love   hello  thanks  carol had a complete meltdown  about the state of our relationship  i cant believe i tried to clean my bathtub for this  no this is healthy lemon where is carol now  i finally got him to sleep  i had to spoon him for like an hour  and i was the outer spoon  welcome to adulthood  as for me i have successfully retreated  for another day  when avery got home from work  i noticed that she had some paint samples in her purse  so i immediately asked her if her sister had done  anything crazy lately and guess whatshe had  avery talked about that for about an hour  her anger eventually transforming  into some rather interesting sex  and now shes sleeping peacefully  while fabius has retreated to his den  where he is drinking scotch and playing snood   uhhuh does averys work email go right to her phone   why  nothing  just sending her a link to this cool site  funkyvintagewallpapercom  lemon dont she keeps her blackberry in bed with her   and send  damn it lemon  it has to be elk tongue  oh  eww no  this jenna promotion is the greatest thing  that has ever happened to me  do you understand how much free time i have now  yesterday i went to the gym  and this morning i made love to my wife  and she was still asleep so i didnt have to be gentle  thats one of the most upsetting things  i have ever imagined  are you sure think about it again  yes  liz the writers cant take a car service at night anymore  ive crunched the numbers and its cheaper for us  to just replace anyone who gets murdered  so did avery like my wallpaper idea   she did heh heh  huhso why are you happy  because the fabian strategy is working  every new pattern avery showed me  i would simply say yes i like that one too  and she was so overwhelmed with the choices  that she made a mistake  she suggested that we consult her old college friend  whos an interior designer  uhhuh  hes coming here to meet with me today  his name is james  not jim not jimmy  jamessss i get it  shes sending her army into unknown territory  and i am flanking her with these  have you seen my eyes lemon  yep theyre very blue  like a mikonos sky  mark foley once called them piercing  hmm  avery has really made a misstep here  do you know what a prize i am in the gay community  theres a term for it im a bearand im a  im a daddy bear  just one hour of flirty chatting with james  and you know what ill get  not a glaad award i know that  elk tongue  well im glad to hear that youve almost  vanquished your girlfriend thank you  and you versus carol hows that going  i dont know we had a pretty emotional breakfast  he says hes leaving early now  i dont know what to do i know its difficult lemon  but now you have an adult decision to make  would you rather let go of your precious autonomy  and let carol into your life  or would you rather teach your cat to dial 911  first of all im tired of playing would you rather  and second of all you know that i have life alert  oh i pushed it i need a phone  mr jordan mr jordan please stop  youre not real  if i threw you in front of a car  it would drive right through you  no nosir  i am real  would an imaginary me know that you have a mole  on your list of pets to get  or that your favorite color is rainbow  of course it would it would know anything i knew  because it sprung from my imagination  sir its really me  oh my god  oh no i missed it do it again  i love you kenword  why dont you come back home to tgs  and pick the peas out of my fried rice  and the rice i just want carrots  i cant do that sir  but dont you miss rubbing my foot  back into the shape of a foot  of course i do  but im real happy here at cbs  they gave me a tote bag with the mentalist on it   i guess this is goodbye  obviously im going to need the tote bag  james tell me  which one of these do you like  because with my untrained eyes  the strie is bland and the uh  wallpaper just looks busy  ohi dont know  do you see something uh here that you like  its so frustrating    i think i found a way  to get the budget down to where jack wants it  thats my girl you are en fuego  i was looking it over and ive realized something  theres one too many producers pete  okay i get it  but please i have five kids  that i dont want to be at home with  no pete its me  as great as i am at this im not really necessary  hmm the last time i said that  i was in a threeway with two of the backstreet boys  no jenna you cant quit  ill take a pay cut  we can fire liz  this is hard for me too pete  but its because im a genius producer  i know that you have to fire me  take my producing fee and amortize it  to cover the gaps in transport and electric  hey liz would you rather   oh  be with the person  you love forever  but you always have to wear a shirt  made out of their pubes  or be alone for the rest of your life  but you get to wear whatever you want  shirt of pubes  i thought you left  i came back  i mean i had to kick an obese teen off the flight  to get a seat but i really wanted to talk to you  look im not sorry you saw me cry  im an emotional guy  thats actually not even part of my personality  thats just something that happens to people  who change altitude more than four times a day  is that also why you got so mad  watching the giants game  no that was because  why does geico have three different spokespeople  they have the caveman the lizard  and then the stack of money with the eyeballs  and the fake rod serling guy  oh my god right thank you  i mean you see how good we are together  look liz i want this  but if were gonna go for it  we gotta move forward a bit with each visit  two

youre getting to keep your wall elk tongue  actually no the fabulous james and i  came up with an excellent idea  were taking that wall down  that way we can make the master bedroom closet bigger  and gain a nice architectural symmetry  huh you think maybe thats what avery wanted all along  oh my god  hannibal defeated fabian with a decoy army  james was a plant  the strie wall finish was a decoy  she hannibaled my fabian  lemon avery and i are perfect together  likewhiskey and hunting  soul mate doesnt even begin to do it justice  shes my  shes your pube shirt  pube shirt  thats our show good
