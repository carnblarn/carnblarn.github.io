valentines  a second chance this year  and here we are on six for the first  what a shame  it felt like we were just getting started  ma  s06 ep 06  hey baby whats wrong   hazel most people think of valentines day  as a celebration of the burning of a catholic loudmouth but  its also about love  and escort prices going way up  okay so how appropriate that on valentines  i introduce you to the new love of your life  this job and everyone here  this is kind of the nerve center of tgs the page desk  ive had a desk before  i managed a haunted house upstate  but as you know  the haunted house industry is a real boys club  sure its hard  changing careers at my age  well i wouldnt know anything  about being too old for something  but here i am in new york living at a 24 hour fitness  just

guy to get liz lemon on board  with saint lameentines nay  honey that sucks  we better be able to survive a simple trip to ikea  no liz dont test it  especially this early in a relationship  its like when mickey rourke tested his catapult on me  i was almost listening  where are you going  you never take my advice  ms maroney  thank you kenneth  well take a pube count but it doesnt feel worth it  maybe im hitting them too hard  and i should not have walked past that sporting goods store  where the mannequins have nipples  and what race were those mannequins  because their skin was gray  they

discuss  it has been months and i feel like nothing has happened  diana  extracting an american from north korea is a uh  is a lot more difficult than organizing  a roundrobin paddle tennis tournament  what about organizing  three roundrobin paddle tennis tournaments  i heard that one of them was a disaster  who told you that  bebe butler  shes trying to destroy me  this situation has become embarrassing  one of fredericks old washington friends  has some connections with the transylvanian consulate  at the united nations  i made an appointment for both of us  let me stop you right there  ive been to the un repeatedly  mein herr meine frau avery jessup  kim jongil vuvuzela  charlize theron  boomerang my sheila back  to her joey mate  and its gotten me nowhere  the un is a useless organization  with a ridiculous army  robins egg blue helmets  great camouflage  if youre invading an easter egg hunt  jack perhaps youre not having success  because of that attitude  i find you catch more flies with honey  first of all why do you want flies  our appointment is at 1100  strewth what a bulldingered  valentines day  and jack  i speak australian  let ferry ride  was the first time

pick lowhanging fruit  we look like far side drawings  so we go where women are sad desperate and weak  cat shelters blood banks the ice cream stand  at a celtic woman concert and we strike  another good place is the beauty salon  where white girls try to do black hair  sisters come out crying feeling all bad about themselves  and we walk up on them all  hey baby whats wrong  youre married i

have organized several dog and pony shows  and im offended by what youre implying  how are you averys mother  we have a few things in common jack  we both married much much older men  which can be hard  or more often flaccid  i have an idea maybe we just dont talk at all  maybe we sit quietly and read our  soccer magazine  mr jordans lizard jeremy  is always escaping and biting everyone  like owner like lizard  oh man  thats why mr jordan got him a gps collar  now its easier to find  well that cant be  it says hes inside the room  maybe youre reading it wrong  three feet two feet  it says hes right on top of us  oh my god my face  hes mating with my mouth  he likes you  heres a good one  go to a strip club on fathers day  and shout things like  im proud of you  classic  wheres pete  i just dyed my gums because i want them to pop on camera  but now theyre burning  another way to meet damaged women  is to hang out with actresses  actresses  where how young are they  ill do nudity  back in the day used to work as a stock boy  in a chic uptown department store  called rayrays discount clothes bucket  i would go to the swimsuit section  and switch the tags  id take a size six and put a size twelve sticker on it  and then some thick girl would try to squeeze into it  and come out of the dressing room like  ive gotten bigger why do i even bother dieting  and im all like  hey baby whats wrong  you know a great place to meet vulnerable women is weight watchers  i did watchers to stay pageantfit  but it was too much math for a sixyearold  thank god i found cigarettes  weight watchers got it  and if worse comes to worse  make the lady feel vulnerable  check this out  baby did someone throw cereal on you  lets get you out of these wet clothes  what is wrong with you people  whatever  jeremy says shes a tease anyway  now lets hit weight watchers  how is there no signal in here  silence prisoner  i mean can i help you valued customer  there you are  what are you doing  buying stuff for tonight  to make it awesome  look salt and pepper shakers  you put them together it makes a heart  take them apart two red sperms  were not getting that  whats with the neggy vibes jeez  i can get things  not if youre not paying for them  lets go get that table buddy  ikea  first things first  i am from transylvania  but i am not a vampire  im just a night owl with a terrible garlic allergy  so this is regarding that boy  who went missing in my castle  no were here about my wife  my daughter avery jessup shes in north korea  yes the jessup case  yes i would like to speak to kim jongun immediately  that is unacceptable  i understand  the operator wouldnt let me dial longdistance  so thank you both for coming  no  that is exactly what i expected would happen  does that hurt  well im so sorry  well that is just the beginning youpenis  this isnt some idiotic civil war  in some country without oil  this is my favorite daughter  and she is a beautiful white american  so why the fudge isnt  everyone fudging freaking the fudge out  shes right  you are a penis  im going to call security  one of the guys has a whistle  vampire push  did you just threaten her  i want you to apologize to this woman right now  i am a very powerful man  i can see to it that transylvania  never sees another episode of friends  no monica and chandler just slept together in london  im im sorry  okay now admit the un is useless  it is half the building is a laser tag arena  admit its annoying when bono comes around  its the worst  every time he says hes not hungry when we collect money  for pizza and then he eats like three slices  you disgust me  come on lets go  and cjokula  at monica and chandlers wedding  rachels the one who is pregnant  finally tables  stop walking so close to me  im sorry  its this place  but also if you would just let me get a few steps  ahead of you first and then you walk  i found it  nice  what  its nice its just  i dont know if im feeling it you know  what about this idea  i know a guy who cuts glass  no i took measurements  i looked at colors we came here  this is the plan  yeah its just that this table  it feels kind of uptight  and i think something a little more fun  would be a better table for me  well i dont know criss  maybe a more fun table wouldnt be as supportive  what no no we are not doing this  we are not letting this table  be a metaphor for our relationship  thats what ikea wants us to do  im just not sure my chair wants to be with this table  why because deep down your chair  would rather be with other chairs  i think the table  needs to stop listening to its mother  well its just the table thinks the chair  takes too many camping trips with richard  almost there teammate  to the warehouse  seriously  zoo york  okay everybody sound check for ms maroney  no i dont want a live band  live bands make mistakes  pete i have made love to alfonso  he cant keep rhythm get him out of here  thats a wrap on alfonso  alfonso disparioso everybody  this is your moment  the world breathes for you  i love you myself  and playback  jenna youre not singing  yes i am  im sorry i was such an italian in there  but that was unacceptable  no you were wonderful  the way your eyes went dead just like averys  i didnt know you had that in you  yosemite sam was based on my grandfather  so yes i do have a temper  there are a lot of things you dont know about me jack  in 1978 i was in playboy just wearing a necktie  and holding hands with a black girl  how could i have ever said  that youre not your daughters mother  those incredible cheekbones like an evil disney queen  no i misjudged you  the way you broke that man down  like a folding table at a dog and pony show  and i am sorry i compared you to my late husband  you are not some liverspotted old man  constantly spilling hot tea in his lap  until his whole crotch was useless  useless  you are young  you are virile  your hair like a lions mane  my eyes like two pools of ice water  lets keep walking  in the cold  yes  do you like baseball lets talk about baseball  i love baseball abner doubleday   the bats are long and hard  the gloves are girls   balls  jeters thighs in those pants  new topic  you know its funny  if those teeth were in your vagina  youd be considered a monster  well jenna theres nothing physically wrong with you  thats impossible  why cant i sing  well it must be psychosomatic  dont worry thats just a fancy doctor word  for your brain is broken  unfortunately theres no field of medicine  that deals with the brain  but i can give you a pamphlet for a cult  you dont understand  this is how i make my living  like me and my cell phone bedazzling  i have to be able to sing  maybe youre shutting down because of all the pressure  there is a lot riding on this performance  pressure thats ridiculous  pressure is trying to pass for four  when you just turned seven  at the miss toddler panama city pageant  youre crammed into the same fiveinch heels  you wore the year before blood pooling in your toes  but you know if you dont win  mom cant fix the hole in the gator fence  so youll be up all night  stabbing gators  pressure is performing on a party boat  that catches on fire  your throat burning from the smoke  you still sing so beautifully that it calms the passengers  so that you and the crew can escape  pressure  its the rule of threes pete  is singing the yemeni national anthem  while a handsome but ruthless general pushes a scimitar  into your neck  kristin chenoweths corpse at your feet  thats pressure  this live show is nothing  well theres something weird going on here  you feel that sexual energy too  i mean but it would be wrong to act on it  well its 500 somewhere  no this isnt happening theyre sold out  this is why you dont just choose one option  we were in a room full of tables  no this is why you dont waste 45 minutes  wandering around the valentines marketplace  trying to find stuff for tonight  for you really cool stuff  you still have those salt and pepper shakers dont you  well i dont want them anymore  cause im not feeling romantic  god you actually got me excited about today  valentines is the worst  its even worse than earth day  you just see so many dirty feet in sandals  i dont know liz  this could have been special  i had stuff planned  no you didnt  you wrote half a song and thought youd wing it  like you do with everything  i mean if youd had a plan  we wouldnt even be in this hellhole  good go wide with it go  really  well hows your superplanned life going liz  youre 40something  one come on criss  you have no kids  the only thing you like about your job  is taking home free sodas  and youre attacking the only good thing in your life  because of a stupid table  this isnt about the table  this is about you never following through on anything  ever  its why you didnt finish law school  its why you still arent done filling out your 2010 census  well what race am i supposed to check  we all come from africa  you know what  ikea tested us we failed  okay just go  thats a good idea  were done here  yeah we are definitely done  thank you  thats why i get out of the nidurgangur in the morning  its one of our cheaper beds  there you are  i think your break is over ms wassername  did i make a mistake kenneth  a big mistake  tracy jordan threw milk at you  and you didnt even thank him  how does that reflect on the page program  and our mascot pagey a piece of paper  everyone here is awful  i need to be inspired  i came here to start a glamorous new life  cause today anyone can be famous  i mean look at foxy knoxy  what did she ever do besides not kill anybody  so why not me  i could have a fragrance  or a line of childrens handbags  or be in a reality show with other kooky dumb sluts  you dont think i have dreams  last night i dreamed a baby ate my hair  but sometimes you have to start at the bottom  id like for you to make a delivery for me  and while youre out  think about how your page underwear  has been handed down page to page  for over 70 years   so do you like music  yes  i have supported the baltimore philharmonic for years  these days its just a boom box and a guy in a crab costume  he gets shot out of a cannon at ravens games  the city may not be thriving  well its not just baltimore  we live in a benighted age  the last time i heard classical music on television  was schuberts final sonata in a commercial  now why would anyone use music written by a man  dying of syphilis to sell douches  because people are getting stupider  think how much schubert accomplished  in the 31 years he was alive  coming through  and then theres  this guy  my taxes are paying for your healthcare  do a situp  i really underestimated you jack  maybe we shouldnt talk at all  how do you think our boys are doing in there  i guess its been a pretty rough week  yesterday i ate all the cheese out of the mouse traps  now whod like to continue this magic over drinks  a cosmos five points  okay  all right  hey baby whats wrong  nothings wrong you think somethings wrong with me  whats wrong with you  um

my mouth  happy valentines to the two lovers  come into my restaurant for the romance  no no no were not together  what  but this is a crime  such a beautiful ageappropriate couple  you are perfect
