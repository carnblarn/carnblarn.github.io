through trickery kenneth  we all know deceit is okay if its done for love  like when lots daughters got him drunk  to repopulate the world through incest  or when screech went to the masquerade ball

thanks for the tip  in return heres how youre gonna report it  geiss fights off buyout keeps company intact  makes this gesture  jack i cant do that  because this deal is happening  and if don geiss is fighting it  you should start distancing yourself from him  distancing myself  that man is my mentor  he taught me how to command a room with my voice  back to work  all im saying is the writings on the wall  do you think it was easy for me to cut ties  from my old mentor pat obrien after he shaved his mustache  so this is what you do to people  you use them and then you throw them aside  that is not fair this is not about us  this is about us  i came here asking you to help me  and im trying to help you  being don geiss guy just became a liability  i spent the last 30 years trying to be that guy  well youre never gonna be cause no one is  that world doesnt exist anymore  gasps youre making me sound just like my mother  someone like you couldnt possibly understand  jack im going to connecticut  im gonna stand by my man  which is the song that i sang to don at his promotion dinner  excuse me miss maroney  would you be interested in going to mr jordans show tonight  i know he

happy to go out and get you some weakness tissues  no im not crying in front of jack welch  neutron jack and im not giving up  don geiss wanted this company kept intact  and these people are from philadelphia  let it go john  its over  miss lemon how did the dentists office go  did you meet wesley i did meet him  we even went out for coffee  and  and it was a disaster  we were so awkward that
