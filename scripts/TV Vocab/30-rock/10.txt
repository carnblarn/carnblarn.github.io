novelist he worked at a recycling center  wow  yeah and he just finished writing a sequel  its called urban fervor  boy these titles they really make you think  oh wow  doesnt it seem like just yesterday we were doing the show back in chicago  dreaming about being in the movies  weve come a long way from that apartment we shared in little armenia  oh it was so weird there  you remember that neighborhood festival where they killed a goat in the street  yes  but we did have really good luck that year  yeah  i need to come up with a big idea for a product to put my name on  something no one has thought of something crazy  i know a gentleman who had a lot of crazy ideas  he was a carpenter  he wanted everyone to love one another  oh you mean jesus  no miguel from set design hes over there  eureko  hey  what are you doing back here theyre rehearsing your paris hilton sketch  im trying to avoid jenna she gave me a screener of her movie  and  oh pete its awful i couldnt believe how bad it

jenna  liz same thing ive always done when shes done something terrible  think of one thing nice to say and then hug her  so what did you think  oh my god  you looked so beautiful  the lighting was

delicious food ball  never again will you have to suffer through the bread part of your sandwich  i give you the tracy jordan meat machine  all meat is the new bread uhhuh  what do you think  well its certainly not the worst celebrity product idea ive ever heard  hi im whoopi goldberg  and youre working out with whoopi  with tracy jordan behind this it just might work  well roll it out in time for christmas  manufacture it for four bucks slap your name on it and sell it for 50  so ge will produce the tracy jordan meat machine  oh no no  ge could never make something so um unique  well have to pass this off to one of our subsidiaries  you see ge owns kitchenall of colorado which in turn owns jmi of stanford  which is a majority shareholder in pokerfastlanecom  which recently acquired the sheinhardt wig company  which owns nbc outright  nbc owns winnipeg iron works which owns the ahp chanagi party meats corporation  of pyongyang north korea  and they will make the meat machine  jack

that condescending compliment thing you always do  what when have i ever done that  so what did you think  oh my god you looked beautiful  the lighting was really neat  ethan and i both thought the programs were really easy to read  well thats not how i remember any of that  look liz for once be honest with me  i want your real opinion  okay i thought the story was preposterous  i thought the acting was way over the top  and i thought it was about an hour too long  its only 90 minutes  its kind of a train wreck  a train wreck okay  im not trying to be a jerk here you asked me for my opinion  no no i understand thank you  i wasnt kidding about how cool those trees were though  what were they oaks  damn it where are my car keys  jack tracy what can i do for you  leo we have a product we want you to give a medical endorsement to  ill do it what is it  its called the tracy jordan meat machine  its a dualpress grill  say no more  if its giving people meat then im onboard  ive

hey last night i broke into lizs office  i got jennas movie  oh howd you get in there  that weird security guard tony let me in  i also looked on lizs computer  her last two google searches were for singles yoga and scalp pain  that is grim  the rural juror  man thats disappointing  i had to let tony watch me pee to get that tape  what  hey you wanted to see me  yeah i dont want to wear this paris hilton nose  liz im sorry you have to wear the nose  theres a whole bunch of jokes in the sketch about the nose  well to be perfectly honest i think the entire sketch is a train wreck  oh i see  were not talking about the nose  were talking about the movie  youre wrong about it liz its getting some very positive early reviews  teenmoviescenecom gave it five out of five ipods  jenna believe what you want im your friend im telling you the truth  please  heres whats really going on  its killing you that im in something good that you had nothing to do with  and now youre taking it out on me  oh come on  well enjoy kicking me around for now liz  because i wont be on your crappy little show forever  really  really  really  really  really  really  well jenna im sorry you feel that way  ow what the hell  oh god im sorry  i didnt know there was a person in there  pete could you tell liz lemon not to stand in my eyeline while im rehearsing please  pete could you tell jenna she smells like a stripper  so uh  are you guys still fighting  weve reached kind of an understanding  shes not talking to me  and to retaliate im writing impressions for her that she cant do  i did not have sexual relations with that woman  you guys cant go on like this you have to apologize to her  i didnt do anything wrong  she insisted on me telling her what i thought of her crappy movie  and then she attacked me  liz i cant have the head writer and one of the stars of the show fighting  i can barely keep a lid on the feud going on between kenneth and dougie from props  audience let me ask you a question how many times has this happened to you  or this  seem familiar  bread is one of the worst things in the world  but weve always needed it  until now  by burning three different types of meat together the tracy jordan meat machine  takes bread out of the equation  now your sandwich is all of the good stuff  thats delicious and its healthy  hi im doctor leo spaceman  im a working physician with a degree from the ho chi minh city school of medicine  doctor spaceman is it true that bread eats away at your brain  we have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research  well folks  bread will never maybe attack your brain again  because with the tracy jordan meat machine  say it with me now  all meat is the new bread  where did you guys get this tape  oh josh broke into your office  you went in my office without permission  because im worried about your scalp pain  hello everyone  frank could you tell liz  nope not interested  girl writer could you tell liz that i dont  jenna stop this its stupid  lets just go in my office and talk  oh there is nothing to talk about  stop making this something it isnt  i just didnt like the movie because its bad  these guys watched it theyll tell you  actually we all kind of liked it  what no you didnt  yeah we all did  its not the best thing in the world but its solid and jennas really good in it  thank you frank  look look at her  she cant stand that im in something good  its probably because of her own intellectual insecurities  what frank shut up  fine dismiss me  i guess because i look weird i cant be perceptive  i cant believe you like this movie  oh  jeez i hope those two work it out  relax man  as long as theyre yapping at each other were not working  enjoy it  i want these everywhere  i want every person here eating from a tracy jordan meat machine  ow ah  cheese and crackers that smarts  what happened  the grease burned me mr jordan  the machine must be broken  that one must be defective  oh ow my face my page jacket  they all must be like that wheres donaghy  can somebody take me to a hospital  jenna stop i just want to get past this  what do you need me to do  well you can start by saying youre sorry  to fine  i am sorry that i assumed other people would hate the movie just because i hate it  that was wrong  thats it thats your apology  yeah are we good   were good  great  so do i have to wear the nose tonight  yes you do  okay well then i hope you get bird flu and die  what did you just say to me  you are a big fake you know that liz  she doesnt even need those glasses  really im a fake blondie im a fake  burning jets of grease huh were any of our people hurt   only kenneth  good  what are we gonna do we cant sell this  youre right we cant sell this  in the united states  what  we simply have to find a market with lax safety regulations  with your international appeal we can go anywhere  how about the ukraine  not the ukraine  i own some property on the dnieper river  in volyn  closer to cherkasy  well well find another country then how do you feel about venezuela  cant do it donaghy  i cant put my name on a product thats gonna hurt people  thats disappointing  although i admire your integrity  mr donaghy  they need you on stage immediately  some kind of emergency  for crying out loud  im sorry that were not all weeping with gratitude at getting to read your words  i am so glad i studied voice at northwestern so i could do raps about suri cruise  oh please  if it wasnt for me youd still be slutting it up  for car dealership owners so theyd put you in their commercial  oh so now im a slut yeah  let me tell you something  this slut slept with your brother  mitch  yeah and let me tell you something about mitch  he is disgusting in bed  you know hes not right he was in a really bad skiing accident  ladies  sit down  now what is this about  its about my movie the rrr jrr  theyve adapted the rural juror im a huge kevin grisham fan  jenna has taken the fact that i dont like her movie  and blown it completely out of proportion  she twisted my boob  liz you wanted the movie to be bad you wanted me to fail  okay let me tell you something jenna liz has always supported you  even when i wanted you out of here she wouldnt give in  ive never seen her so worked up  she came at me with that angry little badger face of hers  there it is right now  the point is she went to the mat for you  and she was right   i know but  but nothing  now youre accusing liz of undermining you  they did warn me those diet pills were mood altering  yeah  i think you owe her an apology  oh liz im sorry  no dont be youre right  i did want the movie to be bad  wow  the one time i try to take your side lemon and you sandbag me  im sorry jenna  i smelled crazy in here and i assumed it was you  god liz i mean  i wish you had written my movie too  no its not that its just  the dream that we had in chicago of getting famous  we had it  it was my dream too jenna  yeah but you couldnt have been serious about acting for a living  you have brown hair  look i like what i do now  but theres still this sad little part of me that wants to be the center of attention  that wants to get my hair done and get free clothes  that wants to be you i guess  and your movie just brought all that stuff up again  this is boring im bored now  oh god liz i had no idea  im sorry im a jackass  no im sorry  so you really think im beautiful  i never said that  oh im sorry  tell me in russian feed me whoopi  all whoopi  whats this  i gave the meat machine to whoopi  goldberg or billingham  looks like whoopis made herself another billion grivka  food ball  lets get personal  your father werner was a burger server in suburban santa barbara  yes thats right
