back in  just open the disk part and blow on it  looking for this  you ruined my wedding its payback time  jenna what i did was an accident  but youre trying to sabotage me  just because im getting an award  you know you dont deserve it  without me youd still be  behind that light board in chicago  turning bags of sour patch kids inside out  to lick them clean i got my moneys worth  and without me youd still be doing  local commercials for storebrand douches  well jokes on you because that wasnt a commercial  i dont know what that was  i swear to god you are the most selfish human being   on the planet  thank you  visit my website for extras and ringtones  only because ive let you be it stops tonight  you cant stop me from getting on that stage  are you sure  cause guess what this lighting board nerd did  so what can i do for a fellow lightsmith  i want you to come up 20 on 16 32 and 70   no but that would  just do it  well this stage is now lit for grocery store milk aisle  i cant get up there  ill look horrible  yeah no  did i ruin your wedding again  also you need to tell your aunt mary  when she was two there was an accident  with a hot comb  well she used to be a boy  stop talking mother  save your strength for yelling at doctors  theres a couple of other things i want you to know jack  and i dont want you to interrupt me until im done  all i want is for you to be happy   happy  yes  since when did you ever care about happiness  dont talk to me like that jack  i breastfed you for nine years  those are terrible last words  the closest you ever get to happiness  is when youre criticizing something  preferably something ive done  jack stop talking  i am not going to be around forever   here it comes  one of these days  youre gonna turn around jack  and im gonna be gone just like that  when this little performance is over  i may put you in a home just like that  mother  mother  i cant get it to work  and theres still  so whatever liz lemon  no you dont ruin my thing  i ruin your thing  you are not the center of the universe jenna  i am too im the moon  ladies please today were celebrating women  can it bonnie  i cant believe youre doing this to me  and paul hes been in that steamer trunk for hours  its all right the lack of oxygen is making me orgasm  why cant you ever be happy for me ever  i got married and you dont care  why should she  we shouldnt be defining ourselves by our men  so in order to be independent  we have to be asexual  you would know judy  god i miss gary so much  i put his sweater on a body pillow  i took it for a canoe ride  lightsmith help me out fire up the lekos  and the klieg  dont look at me  dont look at me dont look at me  jack i got your text  but i think there was some autocorrect problems  colleen had a fart attack  she died liz  my god  she had a heart attack and died on the way here  jack i am so sorry  before she died colleen told me   she just wants me to be happy  really  cause that doesnt sound like her  but i guess people do say strange things at the end  you know my grandmother said liz stop playing  with the flesh around my elbow  i just want you to be happy  you know who you say that to a loser  someone who cant hope for anything more in life  than just being happy  you say that to someone who has disappointed you   jack  no its perfect  shes a genius  one last twist of the knife  well thank you for coming lemon but i better get going  the funeral is tomorrow  colleen wanted to be buried  before the rest of the family found out  and sold her body to a haunted house  and of course i get to eulogize colleen at the service  one more chance to disappoint her  as she looks up at me from her throne  in hell  jenna  jenna i mean liz  look lifes too short to be fighting with your best friend  i know can i be real with you liz  all these years ive always been able to look at you  and feel better about myself   sure  dont interrupt  the pill that lets me feel emotion is gonna wear off soon  watching you struggle at work  dating losers wearing boys husky jeans  they have reinforced crutches  now youre winning awards  youre not aging the way i wanted you to  and youre married to a guy that i think about during sex  awwugh  everything feels a little upsidedown  but i am happy for you  and im sorry you werent at my wedding  but it made me realize  that this whole surprise wedding thing is stupid  when i get married i want  everyone i care about to be there  jenna  i feel like you and i havent talked like this  pill wearing off you have mom arms  kenneth its hazel  shes back i recast her  she tested through the roof  at the std clinic  mr jordan stop  i dont want my life to be like tv anymore  because no one learns anything in elevators  and we almost killed florence henderson  yes almost  i dont want my life to be like tv  because my life is way better  where else but real life  would a millionaire movie star  care so much about a hillbilly janitor  that he would spend two days  trying to cheer him up  you cant do that on television  because if you did no one would watch  thank you mr jordan  thank you for my wonderful life  i sure picked the right week to come back  you werent supposed to have any lines kwon lee  now i have to pay you  friends last night when i sat down  to write a speech worthy of my mothers 87 years  i thought i was facing an impossible task  until i realized that her constant crushing disapproval  was a gift  the greatest gift a mother ever gave a son  my lifelong quest to please that woman  is what made me the man i am today  the man who has been the centerfold of fortune magazine  no fewer than three times the man who in 1984  wore a tuxedo so well he broke up the gogos  the man who last night wrote and today will deliver  the greatest eulogy of all time  dublin 1852  a ship bobs in the lee tide  of the icy irish sea  her name ariel  today we are all irish  and the plumber says i dont know  but thats a pretty big pizza  life is for the living  but theres a truth in the center of that  thank you kermit for explaining the afterlife to us  listen jack thank you  for being the man we all aspire to be  ladies and gentlemen  sir paul mccartney and the harlem boys choir  yaaay  and though the falling snow would erase her footprints  it could never erase our memory of her  i love you mother  end of eulogy  wonderful jack wonderful  jenna no dont do this  jenna yes do this  all the people that i care about are here  its perfect  we are so glad that you could come liz  i hope traffic wasnt too bad getting here  surprise im getting married  mother would have hated this  yaaay  and i promise not to make fun of you  when you ask where your glasses are  and they are on your head  i do do that  and i promise to always pour antibiotics  all over your penis  before you staple it to anything  and now paul will read  the vows he has written for jenna  jenna i didnt know what i was missing in my life  until i met you  i love you more than words can say  and i am so honored to be taking your first and last name  ladies and gentlemen  presenting mrs and mr jenna maroneys
