that i cant answer  thisll just be a minute  quietly did you check the lightbulb  please do not use that tone  so much of television is really not fit for children  or christians or the elderly  so what if there was a black bar  on the lower half of your tv screen  that kept you from seeing bad things  like nudity or soccer  congratulations worst so far  liz i never get anything  all i want is

band  id like to start this meeting  by sharing one of my own ideas  and after you hear it maybe we can agree  that employee pitch day is time that could be  better spent drinking and looking out the window  okay jack  youre putting it on the line  what have you got  hank whats the one part of the television experience  thats not perfect  to me its the remote control  too easy to lose right  yes i lose my remote all the time  grr couch cushions chuckles  what if you didnt need a remote control  because your remote control was your own voice  television on channel nbc  a crew out of the bronx

seem to work  you got any other notions  or should we jump to employee ideas  no no no i have another idea  what if uh what if  you had a black bar at the bottom of the screen  that prevented you from seeing anything dirty  i like that  i like that a lot  it would allow parents to eliminate racy content  like soccer or a woman stuffing a turkey  thats a real family company kind of idea jack  and we could sell ads in the black bar  increase our revenue streams  you could call it blabar  aplus work jack  i dont need to hear anything else  if thats the kind of ideas youre bringing nine ten  you will go far son yeah  crap  kenneth we need to talk  earlier today i told hank hooper  about your black bar concept and he loved it  however i presented it as my own idea  wonderful next topic  what
