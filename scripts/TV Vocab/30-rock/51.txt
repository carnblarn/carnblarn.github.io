all of it in a company  that dismantles bank signs theyre doing very well   you dont think hes gonna leave  dont worry  when youre above money personal relationships become your currency  tracy and i have become quite close  look we got bff bracelets  you guys are best friends forever  thats not what that stands for  why would you celebrate that  tell me where you went to school again  well i

valpi  episode 315 the bubble  you went to plunder for lunch how did you get a table  i dont know it was packed but they just gave drew a table  its ridiculous how people treat him the chef sent over food  ladies sent drinks  mayer bloomberg asked him to dance  beautiful people are treated differently from  moderately pleasantlooking people   its true  they live in a bubble  a bubble of free drinks kindness and outdoor sex  how did drew turn out as well as he did going through life like that  the bubble isnt always a bad thing look at me i turned out ok didnt i  i want you to pay close attention  to the following overthetop eye roll  oh brother  i dont share this often  but this is a photo of me when i was 25 years old  what the what  you have a superman chest   i know  oh my god  the lady will have two tickets to the gun show  and your eyes are so much bluer   what happened to your eyes  my point is  the bubble doesnt last forever so get in there with drew and enjoy those perks   while you can  can i keep that  its my only copy  everyone gather around please  actor announcement as you probably know  especially if you read page six of my publicists emails  i have decided to cut my hair and donate it to charity  but why would you cut your beautiful hair  you look just how i picture mary magdalene  because im a selfless person who cant get arrested in this town  meanwhile tracys face is everywhere  i already explained that that was a police sketch of a flasher  who happened to look like tracy we hope   whatever hes hogging the buzz  youve got buzz  you were in that magazine that time  i dont even know what youre referring to  and that was two years ago  as usual i have to create my own opportunities  no one will be talking about tracy jordan this friday  when i cut my hair off on the today show  youre what i think judas looks like  i hope you know how much we value you here  at tgs i like to think of this staff as a family  this is better than a family  no one around here asks me for my damn bone marrow  why dont we make this easy on ourselves  and renew your existing contract  with a 3 increase  sorry it took me so long to answer  i was just thinking about how weird it is that we eat birds  all right we have a deal  you see how easy negotiating can be when its not really about money  hows this really not about money  obviously you dont need to work  whats that now charles  im just saying you made 300 million  last year so theres no financial need  for you to continue with the show but  i never thought of it like that thank you  i quit goodbye  had he really not put that together  tracys is a tactile kinesthetic learning style  so help me god  its nice of those guys to give up their court for us  yes for us  so i should probably warn you i was pro in college  what  i started teaching kids at the y  and then all their mothers wanted to take private lessons from me  but i promise ill take it easy on you  its been a long time since college  what do you mean  excuse me do you give lessons   now what is this  dr drews salmon bourguignon  what is this orangey taste  gatorade  that was awesome  are you choking im a doctor stay calm  i just need to shake it loose  dont panic i just need something to push it down with  do you have a chopstick or a fireplace match or something  there you go  jack there you are   i need to talk to you about something  the tracy deal is a process  we are in process  something happened with drew   hes not a bff  no never  its the bubble  he is a doctor who doesnt know the heimlich maneuver  he cant play tennis he cant cook  hes as bad at sex as i am  but he has no idea  that is the danger of being super handsome  when youre in the bubble nobody tells you the truth  for years i thought i spoke excellent french  drew deserves to be told the truth  hes a good person who is a victim  of our nations obscene cult of superficiality  did you tell him that he was no good in tennis  no i let him win cause i wanted to make out with him in the cab  its not fair to let drew live a lie   and i think im the woman to fix him  be careful  you wake a sleepwalker you risk getting urinated on  or thanked on   mr jordan quit  what  i thought you were in process  tracys taking a strong position right now in the negotiation  its not unheard of for him to stay home while i formulate my counterproposal  what if it doesnt work what if he doesnt come back  when i get upset my accent come out  and when it gets to comin out i cant get to talkin  i have a show on friday  it will be rectified  i didnt mean to upset you  mr donaghy told us not to tell you but i couldnt hold it in anymore  wait a minute are you hiding your screwup from me  dont cling to this  be a manager  control your people buy better clothes  im allowing this because i made a misstep im handling it  and tracy will be here by friday night  just get it done  nope i lost it that was batman  thank you team jenna for being here  obviously my today show charity haircut  is just the first step in my reinvention   this is serial killer language  my mothers boyfriend raised me  to believe that a womans hair is her crowning glory  a haircut can make or break a career  before the rachel jennifer aniston was just a chunky nobody   who couldnt get a job  wasnt she already on friends  richard esposito move to the

stay strong and hell cave  trust me  i hope your right  because youre playing with peoples lives here  dont you think i know that  we are back with sketch comedian jenna maroney  thank you meredith but please im not a hero  just trying to raise awareness  that im more than that hot chick on tracy jordans show   so this is for locks of love  locks of love turned me down  they said my hair was too processed for a sick person to wear  but this is for a wonderful charity called merkins of hope  lets make the big cut  so what about that crazy news that tracy jordan   has quit tgs  what  word is he quit over a contract dispute  guess youre the only star left on that show  stop cutting my hair i dont need this anymore  its ok  its ok i can fix this  is tracy still not here we have 3 hours before the show  security told me that hes in the building so its working  now its all up to kenneth ellen parcell  ive been calling you has cranston not been giving you my messages  he told me  well dont worry  just came to get a few of my things  then i wont bother you  all right i guess thats everything  but i want you to know  if i walk out that door  im not gonna call again  its over  you understand  i cant do this  im sorry but i cant  mr donaghy wanted me to stop talking to you so youd come back  so you used cranston as his gatekeeper  im very disappointed  i know i blew it  i guess im only farm strong and not heart strong  fine go and help him i shouldnt have tried to  manipulate the two of you that way  but i will need you to turn in your page jacket  what  your main duty was taking care of tracy  he no longer works here  therefore your services are no longer required  as a page  wait a minute you want to fire my boy ken  stay out of this its not your concern   unless  unless what  you said kenneth cant work here because i dont work here  but if i work here so can kenneth   i dont understand  of course you dont you idiot  im coming back to work  with kenneth  damn you and your meddling  ill be in my dressing room  atta boy come on  ive gotta get back into that bubble  sir you are pulling that look off  i wanted to apologize for my behavior the other day on the tennis court  that is not who i am   but you made me feel like a loser  cause you lost  maybe i shouldnt have done that to you but  you have so much potential  but im happy this way  i didnt like it
