with exploration  and i know exactly what any  practice frottage on a poster of linda ronstadt  and meet your idol  like when i met jacques cousteau  i will never forget what he said to me  oh i did forget  it was so long ago  when i was a kid i got to meet  the wheres the beef lady  with my connections i can make kaylies dreams come true  i should dig up my old shell collection and give it to her  complete the seduction after bob ballard and i  doubleteam her  word choice jack  withdrawn  lemon is that the new woman you hired  is it cold in here or is it just that  im not wearing any

favorite fish as a boy  look at those teeth  you know thats a female  the male is much smaller and is basically a parasite  that lives on her  until mating of course then the male dies  yes the scientific term for that is marriage  chuckles  dont tell gina i said that  the ocean really is the final frontier kaylie  and we keep finding new things  giant tube worms that breathe hydrogen sulfide  arctic jellyfish oh  and a chemical in kelp that scientists think  might one day cure ice cream headaches  theres so much left to discover  and you could be the one to do it  i kind of envy you  youngsters are the future of ocean exploration kaylie  i mean im not gonna live forever  no matter how much gold i give poseidon  thats why im making you a student argonaut  gasps  i cant believe this is happening  shrieks  you already speak dolphin  excellent  is there an age cutoff for the student argonauts  what if you gave me a sticker as a joke  chuckles  you know mr donaghy it  it seems

meeting me here  this place is very special to me  is this where you got your vcard punched  what no  does this look like the makeup room of a clown academy  no this is a statue  and i know you know this of eleanor roosevelt  first lady to the world  champion of the rights of women  and the lid on my high school lunch box  look i know it can be hard  society puts a lot of pressure on us  to act a certain way  but tgs is a safe place  so you can drop the sexy baby act  and lose the pigtails  but i like my pigtails  my uncle says theyre sexy  enough with the gross jokes  and that voice  i want you to talk in your real voice  this is my real voice  and the whole sexy baby thing isnt an act  im a very sexy baby  i cant help it if men are attracted to me  like that homeless guy  he likes what he sees  okay that could be for me  its not its for her   abby im trying to help you  really  by judging me on my appearance and the way i talk  and whats the difference between me  using my sexuality and you using those glasses to look smart  scoffs i am smart  i placed out of freshman german  or lutz using that sexy english accent  to get me in the sack  no you didnt lutz  is that even possible  i mean i was there when he belvedered  god abby you cant be that desperate for male attention  you know what liz  i dont have to explain myself to you  my life is none of your business  except it is because you represent my show  and you represent my gender in this business  and you embarrass me  kiss  dude i am sorry but this is who i am  deal with it  now are we gonna give the gentleman  what he asked for or not  ugh  kenneth when im gone  how do you think people will remember me  actually sir ive already started to compose  a heroic ballad commemorating your life  slaves of jesus   hear my tale   ill tell you what theyll say  hey remember jack donaghy  he wore a lot of suits and went to a lot of meetings  now power down conversation robot  sounds like youre asking some pretty big questions  when i have problems i like to talk  to the man upstairs  unfortunately mr guzelian got put in jail  for attacking his father  i mean what are we put on this earth to do  sit behind a desk  im still young kenneth  i could devote the time i have left to other interests  let kaylie run kabletown  ill join ballards group and become  a scientistadventurer  now that chuckles  would be a legacy  i hope my legacy is a sesame street type tv show  that promotes illiteracy in girls  this could be me  remember jack donaghy  he was the worlds greatest oceanographer  and we walruses owe him everything  for giving us the gift of language  no  all right your time is up my friend  im taking control of this abby situation  no jenna im not done  check this out  im thinking to myself whatever happened  to the erasable pen  besides pencils whos saying thats a bad idea  ive always thought that  but i never had the courage to say it  is that abby  i knew her boobs were fake  and that baby voice is fake too  you know as someone who speaks very naturally  im offended  shes taken on a whole new identity  she changed her nose her teeth  she even changed her name  its not abby flynn its abby grossman  well thats understandable  i mean grossman is a little bagely  abby used to be a strong smart beautiful woman  why did she transform herself into that baby hooker  quietly oh  childrens book idea baby hooker  dont tell liz  well i am confronting abby with this  in front of everybody  oh thats vicious  forget my idea yours is so elegant  no jenna for the last time  were helping her

edwin  this is charles im on for douglas  no charles im on but i just dialed in  gasps  chuckles  mr donaghy  what are you doing here  i could ask you the same thing  but that would make no sense  chuckles  where did you get this picture of cousteau  that  the internet  this picture exists in only two places  the negative is in my personal safe  along with my will and some beanie babies  that i thought would be worth more  or it could be found in the right book  ugh  hey what are you doing  quiet chalkhands  a real man is talking  why do you have this kaylie  why are you reading my autobiography  well uh  same reason youre reading poppops book  researching the enemy  so its true  i was trying to make you think you didnt want  to run kabletown while you were doing the same thing to me  what a super sleuth gasps  youre just like vanessa from  the vampire detective mysteries  im not familiar with that reference  but i assume that vanessa is some kind of cool genius  you dont even like the ocean do you  i hate the ocean its for tools  the oceans awesome and for winners  youre for tools  you cant beat me mr donaghy  you worked your way into this world  but i i was born into it  i breathe it inhales  so watch your step  childlike voice cause i can always tell poppop  you gave me alcohol  and i can always seduce one of your teachers  and get her to fail you   id be into that  me too  bell rings  better pick up your books or youll be late for class  this is my free period  well played  megan books  sighs  you know what sucked about my last lesbian orgy  right in the

i changed my appearance to get away from him  oh cause i thought it was like  pressure from society  youre right liz  i was hiding from a man  who went insane after being electrocuted  while watching sleeping with the enemy  i was cut out of that  oh yeah i am desperate for male attention  because i feel safer having men around  in case troy comes back  that is why i slept with lutz  and i shall protect her  is there an abby flynn here  thats her troy  im on your side get her  geez lutz its the ups guy  okay i think we all owe abby an apology  oh my god its from him  i thought this box would

nice  wrapup scene between jack and liz  after all they spent the whole episode  trying to help young women  but first i would like to correct  some of the science we saw tonight  there is no oil in kelp that helps cure ice cream headaches  no the only thing that will cure ice cream headaches  is having sex on a motorcycle  kailey was not speaking dolphin  when a dolphin expresses excitement  it sounds like this  making weird noises  okay we got a lot of fun tonight and its not over  in the time remaining were gonna go to that jack and liz wrap up scene i promised you  well lemon
