wouldnt know im not a math guy really  this is only a setback  i just have to create a market for terrible couches  besides what did theodore bazooka joe do  when his eccentric millionaire father  left him nothing but a tiny pink rock quarry  he baked those rocks and sold them to children  as gum  tracy i need your input  i cannot give it to you im a married man  but more importantly  i find you very unattractive  no i need your advice  im having a celebrity breakdown  ive been there jmo  whats the matter  partying too hard with christian slater  furious about nafta y2k panic  my heyday

cd and a ham sandwich  dudely lets make coffee our bitch  when did we get so soft  you know what this country used to sit on  logs  girders  poles  being comfortable  thats not what americas all about

come  my whole body is asleep oh  thats a bad couch jack  it is unfortunate  the design forces the sitter  into what israeli military interrogators call  a stress position  oh  it cuts off circulation to the legs  while simultaneously spreading out the ribcage  making it difficult to breathe  while the body begs for oxygenated blood  it comes in espresso dandelion  putty and as you see here lagoon  so youre gonna just try to sell discomfort  i dont have a choice  if i blow this  hank hooper will never give me another shot  ill spend the rest of my career behind this desk  trying to lure alf back to television  okay jack  well im gonna go meet your buddy kevin now  yes he mentioned you were getting together  and you certainly are dressed to impress  you look like a substitute teacher  who just got her oneyear aa chip  well im just doing this as a formality jack  lemon i know you dont trust me  but keep an open mind  ill do my best but i watched like  thrmythbusters last night  so im pretty

catherine but everyone calls me cat  although im trying to get people at school  to call me scout like in to kill a mockingbird  i love that book  i had my first crush on a shop teacher  who looked just like boo radley  yeah scouts not getting much traction though  well its hard to force a nickname  i tried to get my high school tennis team  to call me ace  but they wanted to call me shorts accident  so we settled on supervirgin  okay so i might not get scout  but i can negotiate up from puked in thermos  well then let me ask you this  would jeremy lin be willing  to videotape a message for my buddys bachelor party  ugh  sorry shes with me  its take your daughter to work day  and kabletowns really into all this family shiz  so what have you learned today  that people who talk the most in meetings  often know the least  she sat in two meetings with me  i crushed it  so whats your deal you ski  i dont you know if im gonna fall down a hill and die  i want to do it for free  brian what is up slick  do you think i could pull off a haircut  like scout had in the movie  ive been there cat  and you should know  that people are gonna assume that youre  im a lesbian i know  i just needed to hear it  so what do you want to be when you grow up  either the wicked queen indisney on ice  or the third woman president  well played i am giving you gum for that  where is he where is kev  its game go  what are you doing what  game go is not a phrase i dont know  i just got really wound up at the thought  of you getting checked out by some creep  and hes in trouble too  cause i watched some boxercise videos  on demand before coming down here  hi im criss  this is cat this is kevins daughter  shes awesome unlike kevin  who is wearing a rope bracelet  and i did not give it to him  people assume i gave it to him  but im like youre not pinning that on me  i cant believe you really came down here  to try to fight my date  that hasnt happened to me since senior prom  when rob sussman tried to fight richard sallatto  because they had secretly broken up with each other  the night before  why are you so out of breath  cause i ran all the way down here  why didnt you just take the subway  cause thats not romantic watch a movie liz  i wish my boyfriend did stuff like this  but i feel the passion is gone  since he left for college  im totally messing with you  guys im 11  oh thank god  that is not funny young lady  its a little funny  im sorry jmo  i called the front desk  but theres no one else down there  paul didnt come  i guess i faked this stupid breakdown for nothing  jenna ive been thinking  why youre famous  i know but i dont think  you were faking anything here  maroney you jumped through a window  you made out with paz de la huerta  at a childrens museum  you tried to dine at balthazar  without a reservation  and you did all that to get some guys attention  thats crazy thats a breakdown  i think ive made the biggest mistake of my life  ive never made a mistake  so i dont totally understand  but im here for you j  of all the crazy things i did  you know what the craziest was  letting paul go  i was scared to be happy now i never will be  ill take this regret to my grave  you mean our grave  where well lie on top of each other  in one coffin  pelvis to face for eternity  you were here the whole time  taking care of me  i was afraid too jenna  i had to be sure that you wanted  the same thing that i did  and now i know  you sick bitch  tracy if youll excuse us  no paul  if it wasnt for tracy we wouldnt be here right now  he can stay  no im cool im gonna leave   lemon how did your date go  it was amazing  but not in the way that you would expect  cats a great kid isnt she  you really thought id set you up with kevin  ive been trying to fire him ever since he invited me out  on a halloween party bus  but his daughters terrific  so you set me up on a play date  i thought kat would remind you why  you purchased the princess leia costume  in the first place  dont give it away just yet  thats very nice of you jack  but you need to learn that some women  choose to be childless and are content with that  this is not a choice  oh you are being so transvaginal right now  the past few days have only confirmed my fear  that were running out of good americans  so honestly your country needs  a few more liz lemons  oh okay  so this has nothing to do with criss  i dont care how you do it  i dont care if you join the big sisters  and torture innercity girls about punctuation  any amount of lemon is better than the crap  were turning out lately  exsqueeze me mr d  couches are ready to ship  in trucks  ship in trucks what  wait you sold them to whom  i just had to find a buyer who has too much money  and loves to waste it  so every defective sofa that kouchtown makes  will be purchased by your beloved  taxandspend government  what are they going to do with them  sink them and make a reef  to protect gay turtles  i dont know lemon and i dont care  mr wang we know you were spying  for north korean intelligence  give me something i can take back to langley  then well get you out of the couch  and send you home with a cia gift bag  i totally blew off that week of korean we did  lets get the translator   i think maybe i still  i dont think you should   want to be a mom  give up on having a kid  okay were on the same page  i think weve talked about it enough  maybe we just put a pin in that  and have some fun  ill open a puzzle  ill make a stew  life is happening  when did gum get so soft you sons of bitches  you know what this country used to chew  tree bark  glass shotgun shells  the broken swords of our vanquished enemies  thats why i buy bazooka joe gum  its like chewing a mountain  that someone shot a freeze ray into  whats wrong with this country huh  when did we lose our way  detroit  life is hard  shouldnt everything else be harder  bazooka joe gum
