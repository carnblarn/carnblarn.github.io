you without a dream content with this meaningless pitiful job  do you know why i put up with this pitiful job mr donaghy  why i fetch these folks lunches and clean up their barfs  because they make television  and more than jazz or musical theater or morbid obesity television is the true american art form  think of all the shared experiences television has provided for us  from the moon landing to the golden girls finale  from walter cronkite denouncing vietnam to oprah pulling that trash bag of fat out in a wagon  from the glory and the pageantry of the summer olympics  to the less fun winter olympics  so please dont tell me i dont have a dream sir  i am living my dream  oh my  how did he get that up there  i wish i shared your passion for television kenneth  which show would you rather watch  an exporn star who talks to ghosts or a remake of little house on the prairie  neither  i want to see a show where women get their hair done  while listening to salsa music  i also have an idea for a cop show  called k9 exclamation point  oh and a game show called gold case  its a cross between deal or no deal and millionaire with a charming celebrity host to be determined  go on
