everyones rewrites by yourself  thats not right  yes but at least i know that nobody hates me today  you think jack donagee sits up there and worries if people are saying bad things about him  its different for women  i dont think it is  sometimes people hate their bosses  big deal  but you gotta stick up for yourself  because if you dont theyll take advantage of you  oh hey could i borrow 60 bucks  im going to meet frank and lutz at scores  so i founded the don geiss diabetes research foundation  which is why youre all here tonight  gwen and i really hope youll be as generous with your checkbooks  as you were on the links today with your scorekeeping  thank you  whats he doing  excuse me  i know i wasnt asked to say anything but i would like to share my experience with you  when my daughter shahita was born  she had chubby arms and legs and a big bald head  she looked like my uncle rupert in a diaper  by the time she was five she was 87 pounds  i mean she could eat  but then when was around eight years old  i remember it was easter  we stayed up all night the night before watching bible movies and eating fiddle faddle  i remember the next day easter sunday  she threw up right in the middle of the jaguar dealership  she was mad sick  and i carried her all the way to st lukes roosevelt  the doctor said she had diabetes  i get very upset because i think i was the cause  of that due to my ignorance of nutrition  and i promised sha that night  that i was gonna dedicate all my efforts to raise awareness  and finding a cure  and i just hope that all of you will join me  thank you  unbelievable  record donations  i cant thank you enough  jack im gonna be on the vineyard next month  i want you and tracy to come up and well talk about  getting you back in the movie business  ill set that up sir  okay  tracy bring your daughter  thats a deal  thanks again  congratulations tracy  and welcome to the grown up world  yeah  i dont have a daughter  lets have a casting

needs her sweater  ow  yes sir  youre watching the designing women marathon on nick at nite  sir you may be right  i may be not capable of understanding normal thinking  because i think a woman is just as powerful as a man  and until you learn to respect me  you better learn to stay out of my way  cause this is my house  this is my house  staying up all night rewriting the amazing hobo  you fat nerd  good morning lemon  hey jack come on  you stay up all night  how can you tell  this is the mens room  oh  did you win your golf parade  even better  next weekend tracy and i are gonna double
