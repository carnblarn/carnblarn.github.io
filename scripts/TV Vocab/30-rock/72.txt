first thing he ever said to me  these are all hookers pick one  then after we picked our hookers and the plane took off  he told me his business philosophy  theres always an untapped market  don was the one who realized there was a whole segment  of consumers not buying light bulbs  the asleep  that realization led him to develop the nightlight  and the marketing campaign aimed at making children  afraid of the dark a monster under every bed  don said that no business is ever done evolving  but there are always opportunities for innovation  that you can always  you can always find new customers  im sorry  but i just had an amazing business idea  youll have to excuse me  applause  ave maria    i know its not my place yet to call a meeting  of kabletown senior vice presidents  but i have something i need to share with you  gentlemen there is a giant segment of consumers  who are not buying our most lucrative product  three words porn for women  jack women hate porn  almost as much as men hate going to outlet malls  yes women hate porn our porn  but women do have one insatiable need  to jabber  and it doesnt matter if you have a headache  or youre not in the mood  or youre about to go to don geisss funeral  they barge right into your office  and start complaining about a boyfriend  or a coworker  and youre supposed to sit there and nod  and tell them theyre right  and the more you give it to them the more they want it  ill tell you sometimes my wife will be blathering on  about something and ill think  im more than just a pair of ears  you know im a person  who thinks about sex every seven seconds  exactly  so what if women had a payperview channel  featuring handsome men patiently listening to them  what if they had porn for women  okay but where does that content come from  from us we make it  jack we dont make  hear me out yes im talking about  doubling payperview profits  while cutting out the middle man but im also talking  about american
