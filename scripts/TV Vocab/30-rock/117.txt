familiar with the shower principle  i remember mrs doyle  pulling me aside to talk about it   in the seventh grade  uh no  the shower principle is a term scientists use  to describe moments of inspiration that occur  when the brain is distracted from the problem at hand  for example when youre showering  i was in the shower when i finally got the title  of the movie face off  face off face off  exactly  if the cerebral cortex is distracted  by showering or putting  then another part of the brain  the anterior superior temporal gyrus is activated  this is the site of sudden cognitive inspiration  coughs nerd alert nerd alert  coughing  the problem at hand is this man  my boss hank hooper  kabletown has grown a lot  over the years but its still a family company  with a very simple goal  to entertain folks  thats all people want  to sit on their sofas  oh why am i putting on airs  to sit on their couches  and hear stories heres one   we were on patrol somewhere near the cambodian border  uh we can skip this part  so we boiled the skull  and made a tea kettle out of it  laughs  my point is i believe that slow and steady wins the race  we dont take risks we make profits  so now lets get this dog fashion show started  everyone hide your bones  dogbeard the pirate just sailed into woof harbor  ugh  you know what else hank announced at that meeting  record profits  really can we start getting real soda  because i think corkacoola brand diet banana lime   causes tum nungnuss  no  and do you know what hank wants to do with that money  pay a shareholder dividend  meanwhile the kabletown blimp is in such disrepair  we got a jeers in corporate blimps weekly  i want to use that money to transform this company  but first i have to convince hank hooper  a white man who still buys cadillacs  i just need the right idea  do you think a year ago today  we were having this same conversation  because it sure feels like it  probably  and knowing you as you
