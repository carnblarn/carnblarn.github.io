                hey jack   did you dye your hair  no  no  so how was your new years  wonderful my dear friend  the deepsea explorer bob ballard  brought over a 2000yearold amphora of wine  from a sunken phoenician trading vessel  the wine turned out to be quite toxic  my guests and i spent the stroke of midnight  in my garden vomiting   oh my god sorry  dont be  the whole night the purging the new year  the vivid hallucinations of astarte  the phoenician goddess of sex and war  it all wiped the slate clean  so nancy donovan  what happened before christmas was a mistake  she hasnt contacted me since so clearly she agrees its over  well thats healthy a clean break  exactly a clean break  so what about you lemon  is your 2010 off to a good start  well i spent new years eve with my family  which was actually very special  my cousin randy  this kid from this rural coal mining town  came out to us  and i think old liz lemon had a little something  to do with that  randys gay everybody hes gay  i think everyone knew  finally  over the break i forgot what floor i worked on  six tracy  six i knew it was a character from blossom  but i couldnt find the joey russo button  hold the door  you guys i had the most amazing new years  i met james francos manager it was like a fairy tale  my client james franco hes actively looking  for a relationship with a human woman  to dispel certain unsavory rumors  are you available for a fake romance with a movie star  does chewing on a sponge trick your brains hunger center  yes yes a million times yes  so this is some arranged hollywood relationship  with james franco  can you believe they went to me  before ayilla from the real world cancun  i think its great  the exposure will do wonders for you and tgs  lemon i want you and jenna to have a meeting  with james franco and make sure his manager doesnt screw her  too late  wait which way did you mean that  i had a pretty amazing new years too  my wife and i are trying for a daughter  and on new years eve i think i got angie pregnant  no no no no  okay but i was gonna describe it real good   how was your new years sir  perfect  oh my god  as you know on new years  i finally met my birth parents  so thank you for asking about that   i called her lemon  what  i called nancy on new years eve at 342 am  damn that phoenician wine  and you dont remember doing it  the last thing i remember is going into a closet  and switching clothes with bob ballard  look i dont think you actually spoke to her  you hit pound after the number  i think you left a message  cerie get on her youface page   lemon do you mind  no  one second okay  okay her youface page says theyre on vacation  theyre borrowing a friends condo in florida  oh what have i done  the woman is on vacation with her husband as we speak  probably having beach sex which is the third best sex  after elevator and white house  is there any chance that she hasnt heard it yet  as a frequent leaver of drunken messages  i can tell you no good can come of this  as a frequent receiver of drunk messages  they are not cute even when theyre from liz  da da da  good lord  ive lemoned the situation with nancy  ive got to erase that message  lemoned thats not a thing  people are saying now is it  cerie  lemoned  doing it awesome  heres the general idea jenna  you and i pretend that we met while filming a movie  called space attack  my title  this movie will never be released  because my performance will be deemed  too provocative for america  oh i wish i lived in france  but out of this experience  we found each other et cetera et cetera  five dates a week one fight a month  and because of a product placement deal with jamba juice  the fight will be in a jamba juice  i love jamba juice  and this is the nondisclosure agreement  regarding anything you two may learn about each other  during the course of the relationship  yeah what exactly is mr franco covering up here  i liz are you familiar with japanese moe relationships  where socially dysfunctional men develop  deep emotional attachments to body pillows  with women painted on them  i am not james  neither am i liz  which is why its so weird  the tabloids are running all these stories  saying im in love with a body pillow  i mean its crazy  then why is that here  why  i mean why is this table here  i mean why is that lamp here  kimiko is  it is here like any other object  objects are made by men and used for many purposes  but we never love objects  where do i sign  hello  liz its randy randy lemon  oh hey randy whats up
