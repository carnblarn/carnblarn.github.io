square  well the theme restaurant business model does work  nascars fat load cafe is a gold mine  well we got a bunch of capital  from brown and folderson  and we wanted to get you a seat on this rocket  before it takes off  so its decided jacks on board as an investor  ah not so fast  soitsdecid  uh lets just bottomline this thing  i never invest without doing my research  ill do a site visit

taliban rule  but after your shift  we still have our special night right  you have no idea how special  ugh  oh were celebrating our sixmonth anniversary  and i think paul is going to pop the question  really thats a little fast isnt it  i will say yes when paul proposes  that we make a sex tape and leak it on the internet  oh i thought you meant marriage  god no marriage is like death  you settle into a routine you lose all the spark  i dont know  i always thought the whole point  of being with someone for a long time  is to get to the comfortable routine part  no relationships are like sharks liz  if youre not left with several bite marks  after intercourse then somethings wrong  well nothings wrong with me and carol  i mean we havent spoken in five days  but that doesnt mean anything because we are not sharks  we are legless turtles rotting on the beach  jack what makes a guy get bored in a dating situation  thats an excellent question  the answer is questions like that  look this long distance is hard  and now carol and i havent talked  in like five days  and my other stuff is still unresolved  i get it lemon you need to see a therapist  someone you can dump your problems on  and then get on with your uh life  ugh im trying i just cant find someone i like  i mean have you ever been to a shrink  no i believe that when you have a problem  you talk it over with your priest  or your tailor or the mute elevator porter  at your mens club  then you take that problem and crush it  with your mind vice  but for lesser beings like curlyhaired men  and people who need glasses  therapy can help  and lemon i want you to get better  because and i mean this  im tired of talking this much to a woman  im not having sex with  hey jack welcome to staples  why did you choose that name  because staples means the basics  and thats what youre getting here  food drinks fun staples yeah we got that  staples is also a giant office supply chain  well well see whos still in business 200 years from now  come on  donald im going to pick a problem at random  is the theme of your restaurant not enough tables  no we just need a lot of room  for the monster fight  excuse me  jack are you familiar  with the megarestaurant medieval times  well i took that model and replaced the knights  with unlicensed versions of japanese monsters  ladies and gentlemen  theres been an underwater nuclear explosion  a beast has been awakened  it approaches with fearsome steps  boom boom boom  are we paying the price for our hubris of science  witness the primeval might that is godzila with one l  for trademark reasons  oh no one is safe  who all is going to protect us  its mechagodzila  boom boom boom  thank you for choosing staples  ah donald george punched my crotch  you liked it  oh my god  knocks at door captain burnett  called earlier miss lemon  finally not that it matters  were turtles  he said he doesnt have cell phone service  cause hes on layover in daytona beach  but dont worry hes fine and having a great time  with his flight crew  uh stewart brenda amber crystal  also in the background i heard lady giggles  and the sound of a beautiful sunset  see this is why i need to find someone to talk to   talk to about what  men trust  i mean i just feel like sometimes men  arent totally honest with me  hmm go on  well for starters  everyone i ever dated in high school  turned out to be either gay  or a girl dressed as a guy  to get a journalism scholarship  my own dad tried to secretly cheat on my mom  and i thought their marriage was perfect  then of course theres santa claus  okay talk about that  when i was seven  i asked for a cb radio for christmas  so i could track gas prices around the state  for a cool chart that i was making  well get back to that later  when i didnt get it  my dad blamed santa claus  well santa made an enemy that day  and the next year when he returned  to the schuylkill galleria so did vengeance  ho ho ho what can santa bring you this year  what does it matter  you didnt bring me what i asked for last year  you fat fraud  youre a bigger disappointment than our current president  jimmy carter  i am a fraud little boy  gasps  my wife still thinks i work at the bank  i guess santa claus was the first man  to ever betray me  that mustve been difficult  it was  but it feels good to talk about it  thanks  miss lemon  theres a reason god gave us two ears  and only one mouth  listening is twice as important as talking  but he gave us ten fingers  he must really want us to poke things   oh  poke poke poke poke  exhales  oh its the vacant lot  where we had our first face kiss  who stole my canteen  jenna what we have is so beautiful  people need to see how happy we make each other  and i think were ready to take that step  so over christmas i want you to come to ohio  and meet my parents   what  happy anniversary  hey get a room whatever that is  well tracy i went to the restaurant last night

other investors besides me  what youre the only one bankrolling this  what about brown and folderson  thats what i call my wallet  ive bankrolled every one of donalds dumb ideas  but what choice do i have im his father  but youre doing him no favors  as a business partner or a father  you need to cut him off  come on the boys only 43 years old  tracy listen to me  not everyone is cut out to be a businessman  for example curlyhaired men and people who need glasses  but i cant crush his dreams  youre not youre just letting him fly  with his own wings  i bankrolled that too  thank god we tested it with a monkey first  oh miss lemon im signing people up  for the tgs softball team  so far i have eight nos  and 25 shove it up your goonholes   shove it up your goonhole  okay  you know ever since we had our little talk yesterday  ive been doing some thinking  oh good  if i remember correctly  we were discussing men and trust  yeah and it got me thinking about my aunt linda   what was she like  great until she got divorced  my uncle harry was cheating on her  another male betrayal go with that  my parents used to make me go to lindas house  just so shed have company  i hated those visits  your uncle never liked my cooking  but you do right elizabeth  you love your aunt linda  heres a fun game  put on harrys cologne  and give me a backrub in the bath  laughs  cries  to this day whenever i hear someones getting divorced  i can still taste that egg and i  oh my god  my trust issues and my food issues  are connected  uncle harold is the reason  eggs make me gag  kenneth youre the perfect therapist  i can dump all of my problems on you  walk away and move on with my life  its a winwin  why did she have to say harold  liz  last night was a disaster  and not the good kind  where i get to sing at a benefit  what happened  pauls idea of moving things forward  is me meeting his parents  he said they live in a sooborb  suburb come on jenna  its not what you wanted but its progress  in the wrong direction  i think i know whats really going on  between you and paul  youre in love  and its terrifying to you  youre trying to sabotage it  sabotage  im the one trying to make this relationship work  which is why im gonna have to be the one  to propose the sex tape  call me oldfashioned  but i think thats the mans job  jack i found a therapist and ive made  some big breakthroughs  i know you dont know what this means  but im eating eggs again  i know it means this conversation is disgusting  laughs  okay donald is on his way up  i know cutting him off is hard  but its your duty as a parent  laughs  tracy do not laugh at the word duty  be strong be rational inhales no emotion   unemotional got it  daddy whats going on  crying i just love you so much  i love you too daddy  both bawling  okay stop it  donald what tracy is trying to tell you  is that youre an adult  and he will no longer support you financially  is that true daddy  for the love of god stop calling him daddy  it is true little man  but i need you to be a big boy on this  youre just not meant to be a businessman  fine ill be okay  i got other ideas  like a microbrewery that also serves frozen yogurt  im gonna call it microsoft  i have this recurring dream  actually is it recurring if you wake yourself up  with a snorts and then return to it  anyway in the dream im a baby  voice echoing  i think it has to do with my issues with sex  lemon what are you doing is kenneth your therapist   well kind of  he cant handle that  look at his head shape he has no brain pan  its fine mr donaghy im okay  highpitched voice and so am i im cheryl  this is exactly why i told you to see a professional  you dump your problems on some halfbaked barney fife  and you can start a chain reaction  of mental anguish  look what youve done to him  but hes such a good listener and he takes my insurance  im going to help you lie down  put your mental burden in my mind vice  and i will crush it  kenneth who is harold  hewas a role model of mine growing up  whispers please let harold be human  harold was a pig  you see my father passed when i was just a young boy  after that i was alone a lot and awful sad  but that pig saved me  in some ways  harold was the only thing i had  that was like a father  you had a void to fill  continue  then one day  my mama told me we had to sell him  i knew what that meant  harold was off to the slaughterhouse   i know its difficult  im not done sir  it gets worse  with harold gone  there was nothing keeping me at home  it was time for me to move to new york  and follow my dreams  but i needed 300  for the river ferry trainox carttrainbus ticket  and thats when i saw the sign  i knew i could win that contest  heck id once eaten an entire witch  a pig was nothing  and then they brought me mine  i would have recognized those eyes anywhere   kenneth no  it was harold  and i ate all of him even the face in case of a tie   good god  i ate him sir  i ate my father pig  whimpers and squeals  okay or you gave his death meaning  his sacrifice made you what you are today  which is the lowestlevel employee  at the lastplace network in america  i guess that is true thank you sir  ill think on that  and youre sure youre okay hearing about all my problems  of course im jack donaghy  exhales  oh no crush it  oh god here comes my childhood  cries  im in here paul  the restaurant was crazy today  during nude hour i got custard  all over my penis  whats going on in here  you want to take this to the next level  lets videotape our lovemaking  pretend the tape got stolen and let the whole world see  wow i dont know jenna   im pretty beat  i see  fine i guess were just done having any adventure  or excitement in our lives  god well jeez im sorry that im happy  with the way things are  come on why cant we just paint each others toenails  watch vintage pornography  and then go to bed in our swing like a normal couple  because its boring  we might as well be married  okay this isnt about us being adventurous  this is about you being afraid to settle down with me   thats not true  fine lets do this tape  but then what what will you want next  well theres a sex resort in japan  where white people are treated like slaves  no jenna  youre making it impossible  to live up to your expectations  what are you saying  im saying adopting a dog  so it can watch us make love  and then returning it claiming that it bit  our imaginary child is everything that i need  but if thats really not enough for you  tell me now   im sorry  very well  im not going to beg you i have my dignity  i trust you to fairly divide up our panties  ill come get them tomorrow while youre at work  oh miss lemon i have another message  from captain burnett  please dont get sad and remember things  and infect me again  kenneth its okay  im not worried about carol anymore  im just sorry i messed you up like that  dont worry i had my brain cleaned by mr donaghy  oh i told him everything how harold was  no no dont tell me your story  i cant handle it look how small my head is  oh my so tiny  daddy i wanted to give you your share of our profits  before i shut down my dream  someone left it in coat check  tracy listen to me i was wrong  dont turn your back on donald  too late look how were positioned  kenneth told me a story earlier  a story about fathers and sons  and despite my best effort  it unearthed a memory from my own childhood  as a boy i wanted to be an astronaut  or a deepsea diver a man of science  but i was raised by jimmy donaghy  a man who projected his own failed dreams  on to his family  when i was in third grade  my class put on a science play  the night before jimmy came home drunk  and found me rehearsing my lines  i was struggling with the science terms  and jimmy laughed and said well looky here  dr jack the boy wants to be a scientist  chowderhead cant even say the words  youll never be nothing  the next day i was up on that stage  i looked out at the audience i saw jimmy and i froze  i am a protoin protein  all living orgasms i mean orgasms  chowderhead cant even say the words  when i got home i threw away my microscope  my shell collection my map of the stars  coughs nerd  a parent is the one person who is supposed  to make their kid think they can do anything  says theyre beautiful even when theyre ugly  thinks theyre smart even when they go to arizona state  let the rest of the world tear your kid down  your job is to support him no matter what  tracy believes you donald go and make him proud  thats a nice long speech and all  but your daddy was right  you couldnt be a scientist  you could even be protein in a school play  and i cant run a business im a failure  i  am a protein  all living organisms need me to function  a basic building block of the human body  im made from amino acids found in ribosomes  proteins give energy to everything  from flowers and butterflies  to heroes who turn in communists  i am a protein  daddy can i have 50000 to start a business  where people can call in and get air quality reports  from all across the united states   im gonna call it  donald no
