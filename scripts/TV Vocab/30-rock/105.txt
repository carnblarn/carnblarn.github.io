to rearrange my bathroom   for the better  yes  the basket of shells was a nice touch  but im afraid i have bad news  i just told criss that i am officially disapproving   oh no  who cares  of course youre free to make your own decisions lemon  you can either pretend that you and i are not in agreement  and continue this uh  charade  or you can part ways with criss now  and go and find someone who will truly make you happy  im sorry is this guy breaking up with me  of course you and criss can still be friends  okay liz i guess you got a choice to make  you can listen to jack we can call it quits  and i go back to sleeping on the floor  of my uncles mattress store or  you dont understand  hes in my head  okay forget jack  what does liz think hmm  what do you want  do you want to be with
