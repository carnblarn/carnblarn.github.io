our genders   yes it does  the older you get the more distinguished you are  meanwhile im reading a book called  hiding your arms hiding your anger  dating over 35   lemon i am successful romantically

come on trey no one here is racist   oh yeah how come im always forced to play  ridicarus characters that dont enununciate well   uh   so what look at italians  were always portrayed either as goombahs or guidos  but we dont care because were successful members of society  so maybe your problem is that youre finally being treated  like everybody else   nah you could play it off  but i know youre all secretly mad  cause we finally have a black disney princess   you know there actually hasnt been a white princess  since 1991   tiana mulan pocahontas jasminewow shes right   there are little blonde girls in this country  who have no idea they can be beautiful  thats why i started jennas kids  its a summer camp that teaches pretty blonde girls  how to be mean   you call toofer beg him to come back   absolutely not  of course not  the aryan hates and fears the african man  as we so clearly saw in the blade movies   what no i didnt want toofer to quit  but i respect his decision  as a woman in this business   oh stop that  shut up liz   in this world i have never received special treatment  at work or in love  so why should anybody else  oh liz groans   i love coming here you

the red carpet with me   okay   youre selfconscious about our age difference  and you thought youd look old standing next to me   i see youre very perceptive   i get why its on your mind  what with your birthday and my amazing skin  and sure people in this restaurant  might think youre my dad   or that youre my prostitute   exactly but what does it matter   uh maybe it does matter  i mean yeah if id met you 20 years ago  well not you because you would have been 16  which is of course wrong  im just saying are we kidding ourselves with this  im 51 years old  do you even know who lee marvin is   the sportscaster who bites ladies  who cares   then again if i were with someone my own age  id miss out on a lot of things i want  id never have a family  jack  relax  weve only been together a month  we dont need to worry about this stuff now  especially not on your birthday   are these the cufflinks   reagan was buried in  dont ask how i got them  but i do know the access code to his

 god liz youre so negative   oh now you just sound like jack   hey im no relationship expert  the last time i used a birth control device  it was the 70s and it looked like soap on a rope  but every time you say what you dont want  you sound like a cranky cow and youre not that  youre smart and youre fun  so stop talking about what you dont want  and start figuring out what you do want  and then go get it   slurred speech jerem look how drunk i am  and how full of cheese my mouth is   thats not that much cheese  whistle blows players shouting   no no dont   no its okay i dont want to hurt you  but ill tell you what i do want  i want someone who will be monogamous  and nice to his mother  and i want someone who likes musicals  but knows to just shut his mouth when im watching lost  and i want someone who thinks being really into cars is lame  and strip clubs are gross  i want someone who will actually empty the dishwasher  instead of just taking out forks as needed  like i do  i want someone with clean hands and feet  and beefy forearms like a damn disney prince  and i want him to genuinely like me  even when im old  and thats what i want   european accent you making much english
