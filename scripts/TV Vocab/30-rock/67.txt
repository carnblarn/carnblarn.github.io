he confided in me hes got a little something  going with one of the girls here  maybe its that russian dancer with the tattoos  which is the crazy sex trifecta  that girl has a name jack  we call her skankovitch  im sure you disapprove  but the workplace has a hierarchy  and danny is a star  all the pretty little things down here  always want to be with the people up here  whatever  as long as hes discreet about it  its a younger mans game lemon  but i cant say that i dont miss it  youd be in your office late at night  the new girl would come in with some flimsy excuse  to be there  imitating

oh thatd be great  sue youre probably wondering why we asked you  to join the entourage  well over the years ive had a complicated relationship  with women from my treatment of the dancers here  to my remarks about madeleine albright  at the 1996 white house correspondents dinner  what its true  she does look like one of those  now that mr jordans having a daughter  he wants to learn to give all women  the respect they deserve  even you foreigners  thats why im adding a daughter  to the entourage family  now whats on the schedule for today  1000 am dotcom shows up pictures  from his trip to

majors at the royal tampa academy  of dramatic tricks  you can try to fight getting older  you can be like madonna and cling to youth  with your gollum arms or you can be  like meryl streep and embrace your age with elegance  so youre saying its a choice  between the dignity of middle age  and the illusion of youth  two paths  meryl streep or madonna  very well  i will emulate my acting inspiration  a woman of profound poise whose career  is what we all aspire to   okay this buildup is making me nervous  a woman whose feminine grace and normal outfits  are an inspiration  just say who it is and ill feel better  someone whose very name stands  for enduring beauty and the wonder of womanhood   please dont say  madonna  sighs  hey danny  hey liz  look i know were supposed to

earlier  i realized something  you take danny away from work  whenever you want to hang out  i dont think this is about the show  i think you have some sort of problem  with the fact that danny is
