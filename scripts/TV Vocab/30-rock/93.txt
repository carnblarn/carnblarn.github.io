economic summit  its going to be  very erotic  look at us being all adulty  i packed underwear whispers that isnt gray   gasps  isnt it nice  dating someone you have so much in common with  like you avery is a typea nut job  and of course you and carol share  your trademark stubbornness  we are not stubborn were principled  have a nice trip lemon  break out those underpants but be careful  dating yourself is a doubleedged sword  it means you also share the same flaws  well that would only be a problem if i had any flaws  not only is your fly open  theres a pencil sticking out of it  good day

guess youve made it to the next level  i look forward to seeing how this empowers you  to make my life more difficult  as am i liz lemon  itll probably involve a guitarplaying chimpanzee  that i bought this morning   no  uh hold on  dotcom is confirming that he drowned  oh  why are you putting me in a suit  i still havent memorized my torah passage  oh youre going to a lunch for the council on poverty  and this afternoon  youre speaking at the clinton foundation  speaking  that doesnt sound like me that sounds like work  yeah well the next level isnt all fun  success is a doubleedged sword  youre actually respected now  like it or not people are gonna expect you  to use that power for good  come on sir arms  theres a line sir  i realize youre more important  than everyone else on the flight  what with those jet sweatpants  excuse me young lady  are you old enough to be traveling alone  i dont know im going to visit my nana  but im scared  ooh wait thats too young  roger that ugh look at sweatpants guy  this is a 90 million aircraft  not a tallahassee strip club  stewart  excuse me mr sweatpants  were gonna need to check that bag  and that is sky law  hey  going to raleigh for a business meeting  im a businessman  im not an air marshal  over pa good afternoon folks  this is captain burnett from the flight deck  theres some traffic on the runway  should be about a half hour  then well have you on your way  so sit back relax enjoy your flight   thanks for choosing air bike  the pilot is my boyfriend  so if you have any questions during the flight  maybe i can theres a man on the wing  oh chuckles  we havent taken off yet its just a mechanic  and this is the prime ministers suite  oh there it is  the metro toronto convention center  site of the g8 summit  lets do it on the balcony  you might have to start without me  no problem  well if you need anything else   ah  oh god youre breaking  the extra bone all canadians have in their hands  oh jack i think the babys coming  what youre not due until march  why did i buy a beryllium mine  if her birthstone isnt going to be aquamarine  we need to get to the airport  airport we need to get you to a hospital  no we cant go to a hospital this is canada   if shes born here  good god  shell be canadian  at the risk of sounding incredibly rude  i would beg your pardon and ask you in your opinion  whats so bad aboot being canadian  your milk comes in bags bags  your pavilion at epcot doesnt have a ride  and if canada is so nice and friendly  why does most of our meth  come from your asian drug gangs  gasps are we not even making our own meth  what is happening to american manufacturing  take our things downstairs and get us a car to the airport  oh my god jack  if our child is born here she cant be presid  dont even say it  were having an american and she will be president  no matter how ridiculous that sentence sounds  if only we were in kenya right now wed be fine  both laughing  gasps oh  choking if this is helping you im fine  and in conclusion bless you tracy jordan  your gripping portrayal of djeffrey lucky seeda  in hard to watch has given a voice  to the voiceless americas poor  applause  im not scared of you people  and i dont think those cashews  look like a bowl of baby penises  sobbing being an egot is fun  heres to me spending the rest of my life  in rooms like this  applause  baby crying  sighs  didnt they say half an hour over an hour ago  pa beeps excuse me  while were waiting to take off were going to go ahead  and begin our inflight entertainment  which is the feature film  legend of the guardians the owls of gahoole  and some nbc sitcoms that didnt make the schedule  all grumbling  we have to find the guardians eglantine  owls hooting hey  hey lizzie you okay  people are starting to get a little antsy back there  yeah its gonna be about another half hour  really cause i checked flight tracker on my phone  and our status is just an angry red frowny face  okay you want to know a little pilot secret  besides the fact that we get a discount at sunglass hut  the halfhour thing is a trick  its enough time so that people know  theyre gonna have to wait but it doesnt upset them  so youre just lying  thats not right were paying customers  look liz we have reasons  for doing the things the way that we do  when we say half an hour  to control the herds of walking mozzarella sticks  who think that 300 and a photo id  gives them the right to fly through the air  like one of the guardian owls of legend  god thats been our inflight movie for months  i just think its frustrating for people  to know that theyre being lied to  maybe you just want to fly the plane yourself  well good luck pressing  take off then auto pilot then land  okay this is obviously a tense situation for you  i didnt mean to make it worse  just do what you need to do and well get where were going  uhhuh nags head  oh no soren its metalbeak  you have to stay awake eglantine  or the pure ones will moonblink us  about half an hour  canada  every flight is cancelled   no  i called the concierge service  with my amex invisible card  there are no rental cars  the trains and buses are sold out  well how far is the border maybe we can run  i dont know when i asked the lady at the desk   she told me in kilometers  ohh  look avery you and i are cut from the same cloth  its one of the reasons we work so well  and why were unbeatable at a threelegged race  we ruined those kids field day  but being similar has its drawbacks  its a both doubleedged sword  so could our shared patriotism and refusal to ever give up be  in this situation a bad thing   what are you saying jack  avery  maybe it isnt the end of the world  if our daughter is canadian  alexander hamilton was born in the west indies   and he went on to  to what jack  be a mouthpiece for federalism  and then die in a duel against someone named aaron  is that what you want our daughter to be  a biggovernment duel loser  no  baby crying  where did all those babies come from  dear god theyve restarted the failed nbc shows  oh no please no not gals on the tour again  love and friendship having it all   or maybe just a great pair of shoes   one of them has to be asian   can they be good at their jobs   those bathrooms are disgusting  someone has to do something  please do something  you said you knew the captain  all right  you know what this is wrong  i can see the terminal from my window  where people are buying new magazines  and crossing their legs  and eating at a chilis express  we were like them once and we can be again  but were just airplane folk now  no we still have our dignity  and maybe we cant go back to the terminal  but i know captain burnett  he is a reasonable person  he compromises readily on movie choices and  and sexual positions  i mean if we as a group  can decide what reasonable things we want  id be happy to talk to him  all yeah  okay i cant turn the air on  because id have to power the engines up  that wastes fuel  im assuming you dont want to stop for gas  in the middle of the ocean  okay what about the bathrooms  stewart did not study dance at carnegie mellon  to become a flight attendant to clean bathrooms  well at least give us some food  negative those potatochip bags  are designed to be opened in flight  you open them at sea level somebody could be killed  and can you tell me when we might be in the air captain  sure in about a half an hour  okay carol you have a decision to make  are your passengers just cattle  or are some of them maybe even just one of them  someone you care about  i think you need to make a decision  am i just another authority figure  that youre taking one of your stands against  like that police horse you yelled at  if i cant poop in the street why should my tax dollars   pay for someone else to  or am i your boyfriend  who youre gonna let do his job  really if this is you doing your job  youre terrible at it  think about what youre doing  you are making a choice here i am not just a passenger  soft beeping  gasps  and the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign  all passengers including any lipless middleaged women  in lesbian clown shirts  should please take their seat at this time  uh mr jordan several messages for you  breakfast with chuck schumer  i dont want to watch that guy eat  5k homeless walk that just seems cruel  cornell commencement address  sorry but tracy jordan doesnt do safety schools  the next level sucks  ah you got to be careful  you ever hear of the peter principle   yes just now  the reason people are unhappy  in their careers is that they keep  getting promoted until theyre in over their heads  the peter principle says  you rise to the level of your incompetence  but my incompetence knows no bounds  stay in your comfort zone  if it was me id just hide out  until people forgot who i was  but keep in mind we hornbergers are famous cowards  on dday my grandfather wore a german uniform  under his american one just in case  theres a reason that men like that  arent chosen for greatness  i dont remember saying  you could listen to that conversation  but continue  imagine if mr hornberger were in your shoes  and he turned his back on his community  on the world  how would he sleep at night  how would he look his children in the eye  or perform his husband bedroom duties  for instance painting the bedroom  think about the shame  he would be run out of town  al sharpton would denounce him  at a press conference on the street  because al sharpton doesnt have an office  exactly  i thought going to the next level would be amazing ken  like guitarplaying chimpanzee amazing  god bless and keep him  but now everybody expects me to do all of this stuff  and i dont want to let anybody down but im scared  chuckles  you dont know the meaning of the word scared  and i know because ive looked it up for you  a dozen times laughing  horn honking   oh thank god  hop in  no no dont go back there   you guys drive  what  you drive while we hide out in the back  hang out in the back  everythings normal  no smoking  uh yyeah okay  okay  thanks honey  great im lorne  if youre a cop you have to tell me  im just kidding were all on vacation  hissing liquid bubbling  ah  whispering is this a mobile meth lab  whispering yes it is   look if you want to quit  quit  ive never quit anything in my life  im still in girl scouts i have 9000 badges  hey im still looking for a golf ball i shanked in 1987  i am not taking that penalty stroke  good we agree  now lets drive this bomb to buffalo  and get this little bitch out of me  man crying   weve been offered a gate  what  well what are you doing back here   come on lets go  oh well go  well go back to the terminal and the lounge  with the reclining chairs and the turkey wraps  stomach growling turkey wraps  and well forget any of this ever happened  like the fact that you insulted me  in front of my entire crew especially stewart  who often makes up hurtful nicknames for me   like mr bumpy landing  great  and ill forget the fact that you treated us like animals  oh well ive already forgotten  that you said i was bad at my job  when everything tgs has been so great recently  austin powers on crossfire timely stuff  uhhuh and im not even gonna ask  what the hell that voice is that you use on the intercom  mockingly uh folks half an hour means forever uhhhh  laughing  can i tell you what i hate about you  youre so stubborn when you think youre right  even when the answer is on the trivial pursuit card  the card was wrong and youre no better carol  you built that bookshelf incorrectly  i did not i wanted the books to slide off  okay listen liz  we will get through this  if for once you can just let it go  i will take us back to the gate  when you stand up in front of my crew and my passengers  and admit that you were wrong   what  admit that i  as captain of this vessel was in the right  you were wrong to question me  and i was correct in my treatment  of you and your fellow animals  id rather die on this plane  that can be arranged  um you saw the back of the

hospital  not driving to buffalo in a snowstorm  thank you for your input lorne  but avery and i want our daughter to be born in america  so she can one day become president  and declare war on germany like back when we were awesome  you know you remind me of my parents  i find that very hard to believe  they were both really intense  they wanted me to grow up to be prime minister  so as a kid i had to win the spelling bee  they made me memorize  all 700 words in the canadian dictionary  and then i had to go to law school   you went to law school  for one day  i was just so tightly wound that i got kicked out  for karate chopping my roommate  i know chuckles im a stereotype  all guys from quebec are good at karate  god  oh my god where are my manners  do you want to try meth
