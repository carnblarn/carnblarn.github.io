for jenna maroney  jenna this is a really big deal  i agree  its an opportunity to finally  put a projenna president in the white house  someone who respects the human fetus  and recognizes its value as a hair volumizer  you have 24 hours then well all meet back here  and you present your cases  maybe ill ask questions  maybe you two can take turns arguing  like debate  like debarge i love debarge

my absentee ballot from stone mountain  until this year i wasnt allowed to vote  because reverend gary said choosing is a sin  but then reverend todd said reverend gary is dead  long live reverend todd so here we are  good for you krock  voting is a great american tradition  like laziness or uh  eh im so excited  i mean the parcells have been in this country  since we went berserk and murdered everybody at roanoke  but i never felt like a true american until today  like how you mustve felt four years ago  when you finally got to vote for a president who looks like you  black shrek ran for president  no sir obama  i forgot about that halfnerd  probably because i get all my news  from social media and ive been banned from all social media  you have why  someone has to be the first person  to make a joke after a celebrity dies  i guess i was a little too soon with andy griffith  what did you say  i cant unhear it i cant unhear it  happy election eve obama 2012  the first africanamerican president  ever to be up for reelection whoo historical  dude thats not happening this year   no ones that excited  then get excited  remember how fun it was in 2008  come on well have

that whole night was a onetime thing pete  no ones gonna get that psyched a second time  why not its like when you do karaoke and everyones like  that was a really good american pie pete  you knew all the words  and then you put it on again  and everyone leaves because no one can top it  thats what this is gonna be like  four more years  four more years thats the spirit  four more years  okay jack  i was hoping that we could get through this campaign  without going negative  i agree  youre the one using negative words  like without and negative  uhhuh  so what was that attack ad that i saw on the tgs feed  liz lemon says shes jenna maroneys friend  but lets look at the facts  in 2011 liz said  the same polyps jenna had prayed for  and what does liz say when shes behind closed doors  really liz  liz lemon  research indicates that that ad is polling  quite well with both manic and depressive jenna  you know jennas a liberal jack  shes a slut monster  and one of gay americas top hags  but this is what you do  you trick people into voting against their own interests  and then you sell them out at the drop of a hat  first of all i have never dropped a hat in my life  and dont be so sure about jennas politics  shes aging mean and rich that sounds republican to me  jenna is overly sensitive prone to hysteria  and having been shot and left for dead  in three different deserts pro gun control  she is one of us  unbelievable  seven years ive been mentoring you  and i havent been able to move you an inch  good god lemon  enough with the histrionics  herstrionics  since youve known me ive been right about no less  than everything always yet you persist  in this impotent emotional weltanschauung  and its not just politics  for instance i bet you bought those hideous shoes  for some emotional reason  for every pair you buy they give a pair to a child  that was forced to work in the factory that makes these shoes  its not great but you know what  im the one whos in a stable relationship jack  i like my job  and i am one punch away from getting  a free deviled egg at that cool new deviled egg place  so maybe you should let me rub off on you  you wish you pervert  let me leave you with this jack  you may have your dirty tricks  but dont ever underestimate me when it comes to  phone plays the trashmens surfin bird  its my gynecologist  doctor thank you for calling me back  did anyone leave a bag of burger king in your office  local ballot initiatives  proposition one  empowers the mayor of stone mountain to perform  necessary repairs on the towns historic clock tower  oh that old clock tower  nobody knows what its counting down to  well i want to vote yes  but how do i know thats the right thing to do  well what do the procon statements say  okay writing in favor is mayor debbie herself  hey im gonna take the clock apart myself  then put it back together  i wanna see how it works  my friend jojo did it with a toaster and its still good  lemme do it  she makes some good points  but the con is written  by the hermit what lives in the clock tower  aint nobody touch my clock  its my wife and its where i do my sniperin  now i dont know what to think  voting is a big responsibility  to this day i have to live with the fact  that i cast the deciding vote  choked up that made white  the newest flavor of mountain dew  but i guess thats just life in a democracy  hola mi amo dora  chuckles hey maria   hey its election day  mm hmm  huge party upstairs tonight just like 2008   ill see you there  oh i wish  my shift ends at 600 now  so youll be gone before they declare a winner  unless they call it early  yes  anything can happen  chuckles hope and change  i think the slogan this year is forward  oh yeah laughs  welcome to the first and only debate  of the jennaral election  both laugh  insincere  today we choose the future for a nation  and for a woman people magazine once called  an unnamed friend of the deceased  today finally it is truly all about me  liz well start with your opening statement  when your time is up youll hear this sound  oh say can you see  and the home of the  brave  jenna this election is about emotion  its about which candidate cares the most  cares the most about the issues  that truly matter to jenna maroney  for example your reproductive rights  do you want a bunch of old men behind closed doors  deciding what you can and cannot do with your body  ooh and how do they tell me their decisions  do i get shocked whenever i do the wrong thing  what no jenna not that  god  earlier today i met a family  the alfreds from lakecity florida  sorry lake city  the alfreds are huge jenna maroney fans  because jenna maroney is so so talented  claps  please hold your applause until the end  but under mitt romney  the arts program at traci lords middle school  where little shauna is a seventh grader  would be gutted  without music appreciation class  how would shauna know how much she appreciates you  a world without arts programs sounds terrible  where would young blonde girls like shauna  learn to act and sing  why if arts funding was cut within a short time  our schools would be producing no new actresses  and jenna maroney would get every part  thats my america thats mitt romneys america  clapping  my next question refers to an issue that i know  deeply affects the vast majority of jenna maroney  which political party is cooler  thats no contest jenna  the president listens to hiphop rappings  we have the coolest celebrities  scarlett johansson blake lively jessica biel  wow  those are all very beautiful women  do you really want to be photographed next to them  let me tell you who we have  craig t nelson chuck norris and charlton hestons skull  youd be the only cool republican  jenna you need to trust me here  have i ever steered you wrong  i stopped you when you wanted to join  that white tiger magic show  i stopped you when you tried to drive us into lake michigan  because scottie pippin got married  listen to me jenna  and listen to your heart  miss lemon i know scottie pippin  i own a fuddruckers with scottie pippin  and you sir look like scottie

jordan i need your help  whats wrong ken  i havent been able to make  a single decision on this absentee ballot  should we take apart the clock tower  should we let old man merkel marry his daughter  or make him bury her like the rest of the dead folks  ill never know enough to make an informed decision  informed decision  do you think this country was founded on informed decisions  well of course  columbus thought he was in india  and did he worry about being wrong no  he just called everybody indians  and we still do it today why cause  you want to be an american  you fill out that ballot  because you dont know what youre doing  just like when we named this country after  the fourth or fifth guy who discovered it  amerigo vespucci who cares  america thats my boy  how do you sleep at night jack  i dont i take thousands of micro naps during the day  well you know what  snores no lemon what  im glad you never succeeded in turning me into you  because i would rather lose with my head held high  partly because when i have it down it looks like this  than win the wrong way  lemon i dont enjoy  manipulating jenna for my own ends  to be perfectly honest i dont like mitt romney  the man doesnt drink  how does he let a moment land chuckles  but im not going to allow those feelings  get in the way of doing what is right  think of the children jack  what if jenna had picked the president  when you were a little boy  where would that kid be today  maybe we should ask him  boston 1968  bad boston accent later ma  im goin down the park to play ball  i sure love america  almost as much as i love chowder  im sorry are you trying to make  one of your emotional appeals to me  oh my god its future me  lemon this kind of sentimental nonsense  didnt work with jenna  it certainly wont work with the man  who didnt cry at field of dreams  not even when the bank  failed to recoup its investment in the farm  fine enjoy your president im moving to france  except i cant get a decent iced tea there forget it  snores  everyone ask to vote immediately  this election has to be over by 600   thanks for coming by  okay  williams  williams i need you to call it for obama right now
