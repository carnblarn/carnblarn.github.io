a paycheck  no we do a show every friday tracy  its not gonna work  next friday is damon dashs birthday party  and the friday after that theres an orgy over at elizabeth hasselbecks  yeah well youre part of a team now okay  so you have to be in the shows and you have to rehearse  and when you rehearse jenna would really like it  i would like it too  if you would read exactly whats on the cue cards  its making everybody crazy  cant do it  im an improviser  my acting style is like jazz  jazz that you laugh at  ah ha ha ha ha ah ha ha ha ha  just try okay  i have a meeting upstairs ill be right back  pete  do you remember that song i recorded last year  when i was dating that persian record producer  ohno  its a dancepop techno hybrid called muffin top  i gave everybody copies at christmas  oh yeah right i dont remember that  well apparently its a numberone hit in israel  hey israel wow yes  and i noticed we had a couple of minutes left  so i thought maybe i could do it on the show  okay you can do the short version  you should know that muffin top is also number four in belgium  i said you could do it  why not  oh i mean thank you  hello  for over a hundred years ge has been imagining the future today  and im here to talk to you today about a wonderful new synergy  its called product integration  its revolutionizing the way we monetize broadcast television  how does it work simple  all you have to do as the writing staff of an nbc show  is incorporate positive mentions or posmensof ge products into your program  for example you could write an episode where one of your characters purchases  and is satisfied with  one of ges directcurrent drilling motors for an offshore or landbased project  product integration  setting a new standard in upward revenue stream dynamics  for all of us  now id be happy to answer any questions  im sorry youre saying you want us to use the show to sell stuff  look i know how this sounds  no come on jack were not doing that  were not compromising the integrity of the show to sell  wow this is diet snapple  i know it tastes just like regular snapple doesnt it  you should try plumagranate  its amazing  i only date guys who drink snapple  look we all love snapple  lord knows i do but focus here  were talking about product integration  no no we are not your shills  oh ohho im sorry  thats right theyre artists  like james joyce or strindberg  get real kids  you write skits mocking our presidents to fill time between car commercials  thats not fair  josh gets a lot of fan mail for gaybraham lincoln  did you guys know that holland is the only country with a national dog  i didnt know that  hmm theres little facts under there  thats a lunch break everybody  back in an hour please  um did you talk to tracy about reading the cue cards  i tried  well hes not reading them  he never reads them liz  im starting to think he cant read  oh that thats just offensive jenna  i dont know  have you ever seen him read anything  of course like when we shoot promos  hi im tracy jordan im black nbc  very proud like peacocks right janet  hmm  hey tracy i missed that last runthrough  could you run it once off cards for me  naw lemon  ill do that later i gotta bounce  okay thats the  it says emergency exit only he couldnt read that  man jennas really gotten squirrelly since tracy came along  its so sad  whats really sad is that while shes in this fragile state  none of her friends are messing with her head  i think we should do something about that  hmm  shh okay all right  hey  what are you guys talking about  oh uhnothing  what is it about me  okay um  theres a rumor going around that donaghy has to cut costs around here  oh  yeah my friend in accounting lando calrissian  he says jacks probably gonna have to fire an actor  oh  thank you guys for telling me  its like shooting fish in a barrel  yeah if the fish have daddy issues  i cant believe you guys actually wrote a product integration sketch  jack said we had to  it just seems weird  this shows not a commercial  excuse me  can you tell me where human resources is please  that way thanks  this is gonna sound crazy but um  tracy can read right  what are you serious  the guys done dozens of movies  yeah but its not like his movies seem like hes reading a script  lets go rescue karen or whatever  is there a cheryl  then she could tell us where drugs are i mean gold  then we got the car chase im getting way too old for this  was i supposed to say that then  thats true  and he never reads the cue cards  god i thought all that stuff was just crazy tracy seeing what he could get away with  i know but you know its not surprising  look at the educational system in this country  we spend all this money in iraq but meanwhile  our innercity graduation rates are lower than they are in the sudan  that  doesnt sound right  maybe it was sweden maybe it was teen pregnancy  i gotta read more  what can i do for you  so we wrote a product integration sketch  good but we wanted to run it by you first  because its about how ge is making us do this  and we were kinda hoping that the ge executive in the sketch could be played byyou  oh i get it  the whole selfreferential thing  letterman hates the suits stern yells at his boss  nixons sock it to me on laughin  yeah  hippy humor  thats what im going for  well as you know ive been studying comedy  and learning whats funny  im watching friends right now what happens with ross and rachel  no no dont tell me seriously what were you saying  so will you do it  i dont know lemon im

donaghy on the cast list  oh hes gonna do this ge sketch  its really funny  oh so he gets to be in sketches but hes gonna fire one of the real actors  what  i got inside information that jack is gonna fire one of the actors to cut costs  no i havent heard anything like that  dont worry about it  oh im not worried  because i have something the other actors dont  a secret weapon  oh dont say your sexuality  my sexuality  oh god jenna when has that ever worked  uh when has it not worked  itll be a 45minute wait  oh will it  uh yeah  yeah yeah it will  yeah but this is different because i know

important  oh  line  damn it son of a bitch  lemon  i need your help  really jack donaghy needs my  dont gloat  it makes you seem mannish  okay  look this is not your fault  this whole thing was a bad idea  we should just have josh do it and well just tell everyone youre on a business trip  thats not an option i have to do it  once i set my mind to something i have to accomplish it  ten years ago i was an inchandahalf shorter than i am today  sheer willpower  if i dont figure this thing out by friday then failure wins and thats not acceptable  oh god the room is spinning  what do you want from me  im one of your actors im freaking out  talk me down  okay heres your pep talk  youre not an actor youre jack donaghy all right  so quit whining and nut up  youre right if you cant do this you are a failure  josh can do this and earlier today he ate a club sandwich  with the toothpicks still in it  jenna can do this and she was once engaged to david blaine  any dumbdumb can act jack so be a man and get it done  if you were any other woman on earth i would be turned on right now  go home  get some sleep  this stays between us right lemon  lemon  lemon  lemon  well i dont think i have to worry

racist mess thinking a grown man is illiterate  thats the subtle racism of lowered expectations  bing crosby said that  no bill cosby said that  thats racist  look we can all agree liz is generally pretty racist  the point is you have people counting on you  you cant be finding excuses not to be here  but this job is hard  i just want to be able to do what i want to do  you know i once shot a whole movie without ever getting out of my car  yeah i paid to see that that was supposed to be a western  youre not a big shot movie star anymore tray  youre the star of tgs and you will read the lines as written  starting tonight because this show is important  i set a very high standard for myself  and i expect the same of the professionals who work with me  when gaybraham lincoln gets hit in the crotch can i go crosseyed  oh yes do that thats hilarious  hey have you seen frank or toofer  pete  the standards lady is saying that my moaning in muffin top is too graphic  which of these is less offensive  ahh ahh  ahhh  or  oohhunh  unhhunh  ohhh  both sound good to me  hello ron  i would just hate for muffin top to get cut because of a standards problem  ive already posted it on my
