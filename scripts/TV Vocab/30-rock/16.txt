klumps  is this about ridikolus  because i think youre overreacting  look i am old school  growing up when you were mad at somebody you would just break dance at em  im talking about break hard pull it back pop boom boom  into gladiator  bring it back down  yeah im familiar with break dancing  okay  worm it out  and then pop  boom  now brothers just shoot you  oh no no  look  ridikolus is the biggest hiphop producer in new york city  and he was disrespected at my party  this may be a great opportunity  for what  to unload some of this awful wine  tracy for years cristal was the hiphop champagne  until the president of roederer committed a fateful error  cristal has since been boycotted in the rap community  creating a vacuum which could be filled by donaghy estates sparkling wine  which according to this lab report  contains no lead and is not fatal if swallowed  mm  if you get rich off of this stuff just take care of my family  i dont want my kids to have to go to college  tracy im not gonna let anything happen to you  you have my word  to success  is that a piece of corn in there  so uh you like comedy  mmhmm  have you heard of mark russell  yeah thats the guy that

monsters  im talking about the strategic defense initiative  yeah we should probably go ahead and order  this porterhouse for two looks good  im just gonna get a salad  i really dont care about food  and yet no brand has emerged to fill that market gap at present  there is no club drink  thats where donaghy estates comes in  now as you may have read in robert parkers wine newsletter  donaghy estates tastes like  the urine of satan after a hefty portion of asparagus  but this is not a question of taste  sure  i mean its about branding its about perception  exactly and the ideal opportunity to launch a new drink label  is right around the corner  the source awards  well im producing the source awards  and i would like donaghy estates to be your corporate sponsor  you ever have more money than you could shake a stick at  well pick out a stick  cause ridikolus is gonna be drinking donaghy estates tonight  excellent  now i also hope this means youll set aside your problem  with my friend tracy jordan  no i dont think i could let that go that easy  what if he makes it up to you  whos hosting the source awards  what about tracy  hey matthew you want some juicy office gossip  theyre
