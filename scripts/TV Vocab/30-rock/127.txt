heroes  worked together to be greater than the sum of their parts  bronson was the brawn  attenborough was the brains  garner was the scrounger  mcqueen was the hottie with the body  ill say it  and

go horribly wrong  look when no conceivable good can come of something  dont engage  i would love to keep arguing with tracy  about whether women are funnier than monkeys  i once saw a monkey in a cowboy outfit  i would love to see the town  hes the sheriff of  the point is why do i care what tracy thinks  i dont cause i know the truth  women are just as funny as men  and you know the truth too  i do  i am the complete package  i dont need to know what one thing i give zarina  i mean who cares   not me  great  so were not engaging  this is growth jack  and we are gonna celebrate  by going to

old prostitute trying to look young  commentary  old thank you tracy  thats the only reason i did this  and it was spectacular  gerald you came  you bet i did baby  theres nothing older than trying to be young  and you looked like a million years up there  congratulations  you are gerichairs  new spokescrone  lolo jones a man couldnt even do  that doctor sketch  we wouldve just been sitting there  listening to his medical advice  you were right liz lemon  women can be funny  you know what ill take it  stride of pride  jenna  jack im sorry  i didnt think anyone would be up here this late  sometimes i like to come up here at night  and flash my breasts at the empire state building  is that the only building that you flash  or do you also flash the time warner center  to make the empire state building  feel like an old fool  are you all right jack  you look like that flash card they told me means sadness  i have to break it off with a woman im seeing  i found out im just an aging squirtle  in her pokemon  thats tough  accepting the way other people see us  can be difficult  i mean inside i still feel like a sex idiot  but i have to accept the fact that im fake 56 now  and im more of a diane lane ageless beauty  but dont fight it embrace it  look  do you really want this girl asking you  to go hear her friend dj in brooklyn  no that sounds exhausting  do you want to drive five hours  to go rock climbing with her  and be expected to have sex after  i do not i mean my back  so dont break up with her  just be the older person  its fun  you get to say racist stuff whenever you want  and people bring you soup  i do like soup  okay so maybe i never got my sex and the city brunch  and maybe i never got to share the fact  that i now know four different sexual positions  one of which involves a chair  but maybe a good relationship is more than that anyway  all this talk of greatescaping and pokemons got me thinking  is accepting who you are  the secret to getting what you want  action  gerichair makes it safe  for me to spend christmas alone  do men and women really see the world so differently  or can we agree that were all just monkeys with suitcases  trying to seem like people  well played professor  wait youre a female  how you doin girl  can we get everything we need from one person  or is that what friends are for  to be the allied pows  and whimsical japanese minicreatures  that help us get through life  now this is how people danced  before chubby checker ruined everything  i guess what im saying is  i need to modify my zappos order  so please
