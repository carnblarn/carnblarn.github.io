not gonna regret this you know  because its not just cute guys that buy these magazines  its teenage boys with weird rashes  and old guys that live at the y  liz posing in maxim is a great career move  theres no shame in it  im laughin im horny lets do this  put the chicken near your mouth  awesome  oh  well you look happy  somebody just have a root beer float  no joshs contract is up which means

12 to 24  which is important to advertisers  because young women will buy just about anything  these sunglasses have a chip in them that makes the lenses change color  as my ipod loses power  but whatever josh brings to the show hes still replaceable  hes not replaceable as my friend  hes not your friend now hes your opponent  hes going to try to grab all the marbles and its our job to hide them  thats not how you play marbles jack  but thats how you keep them  yo remember that email we got from those nigerians  that needed our help gettin all that money out of africa  we did it  i got the check today  say word  word is bond  i would have been happy if our only reward was just helping  that dethroned prince of nigeria but this is great  we should treat ourselves  want to go to vegas

thats the same joke mr jordan said earlier  i dont think so k   cause i like to keep my material fresh  i like to keep things fresh so much that i wanna take it out  behind the middle school and get it pregnant  whoa who just killed me  thats never happened before  i did mr jordan  thats impossible  ive beat all the worlds best players  grizz dotcom my publicist my stylist  oh well  i just killed you again  youre cheating  and i dont wanna play no more  i hate this  grizz  i think its best you come sit on me  and i just want the troops to kill everyone and come on home  pretty good  but this is hardball jenna so you might wanna be more specific  you could say that you support the troops  but you feel that the war was poorly planned  and started under false pretenses  and that we should have used those resources to hunt down osama bin laden  liz im just worried that im gonna  sound like i dont know what im talking about  hey would sharon stone worry about that  mmmm  would richard gere  no  then you go out there and you voice your opinions like a star  okay what are you gonna do if they ask about 08  well of course i want hillary to be the first woman president  ugh  no obama  you support barrack obama  remember you liked those pictures of him at the beach  oh right  obama what is he hispanic  no hes black  and hes running for president  good luck  is this new furniture  this is my negotiation set  what  gentlemen please sit down  all right lets skip the foreplay and get right to the penetraish  josh is looking for a 15 raise a twopic guarantee from universal  and time off for every jewish holiday no matter how ridiculous  i mean yaznach is coming up  that seems pretty reasonable right jack  heres my counteroffer  one dollar  what  oh boy   thats absurd  you know whats absurd  these photos i found of josh roughhousing with lance bass at seaworld  what we were just being silly  my offer is now 75 cents  tic toc tic toc tic toc  it keeps getting lower  i think we should take it  relax  look jack  we know about the testing  women from 12 to 24 love my guy  who told you that  oh liz did  shut up  what  that was privileged information  thats what i thought  awse  we are back in the game  i knew you werent ready for a big chair  yo kenneth we need to talk man  oh ive had this conversation before  youre marrying my mom arent you  no  its about how youre treating tracy  youre beating him at halo youre not laughing at his jokes  hes the king around here you gotta respect that  oh my gosh  i had no idea i was causing a problem  hey i got next game  hold up  how are you beating kenneth grizz  i dont know  if kenneth can beat me and you can beat kenneth  then by the transitive property you should beat me too  have you been letting me win  just at some things  things  plural  what is the worlds only egglaying mammal  the easter bunny  right again  thats a green pie piece  amazed  raaah  yeah what cat  yeah dotcom  yeah grizz  have you two been treating me like this all this time  like a child  no no no i wont stand for this  entourage disbanded  oh my  tucker carlson you heard what jenna maroney had to say  she supports the troops  well heres a question chris  why do we care what she thinks about anything  this woman strikes me as another emptyheaded  selfinvolved member of the hollywood ignorati  you know for someone whos super super hot  youre really cranky  i have just as much right to my opinion as you or chris  im not sure you do  youve been on the show for 20 minutes now  you sang six bars of something called muffin top  thank you  and then told a disgusting story about fleet week  i guess this is the state of political discourse in this country nowadays  and thats fine lets just embrace it  lets have our policies determined by former cable ace award nominees  first i was great in that arliss  second of all if they president is so serious about the war of terror  why doesnt he hunt down and capture barrack obama before he strikes again  its time for a change america  thats why im voting for osama in 2008  oh no comeback  ya burnt  hey jack i was totally gonna call you  which of your massive screwups should we discuss first  how about the jenna situation  that is taken care of  i have written an op ed piece for the new york times  under jennas name in which i put the media on trial  boo heres the plan  were gonna take jenna put some flags behind her  have her sing a song that rhymes usa with make them pay  dress her in an eagle costume and were gonna call it  a salute to the troops episode  okay  moving on josh gerard  i had him right where i wanted him  until my partner stabbed me in the back  i didnt mean to do that im sorry  i was just trying to give my friend a heads up  why cant we all just sit down in normal chairs and figure this out  suri is josh in yet  josh isnt coming in today  hes sick  he said he was throwing up all night  a sick out  i didnt think he had it in him  what are you talking about  hes faking  hes gonna stay home until we give in to his demands  no josh could not come up with a sneaky plan like that  he told me he was a pallbearer at his brothers wedding  hes probably just sick because hes stressed out about his job  lemon what happened in your childhood to make you believe that people are good  you know what  if my friendships and my job are in compatible  i choose my friends  and right now i am going to get some chicken soup  from joshs favorite place and take it to him  and say that i hope he feels better  do you ever get any emails other
