your mother the truth  cause living a lie will eat you up inside  like that parasite i got from eating sushi on amtrak  and the case of the missing whisky    thats quite a suit kenneth  thank you sir  all my suits are my late fathers  mr  thats weird  kenneth since youve left the page program  finding you a new position here has been  one of the most difficult challenges of my career  and im including making it through the 80s  without having sex with belinda carlisle  i know sir  but i just couldnt work in ad sales  we have far too many sponsors  that make housework easier for women  thats why im putting you in the standards department  youll be responsible for keeping the airwaves free  of content that might offend any group  its a good starting place but kenneth  if you wanna make it in the business world  you cant be so morally stubborn  there are gray areas  no sir  theres always a right and wrong  before he died my father gave me a piece of advice  son if you wanna get ahead in this world  oh god this hurts tell your mother im gay  nerf rifle mass effect 3  what else do we need for uh research  well i need the deutsche grammophon box set   for my opera sketch  an opera  is there singing because i sing  tracy doesnt sing so i should do it  the audience expects it ill sleep with you  no jenna none of this stuff is really for sketches  were just saying that so we can charge it all to the show  its the perfect crime as long as pete never finds out  who drank this  this is the scotch i was saving for my birthday  someone with a key to my office  a janitor or a security guard or some black  hearted individual probably white  has ruined the hornberger hang  for all of us  lets get forensics in here  have the techs lift a latent print  and run it against afis  maybe the perps in the system  jmo you sound like a cop  and i should know  my uncle was a cop in a porno  tracy every blond actress in the business  has done a pilot about a tough but pretty lady cop  with special abilities  mine was called goodlooking  i played alexis goodlooking  who was also goodlooking  and my special ability was being good at looking for clues  lets get forensics in here  have the techs lift a latent print  and run it against afis  maybe the perps in the system  unlike my husbands killer who got away  and it haunts me  you know what  we should use your skills  to solve the case of petes missing booze  that was a long time ago tracy  my detective days are over  you sure about that  because like all black actors  i have a lot of experience with playing a wise black fellow  who gets reluctant white people to do things  well  im just an old fool of course  and i dont know much about politics or the like  but i do know americas kinda like this here  crab apple tree  john fitzgerald kennedy  all right ill do it  lets ride partner  i have some real problems  with this  we cant say dick wolf on tv  listen up standards and practices  i just had an emergency meeting with legal  and we can no longer use the words  hit great show fun or broadcast television  now kenneth  mr donaghy bradley tarkin junior compliance associate  we met last year at your completely silent presentation  on the power of eye contact  yes i believe it was entitled  i was just an intern then  but afterwards i got you to sign  my first edition jack attack  you know the first edition has a typo  when i took over microwaves i said to the team  by the end of this quarter  were all gonna be in the black comma guys  not were all gonna be in the black guys  anyway nice to meet you again bradley  kenneth a word  balloon  kenneth you are now officially  in the business world  bradley is trying to destroy you  destroy me  hes the best friend ive ever had  tied with everyone ive ever met  kenneth if you learn one thing from me its this  in business you have no friends  let me tell you a little story  there was once a man named henry warren  henry pretended to be my friend  but he turned out to be my very first nemesis  we got the contract  were gonna make the bottles for new coke  and im gonna make sure you get all the credit  aces  lets do some cocaine  my friendship with henry was a lie  we were just waiting for the chance to destroy the other one  but bradley gave me my nickname  susan  like lazy susan  cause im lazy and effeminate  bradley is dangerous last year he was an intern  now hes a junior compliance associate  how did he get promoted so quickly  i signed his book he had my signature  he probably put it on a forged letter of recommendation  sir thats awfully paranoid  exactly paranoid  from the greek para meaning beside  and noid which is some sort of a  pizza demon no that cant be right  the point is youve got to be paranoid kenneth  youve gotta go in there and crush bradley  like i crushed henry warren  but ive never crushed anyone  except accused witches  get in there   be cool be cool be cool  how did you get in here  frank said you couldnt come to dinner  because you werent feeling well  but i know the best thing for a fever  is food wine and cheek pinching  so i packed everything up  prayed to the patron saint of locked apartments   and here we are  no absolutely n  you dont have a say in this now lie down  while im here you do nothing  as we say in italy  eat an arancine  i love our little family  pete  yeah i saw him earlier today  why something wrong  someone drank his scotch  you wouldnt know anything about that would you  why would i  i was gonna drink it with him on his birthday  okay but if you think of anything  use this phone as a reminder to call us  i may not pick up  cause i lost my phone just now  if you think of anything  call us  hang on this chairs been moved  read him his rights  i should tell my husband im gonna be late tonight  no wait i cant hes dead  hang on  the trash was moved  hiding something mr lutz  okay i drank it we all drank it  we wanted booze but we didnt wanna hang out with pete  its the worst  he always brings out his guitar and sings  hes got one story and its about him  seeing phil donahue at a mall  now comes the worst part  the paperwork  whats wrong susan  mr pfister just took me to the woodshed  which i didnt even realize could be a metaphor  i guess i signed off on a script  where an asian character refers to rindsay rohan  posing for prayboy  but i know thats very offensive  especially because asians are underrepresented   on this network  exactly  if there are more actors of asian descent  shut up just shut up roy   i am talking to kenneth  im dealing with something  no one wants to hear from you  i dont even remember reading that script  its your signature on the memo  that does look like my x  susan as a friend  quit before they fire you  your meatballs are good  like ikea good  is there parmesan in this  and lemon and a little fennel  are you sure youre not italian liz  maybe from the north  thats where the vampires used to live  whats the matter frank youre so quiet  youre sitting at dinner next to a beautiful older woman  eat something and kiss her  no i cant do this  ma liz isnt the l in that letter  its lynn onkman  elizabeth im gonna ask you to leave  but this is my  i dont think bradleys my friend  i hate to say told ya because it reminds me  of my onenight stand with nikki finke  hes trying to get me fired what do i do  pray for a body switch mixup  so we can see the world from each others perspectives  no you destroy him  with this  i did some research  and unlike what he wrote on his application  bradley never graduated from syracuse  hes four credits shy of a degree in bro studies  you slip this transcript under your managers door  and hes fired  no i cant do that  its wrong  if you dont get him he gets you  and that little snake  keeps slithering up the corporate ladder  instead of a good man like yourself  kenneth sometimes youve gotta get your hands dirty  for the good of company  and country  my two favorite kinds of music  hey everybodys just sitting around in there  waiting for you two to shoot promos  thank god ive got my awesome phil donahue story  pete theres been a development in the whiskey case  what no forget the whiskey  look all i wanted to do was hang with my friends  rock some jams  and tell the story about my cousin seeing phil donahue  i mean me iim the one who saw him  we just wanted to tell you  we dont know what happened to your whiskey  what was that  he doesnt need to know how it went down  it would hurt him too much  i broke the number one rule of being on the force  dont fall in love with your car  no i let it get personal  youre right  the car thing is stupid  the thing is the writers got away with it  so what are we gonna do about it  were goin rogue  hey  sorry about last night  yeah i had to sleep here  you know they turned the heat off  if i hadnt found that other blanket id  wait whered it go  oh god it was mice  the blanket was mice  so what happened with sylvia  you were right liz  lying to my mom was stressing me out  i mean i havent gained weight in months  it wasnt worth it  so what you broke up with lynn   just promise me  here  that youll take care of yourself  dont let liz work you too hard  i do really hate her  i think shes a terrible person  first of all why were you in my bedroom  and why would you tell me that part of the conversation  its the only part where we werent having breakup sex   come on  look im sorry  and i appreciate everything you did so  i made you some meatballs  its my moms recipe   so youre sure youre okay  yeah  definitely with all this behind me  im happy thanks  eat them now  quiet i do the talking  henry  henry warren  henry warrenchang  i married a very bossy chinese lady  what on earth are you doing here   please sit down  thank you  i havent seen you since the 1985 ge talent show  when i convinced you to sing monster mash  knowing full well that jack welch  is terrified of monsters and i ended your career  not ended  doing quite well actually  in publishing now encyclopedias  i wanted to stop by because a young man  named kenneth parcell came to my office this afternoon  he did what did he want  he wanted to find out if my life turned out okay  after you took me down  because hes afraid he might have to do the same thing  to someone else   and what did you tell him  i told him the truth  im great  i lease a certified preowned lexus  both my sons are magicians  and for my birthday  weilin got me tickets to the broadway show memphis  so  and i see that youve done very well for yourself  well that sofa is made from sea biscuit  well were both very impressive  but at what cost jack  the first couple months that we worked together  we were good friends  and then we turned against each other and  come on henry we were never friends  we were pretending so we could learn each others weaknesses  and then exploit them  but what about all the dinners  i mean we talked for hours   i was gathering information  all right  what about the drive up to pittsfield  when we stopped at sturbridge village  remember we had fun  we saw a candle being made  i didnt really care about that candle henry  i dont even remember what color it was  regular whitetan candle color jack  you know what  i really feel sorry for kenneth parcell  because youre gonna beat all thats good out of him  and turn him into another paranoid corporate killer  i remember our trip to hilton head  that wasnt me  take a sit cause no one is going anywhere  we know you all drank petes scotch  so heres how were gonna play it  youre gonna hang out with pete every night this week  why would we do that  cause we have you dead to rights you black bastard  and if you dont play along  we tell pete about your little scam  how the shows been paying for your video games  and nerf rifles and pornography  thats right  we know you ordered a porn version of temple grandin  entitled ten poles rammed in  you ought to be ashamed of yourselves  lets get outta here maroney  the sight of these people plus the crayons i ate earlier  make me sick  sing us a song youre the guitar man  and this is petes birthday night  any mysteries that need solving liz   actually yes  what happened  who attacked you and gave you that haircut  no its these meatballs they dont taste right  theres an extra ingredient  its something familiar  ps i love you is so sad  no one should have to be married  to gerard butler  or hilary swank  its tears  frank was crying when he made these  he lied hes miserable  but i dont understand he seemed so happy earlier  forget it tracy  its midtown  kenneth dont do it  you cant destroy bradley you innocent goon  youre the most remarkable person i know  and ive met jaleel white  incredibly charismatic  he makes stefan urquelle look like steve urkel   but my career  forget about your career  id rather see you get fired and lease a car  than watch you turn into someone like me  now give me that transcript  so youre trying to help me  of course i am kenneth im your friend  its just the other day you said in business  i have no friends  and you were right about bradley  so what does that say about you  maybe youre afraid i will become you  ill climb that corporate ladder  until i eventually take your job  and then where will you be  out on your ass  like stone mountains mailman  riding his trusty donkey erasmus  that is some highlevel paranoid thinking  like hitler or willy wonka  if youre thinking that way  then im already too late  why are you keeping me late to write the cold open   well you know politics  i dont know anything  i get all my news from the radio in grand theft auto  frankie are you okay  la donna di scoregge called and said you were sick  so i came by to make you chicken soup   where can i kill this  wait liz called you   no she called me  you  how dare you get out of my lizs office  you said frank wanted to get back together  why would you tell her that i said i was happy  you lied youre miserable you cried in my food  sylvia your son is not sick  and lynn frank didnt actually say  that he wanted to get back together  so i wore my sexy underwear for nothing  ill kill you  maam i am in a mexican prison gang  you kill me los tiberones will greenlight a 187 on you  and you dont want that kind of heat  sylvia your son is not happy  and not that you care but neither is lynn  thats true when liz called me  i was getting this tattoo  im not creative  and believe me i get it this shouldnt work  i mean how they met is disgusting  their age difference is just weird  they shouldnt go together  but you know what else shouldnt go together  veal fennel lemon cheese and pork  thats right your meatballs  lynn and frank  are just as good as your meatballs  thats it were meatballs  thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard  do you have any idea  what ive been through for love  public humiliation  johnny carson in his monologue said i was looking at 20 years  but id probably be more attracted to 12  i mean thats an okay joke but it hurt  and then prison where we only had one movie  with dabney coleman and the kid from e t   cloak  dagger  shut up liz  i lost my house my life  but it has all been worth it  i mean even if i never see frank again it was worth it  and you call us meatballs  elizabeth  im gonna ask you to leave  okay but if you look at my internet history  im researching a movie about two male centaurs kissing  i was wrong  this isnt creepy because youre dating your teacher  this is creepy because youre dating your mother  you found someone just like me  because im the woman you really wanna be with  cause youre the best  frankie youre the best  my big family  and phil donahues walking past cinnabon  and hes making eye contact with me  i can tell by his smile that hell stay for a while  and say pete youre who i wanna be   well maybe i never did go to college  or travel around the world  so i dont know much about worldly things  like taco meat and having all your fingers  lord knows some of my friends are just shrubs  i put hats on and get high with  my wife had two of the presidents babies  and youre one of em  i can tell you one thing  im gonna kill all yall in yall sleep  now i dont know nothing about no literature or history  but ill tell you what i do know  this movie was written by white nerds  cut
