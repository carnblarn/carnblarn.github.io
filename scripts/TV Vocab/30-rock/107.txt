owner thinks of his dog   kenneth look  no sir  i am using my onceinalifetime interruption  to point out i am not even a dog to you  after all when a dog goes missing  everyones upset cause theres no dog milk  for the babies  jack wants a real negotiation  well i want a piece of the tgs merchandising  the catchphrase this smells  i wrote that  and when 20 cult members  jump off a bridge together

me guess whos who  you must be toofer  im sorry who are you  sighs i was asking myself that same question  and i did not like the answer  so i made a change  im hazel wassername and yes  you may recognize me from one of my two  background acting gigs  dr lingard yesterday  we heard your daughter take full responsibility  for her roles in these crimes  wheres kenneth  he took my spot the suze orman show  groans  what a first day  but you got to roll with the punches  just like my hero ivan drago from rocky iv  this is pathetic  kenneths trying to make us beg him to come back  well we are not doing that  ive learned from having children  that when your kid throws a tantrum and holds his breath  you hold your breath too  when you regain consciousness  believe me hes ready to leave the toy store  finally my client gets 5 gross merchandising  where gross means income before expenses  and not gross like apples on a sandwich  to keep up with deflation  thank obama  and merchandising is a  nonstarter  this meeting is over  when you have a serious offer  email me at tatertotfreakhotmailcom  from now on you can deal with me directly  simon youre fired  where did that come from  are you being coached is it pat riley  tell him the funmeister says hi  hell know what that means  no ones helping me  maybe you just werent giving me enough credit  when you said this was beneath you  surprise  thats what the donaghy method is all about  use my techniques and i dont care  who youre negotiating against  youll win  im negotiating against you  you magnificent bastard  laughs you  charlotte bob is in trouble  this is the part of the movie where i fell asleep  jazz is gonna get you out of this  say hey i am one slick brother  this blows  be the robots from nfl on fox  boo

temporary  i just want all the actors and writers there  to realize how much they miss me  and why should they miss you  well id like to think on some level  were all friends  do you socialize together outside of work  do you exchange gifts  do you vacation together on nonjudgmental cruise lines  well no but  listen girlfriend  youre trying to solve an emotional problem  but what you have is a money problem  you want to be friends with people like  tracy jordan and jenna maroney  theyre rich so show me the money  how much do you make  im not sure  my church requires a 110 tithe   how old are you  dont worry about it  how much have you saved  are you talking about saving squirrels from hawks  zero  if you really want to be friends  with people this  you are going to have to quit the page program  and get a real job so that you can earn for your future  what  no i cant quit the page program  well then denied  you got the initiative how do you keep it  by making a second first impression  youre going to wear dark colors  with a single power accent  every hair in place  hair movement  is a sign of weakness  and whatever you do  dont speak first  by the person who speaks first  because what is speaking a sign of  weakness  you out fired  applause  oh i hate those shoes  oh are we starting please  all right lets start with salary  clicking  what are you doing  laughs oh im sorry  are you on some subconscious level  seeing this as me toying with your manhood  of course i am  i invented that  gasps boca 2002  youve seen the tapes  what no ii just  you are being coached by me  im sorry jack i have to take this  yes may i please speak to pizza  the fake phone call to buy time in an emergency  classic donaghy  okay fine you got me  game over  no no  this just levels the playing field  going mano a mano  against a real adversary me  its the ultimate game  jack donaghy playing with himself  its a jackoff  sarcastically well great job  adam locked himself in the bathroom  if we can get him out of there  you two have got to do better  than that pathetic butchering of whos on first  whos on first  thats the phrase i couldnt remember  whats going on here  i think were waiting  im confused  we make other people wait  forcing people to wait throwing things  making crazy demands and never being satisfied  adams acting like us  but hes not famous  why is the government allowing this  because today hes the star  a jewish star  if we dont make adam happy  his dad is going to tell the irs  my house isnt a church  although i do let children drink wine there  tracy as fellow stars  we may actually be able to solve adams problem  i mean when were acting out  what makes us happy  when im acting out  its never about the real problem  like all actors  im not emotionally mature enough  to deal with my feelings you fartface  i know you are but what am i  adam isnt upset about us  its something else  we just have to find out  what it is and save this bar mitzvah  so youve lost the initiative perhaps by being a woman  or a shorter man  but you can regain it  by fighting on your home turf  no one has ever won a land war in russia  not napoleon not hitler  not even balki in the unaired ninth season  of perfect strangers  so wheres your russia  whats your home turf  the one place in the world where you cannot lose  ice cream store  what are you doing  this is the mens room jenna  not the clist skanks room  thats solid but thats not why were here  adam we want to help  youre the star today  and we know how hard that can be  look we know youre not really mad about us  you acting out is about something else  you can tell us  were in sag  sighs  its just  everyone expects me to dance with a girl today  and i dont know about girls  i mean ive played this japanese video game  where you slap prostitutes to death  but you only ever dance with this penguin  named yamagiku  adam trust me  any girl would want to dance with you  youre rich  and youre fat so youll die young women love that  adrock im going to tell you  the same thing i tell my son  put money in the girls mouth  also my friend darryl is your real father  now you go get em  hazel why does my coffee order  say the black one on it  uh  did you put peanuts on this  yeah its delicious hat guy  ah im allergic  damn it  i have to write a 40word exit evaluation of kenneth  i wish i was dead  grunts  playing the xylophone  okay kenneth you win  please come back  okay when is my birthday  i dont know  when is that party you throw that we never go to  cause we dont know what to get the man who has nothing  suze orman was right  i need to quit the page program and get a real job  you know what we did today  an amazing rendition of whats the guys name  who plays first base  no we solved a problem  by just addressing it head on  tracy  what if you and i dealt with all of our problems that way  what if we were honest at work about whats bothering us  that would make everyones lives a whole lot better  like the polio vaccine  or a nobottom strip club near a wendys  lets do it jmo  hey jack  sorry im so late  youre not  i changed the clock on your phone  i just got here  anyway i really appreciate  you coming to my neighborhood  my home turf if you will  i see  well played jack  you anticipated my counter move  employing a shortness is weakness  power axiom  however i knew that you might know  that i knew to bring my own furniture  so i also brought my jack welch power pillow  im very sorry sir  i thought you might do that  which is why im going to be the first person  to do power quiet talking  forcing you to lean in and wonder if youre missing  any key phrases  whispers like an idiot  i thought youd try power quiet talking  which is why im wearing a hearing aid  stalemate  im everything i hoped id be  lets begin   a show on christmas no gross merchandising  and you have a run in your stocking  two weeks off at christmas   im not wearing stockings  thats a vein  no raise no vacation  and from now on you have to say  go for liz when you answer your phone  um hold on a sec  come on lemon  im just doing the sorcerers apprentice  you respond with a pirate holiday  and i have no choice but to play the hillbilly auction  its all on the tapes  ah forget it this is taking too long  ill do both sides  as jack if you think i wont  do the show without lemon think again  as lizs jack oh jack youre bluffing  liz were out of here  as jack if you walk out that door  youll burn every bridge she has here  itll be back to submitting  topical menopause jokes to joy behar by fax  as lizs jack oh please  youd be in breach  youd have more lawyers on you than a midtown hooker  as jack youre all talk  its like that time you said youd hit on  carla bruni in front of sarkozy  and you totally backed down  as lizs jack so did you  as jack sorry i have to take this  hello  as lizs jack its me nice try  im writing down a number  as jack oh youre dreaming  then id counter id reject that  then an elegante parry with an elegante primo   no that cant be right  elegante elegante primo carry the one  gasps  good god   what  you won  i did  you got everything

message about the goodbye kenneth brunch  i cant tell you how touched  yeah that was a lie but look whos here   double actor announcement  double actor announcement  over the years  weve wasted a lot of time complaining about things  other than whats really bothering us  from now on tracy and i  are going to be more hawnaist  instead of just throwing tantrums  were going to talk things through  whos that lady  its her fault that its cold in here  tracy  be honest  its not about the airconditioning is it  okay  its just that i see a new page  and im not used to change  because i was raised in foster care  applause  sounds like tracys missing someone  hes missing me  boy you are dumb sometimes  tracy this new page is hazel  kenneths replacement  kenneth wants to leave the page program  so he can go make more money  but you need him here dont you  yes i do need you kenneth i depend on you  but im telling you to go  because now that im being honest  this job is a dead end for you  and it would be selfish of me to make you stay  are you serious  yes now go  run kenneth  distorted voice run before i change my mind  groaning  run kenneth  growling run  hey your video says that after a negotiation  the winner should get the loser a gift  so i brought you this popcorn tin  theres no popcorn left  but it makes a great closet organizer  socks underwear bras  i used to be a winner  men wanted to be me women wanted to sleep with me  bisexuals wanted to watch  now look at me  a meaningless job i cant get my wife back  whats the point  maybe ill just quit and  go work for a notforprofit  somewhere where theres less pressure  and the people are nice  and i can wear sneakers and jeans on friday  no jack stop  its okay  i hate myself  i want to be somebody else i want to be a baby again  sobbing  no no no look you won  ill sign whatever  just dont cry daddy doesnt cry  i dont need gross merchandising  sobs  excellent  what what are you doing   proving i could win  god  you were freaking me out  exactly  do you know why i lost earlier  because of our friendship  i want you to have everything  and that made me make a mistake  in other words i lost because of emotion  which i always thought was a weakness  but now ive learned it can also be a weapon  you didnt realize emotion could be a weapon  have you not read the poetry of jewel  the point is  you had lizs jack on your side  and thats why heme beat kabletown jack  until mei turned the tables on youyou  so that means that my mei taught your youyou  a negotiation trick  yes i suppose you did  wow  after six years theres still room  for growth in this friendship  what why are you signing that  you won  lemon i wanted to know i could win  im still going to take care of you  knocking  excuse me sirs  mr donaghy  do you remember the other day when you said  there are other opportunities for me at the company  of course  well i would like to discuss those opportunities  with you further  because i am
