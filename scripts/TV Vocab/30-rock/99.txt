hank as you know  tonight is tgss 100th episode  and weve been getting some good media buzz  got on wikipedia this week  so you did 99 shows against all odds and reason  thats something   now its time to rest  really  you want to cancel the only show on your network  starring a 42yearold woman  a show that is number one in its time slot  among men 18 to 49  months left in prison  i thought this company was a family  but i guess its that austrian family  and i am the girl in the basement  and you are the dad who has been brutally  thank you lemon  what liz is neglecting to tell you  is that tracy jordan is back  oh  well thats something  and i would consider it a personal favor  if you would let them do the 100th episode  and then reevaluate the show with tracy in it  all right  you get one more shot  just like the army doctor said to me  after my weekend in okinawa  you know jack im amazed at how much  you will stick your neck out for your people  its no wonder youre here with us

crazy  he thinks he cant be funny anymore  because nows a big oscar winner  people respect him too much  he told me he feels like a bartrams scrubhairstreak  trying to crawl back into its silky cocoon  which is a butterfly metaphor by the way  and not as i first thought  a list of africanamerican hair pduducts  well you just need to turn the beautiful butterfly  back into  a drunk incompetent caterpillar  and i have a plan  i booked him on every morning show in new york  traci will destroy all his goodwill in time for rehearsal  ive been prepping him all week  so tracy jordan  my wife joey

claws  sharks dont have claws  you dont even know what a shark is anymore  oh god  do you know why  no  liz lemon  lemon  she became your focus  at the expense of your own ambition  you should have realized within a week  that lemon was a black hole  unworthy of our mentorship  and now its five years later and what are you doing  are you building factories in bangalore  are you dining in the palin white house  no  youre approving tgs wrap gifts  baseball caps with stupid sayings from the show  written on them  what the hell is a pwomp  its when two fat people  i dont care  whats happened

real jack donaghy  could handle a little gas leak  i am a jedi  hey look  tracy jordan is ironically reappropriating  his bad past behavior as a commentary  on fitzgeralds dictum that there are no second acts  in american life  i want to take a picture of him  with my oldfashioned camera   no no  ah  help i cant swim  damn it  he just pulled me out of the water and said  dont tell anyone i did this  i didnt even get a chance to congratulate him  on his oscar  modesty and heroism  two words forever synonymous with tracy jordan  tracy jordan saves drowning man  ah come on  why is tracy off rescuing people  why isnt he here  he will be i promise  and we need to be ready  lutz what are you working on  breathing through my mouth  so i dont smell the throwup on s shirt  i would take my shirt off  but i visited my rescue chimp  for his birthday last week  and another chimp got mad and bit my nipple off  he played with it  and then he kissed it  and then he ate it  damn it lutz focus up  wheres my computer  cerie did you not bring my computer down  you said you were writing  ive only seen you use that computer  to look at pictures of nate berkus  ah pwomp  hey jack youre friends  with jeter and springsteen right  can you call and see if theyll be in the cold open  theyd have to kiss  oh really lemon  you still need my help  five years of my business life wasted  and im still supposed to hold your hand  your wet yet somehow flaky hand   what just happened  you happened  sideways jack was right  sideways what  in here  did you also have to evacuate the nbc store  no its just empty  this tv nonsense  was supposed to be my stepping stone  and instead its my gravestone  and do you know whose fault that is  sort of feel like youre gonna say leno  you  i got so sucked into trying to repair you  that i became the american auto industry  failing to recognize that you cant fix a lemon  wow yeah because the last five years  have been so great for me with you as my mentor  i was better off before we met  so whats your point lemon  youd rather be doing the girlie show  and going home to dennis  i didnt say that  but at least dennis was always there for me  hes the only guy i can say that about  i dragged you down  opposite  i should have gone with my gut  and fired you when we first met  what flashback please  uh pete hang back  yeah you bet  we have a problem  i can explain my zipper broke  i dont think liz lemons female voice  is a good match for tracy jordan  firing lemon will send a message to the whole staff  no no you cant fire liz  this show is her life  she hasnt got much going on  she threw a birthday party for her tv  if you fire liz then  then i quit  youll never succeed by sticking your neck out  for someone like her  but if thats how you feel so be it  the important thing is that i fire someone  pete  you tried to fire me  and then a week later youre like  oh i want to mentor you  unlikely friendship  who do you think you are  ill tell you who i was  that guy that fired pete  and he could have run ge  but instead he got lemoned  i should have fired you from my life  i knew you were supposed to push  but i didnt say anything  ugh  mmm  the msg is delicious today  im so glad that youre able to meet me on my break  is this just to talk or will you be activating  my electric underwear  just to talk  paul do you think id be a

spector  oj simpson who texted me earlier today  shoot someone huh  nah thats crazy even for us  i guess it would take a pretty big gas leak  to make you think that was a good idea  all right   minus the commercials    hey dummy  damn it  look liz  if this is gonna work out between you and me  you should know my tarantula sleeps on my face  oh my god  my show is getting cancelled  im never
