a lot of boxes  on my sexual walkabout list  yoko a band  make love to a beloved childrens entertainer  be with a nonaboriginal australian  i thought the whole point of this  was to see if someone could make you happier than paul  i mean if youre just checking off boxes  maybe you should get back together before its too late  whats that supposed to mean  hes not replacing me  were having an adventure  and i hope right now he is also  with a beloved childrens entertainer  maybe raffi  or the sedated prisoner they put inside of barney  something terrible has happened  and for once im not

and cried  i mean it was more like wailing  it was awful  shes referring to my birth  look i know this is a lot to process  so ill leave you two alone to talk  about what  can you believe this is the best room they have  this is supposed to be a hospital  not a japanese internment camp  i volunteered at during the war  well if youre not happy here  i could put you up at the plaza  you could look

has a gay grandson  everybody knows  well then of course id love to have you stay   with me and liddy  liddy  why couldnt you name the baby after my mother  because at ellis island  your mothers name

with me  she already wants to leave my apartment  because liddy is giving her the stink eye  music box plays  as soon as she feels up to it  she is going back to florida  there was no need for us to start jabbering  about our feelings and sobbing  like bill belichick listening to adele  okay fine   but you and your mom  nope  as my coffee cup said this morning  you only regret the things you didnt do  this cup was made from recycled toilet paper  dont let colleen leave without saying what you need to say   last word  damn it  dramatic overture  guitar strumming  im a kangaroo im a

say thanks  id prefer a meat one  yes colleen and i did talk  specifically she said a car was circling the block  casing the house  i tried to explain that those were all different taxi cabs  and she said then why is the same man driving all of them  and insisted on leaving  she wont go to a hotel  and she hates the princeton club  because dean cain is always there  hoping to get recognized  i tried to leave her at the bodies exhibit  god that is all just a smoke screen  shes acting out because she wants to have the conversation  and you wont meet her halfway  i decided something last night  after i got your tenth text message  one of which was an inscrutable emoticon  hold it sideways  its me going like this  talk to your mother  the 8 is my glasses  yes someday my mother is going to

married in jean shorts in provincetown  while im just trying to enjoy an ice cream on the pier  okay fine if i cant convince you  maybe youll listen to the words of mike and the mechanics  whose song
