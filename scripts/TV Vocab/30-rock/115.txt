what a world  i bet even hillary clinton has to put up with this crap  from whoever was secretary of state before her   you mean condoleezza  shut up  look i believe in hazel i happen to be her mentor  so to quote mr miyagi  leave girl alone or you deal with me surf shop owner   hey sweetie how was your day   not even half over hazel  ugh i still have to read all these essays  okay  look at you

bedroom tip  put a bag of popcorn in the microwave beforehand  that way when youre done you have a treat   i wish i had your emotional intelligence  my boyfriend razmig and i have hit a little rough patch   okay lay it on me   well i went home this afternoon to get some  and i found razmig banging the fattest chick ive ever seen  and you know i used to weigh 800 pounds   stop right there  you didnt hit a rough patch he cheated on you  you have to dump him immediately   what how can you say that   hazel im trying to help you   by asking me to break up with the man i love  helping me would be teaching me how to spice things up  like by greeting him at the front door  wearing nothing but false teeth  im very disappointed in your mentorship liz  if this were two years ago  i would sit on you till you died   no wigs  i said no wigs  youre not a lead gabe  at best youre a featured extra with no lines  do you understand  hey gabe   lemon would you be interested in writing the screenplay

im fasttracking the project  the script is due on monday  monday  hmm i guess i wont be able to go to the gym this weekend   i know its short notice  but i would consider it a personal favor  after six years of listening to you complain  about how there are so few women on death row   is a coincidence or is the system sexist  oh speaking of our amazing dynamic  i have taken on a mentee of my own jack  a page named hazel   youre a mentor  but that makes me a grandmentor  and im still so young  dont worry  i already messed it up  i told her to break up with her awful boyfriend  and she got really mad at me   often the best way for a mentee to learn  is for you to let her fail   wait does that mean youve done that to me  when  um   i think the crowd at the apollo  might welcome a change of pace   youre right you should do it  sometimes they have to learn the hard way  if hazel rejects your advice let her  shell get there on her own  just like you did after the crowd at the apollo  chased you into the river   okay i understand the irony of what im about to say  but i reject that advice  dont worry ill bring you back a tshirt from successtown  ow my groin   mr jordan  kdog  you
