                1 i finished my kabletown self evaluation  nailed it  my greatest weakness is humility  im probably the most humble person in the whole world  i wrote that  these selfevaluations are a charade  people cannot be impartial about themselves  you should read what some of your coworkers wrote  what three words best describe me  the complete package  my greatest weakness is chocolate  surprisingly the only person who was honest was jenna  strengths none  i am the worst person i know  when i used to live with liz i would videotape her sleeping  and sell it to japanese businessmen  no wonder that tour group kept calling me sleep whoresan  oh no no no no no  dont read that  i filled it out last night  after mixing alcohol with prescription exhaustion  i need to redo it  i cant believe i have to read all of these  this is the biggest waste of time  since nbcs diversity writing program  that was a good idea but all of our actors are so white  slap it to me daddyo  popo popped dookie down by the vacants  exciting jazz music    s06 ep16  nothing left to lose   phone vibrates  this is jenna what are you wearing  british accent jenna love  its english director christopher nolan  mr nolan i saw you across the room  at the dark knight premiere  i was shooting blow darts at maggie gyllenhal from a heating vent  yes how would you like to be in my next movie  i quit this show  to hell with you all  go to hell  i just need you to do a quick camera test for me  i do not understand christopher nolans methods  hes directing a liveaction smurfs sequel  so i went to times square did cartwheels like he asked  oh boy  we got the whole thing on tape  this was a prank  this isnt body paint  its a spray they use to kill geese at airports  what happened jmo  did you pass out in a goose costume at laguardia  all laugh  ugh what is that smell tracy  its the new fragrance i designed  its called desire  but with a z instead of the second e  what is that supposed to smell like  all my favorite things  the knicks a mop from a strip club a carefree hobo  a crate with a new giraffe in it and broccoli  it smells disgusting  yeah i wouldnt know  i lost my sense of smell years ago  but when one sense goes away the others make up for it  i have an incredible sense of touch  i feel an old jackolantern from last halloween  are you serious  you cant smell  why havent you been to a doctor  who has the time  with work family and hobbies and listing excuses  inhales deeply  oh my  it smells like grandmas house at christmas  thats when we found her dead on the toilet  pete i spent the morning going over  these kabletown selfevaluations  your evaluation gave me pause  are you sure  those look like hands to me  heres the problem  in answer to the question  where do you see yourself in five years  you wrote right where i am  thats an unacceptable answer  i mean what if the wright brothers had said  lets just keep making bicycles  or alexander windowblinds had said  no i dont want to partially see outside  yeah no i get what youre saying  but im pete hornberger  the last time i tried to put myself out there  the girl turned out to be a cop  do you understand how this attitude reflects on me  i am also required to complete  one of these inane selfevaluations  its a farce  what like frasier  but thats fun  but i cant say im succeeding as a manager  if youre failing as an employee  you have no ambition pete  no no you dont understand  for me that five years thing is very ambitious  look at my life jack  my father was a congressman  i was valedictorian at st andrews  an olympic archer fourth guitarist in loverboy  as a teenager  its almost unbelievable  if it werent all true  id say it doesnt even make sense  but now look at me  the last two decades have been a freefall  if i could stay in the same place for the next five years  that would be a huge accomplishment  do you know who you remind me of  george w bush  during his lets do coke and buy the texas rangers phase  but he made a decision to be the best president ever  and then he was  youve lost your mojo pete  and im going to get it back for you  well something is definitely obstructing your sinus cavity  now we have two options  i can either drill a hole in the back of your head  and push it out with your brain  okay that sounds good  or i could just pull it out through your nostril  well do the second one thank you  you know they dont tell you this until after youve paid  for medical school but being a doctor  is exactly like the game operation  and there we go  my buck rogers decoder ring  how long has that been in there  those things are from the 70s  yeah you know what else is from the 70s  women staying quiet  i totally remember this  when i was nine i found it on the floor of the g train  i knew if my foster mom saw it she would make me sell it  at a pawn shop to get our family a cheerio  okay sometimes i think the stories  of your childhood poverty are exaggerated but continue  so i hid the ring up my nose  i must have forgot about it  you may feel some burning and tingling  but you should regain normal sensation in just a few hours  oh im sorry i was talking to my lover on my bluetooth  uh one moment suki  anyway tracy you should start  regaining sensation in less than an hour  but a newly regained sense can be a very powerful thing  even overwhelming  so if you do have an extreme reaction  please try to get it on video for my nephews funny website  uh liz are you getting enough vitamin c  chuckles  may i suggest messily eating an orange while i photograph it  knocks on door  kenneth what do you know about revenge  well the bible says its wrong  but its the surprise hit of the season on abc  so i dont know  anyway i know how

sniffs  i memorized all my lines so can i go  get dressed for the photo shoot now  so you dont have to wait for me  sure little buddy  you know smell is the sense  most closely associated with memory  i know dotcom thats why whenever i smell that jacket  i remember being bored  the only person youre insulting  with that attitude is yourself  obviously something about the way i smell  reminds tracy of his dad  well his father did work for a soup factory  and you are constantly eating  its not a food thing grizz  i think its my hair pomade  midnight symphony  my grandfather used that  midnight symphony  you are the conductor of your own proud african orchestra  midnight symphony   you use midnight symphony  it works dotcom  it was discontinued a few years ago but i bought seven cases  of it

you have people like jack donaghy vladimir putin  orville redenbacher  corn is not the only thing he popped  if you know what i mean  then  you have the other end of the spectrum  yeah i get it  men with no confidence  no men who have nothing left to lose  great men like richard nixon the 1980 olympic hockey team  my good friend john rambo  this is you  and i shouldnt have been trying to get you  all the way to the tiger  because all you needed was a little push  to get you to nothing left to lose  this is how you get your mojo back pete  no i am there jack  my job is killing me my family resents me  the other day i was mugged by what im pretty sure  was two fiveyearolds in a trench coat  i already have nothing left to lose  no you have one more thing  gasps no not the ring  youre clinging to something thats gone pete  and its not coming back  allow yourself to be reborn  your life is tied to the fate of the ring  it must be destroyed  are you quoting lord of the rings  no im

know why  well he is estranged from his son  kellan lutz from twilight  im sorry are you asking me to apologize to him  look yeah we mess with people  but theres a line we dont cross  for example after you went through our trash  we went through yours  and we found this  my selfevaluation  i want to be famous to make people love me  because i hate myself  the jenna i talk to at night in the mirror  thinks i should kill myself  also i caused that italian cruise ship to crash  we could do a lot of damage with this  but were not going to  whatever  hey  hows my boy  working hard  so hard

accomplished  yeah hes a mess  but petes just an excuse  the fact is i cant fill this out  because theres a question i dont know how to answer  where do you see yourself in five years  for the first time in my career i dont know  i could wind up anywhere  running this company making couches  serving as mayor of new york  or i could be 6 feet under  in the subterranean paradise we built to escape the poor  yeah i get it  as a writer that uncertainty is the fate  that always i am to face being  well im not used to it  but thats not petes problem its mine  you go talk to tracy  and i have to stop pete from shaving his head  oh god  so lutz  you thought i left you off the hook the other day  well you wish  i spent the whole night going through the garbage  trying to find the perfect thing
