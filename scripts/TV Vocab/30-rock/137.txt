make shows that people actually want to watch  shows where a guy gets a drink thrown in his face  and then he turns to his dog and says  dont even say it  to his dog  okay well i think tv can be successful  without sacrificing quality  there it is  okay well if thats what you want  maybe i shouldnt bring my ideas to nbc  ill go to cable where you can swear  and really take time to let moments

should have been the greatest moment of my life  no no no no no eyes off the window  focus on lemon what am i gonna do now  i could try and help you make some calls  and see what bridges i havent burned  but im not going to  for your own good  work is never going to make you happy lemon  and anyone who tells you differently is a fool  are you kidding me  what have we been talking about for the last seven years  i dont know anymore  for the first time in my life i dont know what i need  maybe ill buy a boat  my god  this whole time youve been telling me how to run my life  you didnt know what you were talking about  youre just an alcoholic with a great voice  careful lemon youre playing with fire  you made me buy into this whole life  when i met you i was perfectly happy with what i had  eating night cheese and transitioning my pajamas  into daywear  youre the one who told me to want more  and now when i need you most youre bailing on me  youre an adult lemon you didnt have to listen to me  really when was that an option  look if you want someone to blame blame yourself  youre the one who wormed your way into my brain  with your endless handwringing and feelings  i used to be a shark and then you unsharkulated me  i called you up here for one meeting seven years ago  and you kept coming up  so we ruined each other  good to know  you know its for the best that my show is over  and youve quit  and were all going our separate ways  i guess you and i were just a boss and his employee  and now were not anymore  yes that pretty much sums it up  there  youre no longer special to him  get out get out of our lives  yes  could you help on that pete  this last episode is gonna be a hot mess   how so  if tgs doesnt do  one more show tracy gets 30 million  nbc the same company that suggested  we get flush buddies to save water  liz tracy has landed  of course he has because if he didnt  hed be in breach of contract and wouldnt get the money  which means hes gonna try to find another way  to ruin the show  seven years and tracy never changed  well people are who they are liz  this is dan silversmith  with carolina mutual  i cant talk right now im with a customer  well whatever sideways nonsense  tracy tries to pull im gonna hold him down  im gonna hold him down like that machine  kathy geiss invented that hugs old people  my god this will change

sometime  and were all gonna stay friends  sorry is that the white ladys way  of saying im going out to get cigarettes  cause that goodbye was atrocious  fine well i guess theres a reason  people dont say honest goodbyes  because when stuff is coming to an end  people freak out and they act crazy  they pick fights and they pick blimpies  and i dont know what petes doing  so you lie to them  but if you want a hardcore truth goodbye  lay it on me  okay  we were forced to be friends because of work  and were probably not gonna hang out after this all right  youll say that youre gonna invite me to your house  and its never gonna happen  and ill see on tv that its your birthday  d ill forget to call and ill see on tv that its your birthday  and working with you is hard  tracy you frustrated me

blimpies  cerie you heard the man  blimpies  i was thinking about what you said earlier  how people get sloppy when they fake their own deaths   you said that  the trick is  to wait for the right moment  a day when it makes sense to have a drink or two  i dont know maybe a sad occasion  when somethings coming to an end  you let people see you with the glass in your hand  that way after the crash theyll be like  i did see him drinking  god that idiot what did he do  yeah thats what theyll say  no no no no no  dont worry lemon  there is no cause for alarm  you are watching my video suicide note  my god  try not to blame yourself  how were you to know that i was in such a dark place  that the smallest thing  for example a close friends refusal to reconcile  would be the final straw  he killed himself because of me  this is like what happened with my gynecologist  all over again  i do have a parting gift for you lemon  his phone i can track his phone  go to youtube and

soulcrushing horror of a life without me  i didnt lie when i said i was going away  im off to discover what makes me happy  i have to find my bliss  which for once is not an acronym  for beautiful ladies in short shorts  how long will you be gone  as long as it takes to figure out whats next  although ive only been on this boat a minute  ive already realized two things about myself  one  i could totally be a professional boat model  and two i do know one thing that has made my happy  these last seven years  lemon there is a word a once special word  thats been tragically coopted  by the romance industrial complex  and i would hate to use it here  and have you think that i am suggesting  any kind of romantic sentiment  let alone an invitation to scale bone mountain  its a word that comes to us  by way of the old high german luba  from the latin lubere  meaning to be pleasing  so i am going to use this word to describe  how i feel about you  in the way that our anglosaxon forefathers  would have used it in reference to say  a hot bowl of bear meat  or your enemys skull split  i love you too jack  thank you america thats our show  not a lot of people watched it  but the jokes on you cause we got paid anyway  ladies and gentlemen jenna maroney  this is just the start lemon  imagine the insights  months on this boat will yield  the next time you see me  ill be a new
