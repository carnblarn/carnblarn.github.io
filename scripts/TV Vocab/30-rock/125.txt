parties  why is everyone asking me for advice  im tracy jordan  father of 3 married 22 years  i run my own business  oh my god im the most stable adult here  oh god i dont want to be jennas maid of honor  she wants her something borrowed  to be jessica biels youth  i dont know how to get that  if you dont want to do this you should tank it  thats what i do when i want to get out of something  like a schedule a parentteacher conference  or this boring conversation  tank it wow no  thats not how i roll  thank you for saying that in dated urban slang  so that ill understand you  word  and i would certainly never tank on my friend jenna  because youre terrified of her  the way most white ladies are with their best friends  that is racist and only part true  a good person doesnt intentionally do a bad job  i mean look at jack  hes in this terrible position at work  he wishes he were somewhere else  is he tanking it  no in fact hes trying even harder  tonight on nbc joe rogan is mandela  and if its wednesday it must be cricket night in america  then on jay a full hour of gary sinises band  oh my god jacks tanking nbc  turn your round god cop scene 24  i know what youre doing jack  you are purposely tanking the network  good god lemon what is it  with you liberals and your conspiracy theories  ive got bad news for you  the cia did not invent crack cocaine  the levees blew themselves up in new orleans  and no one is trying to destroy nbc  hang on did you cast yourself in this show  what can i say  we saw hundreds of actors for god  finally the network executive said i should just play it  youre the network executive  uh could we have a moment please  fine you got me  im steering the titanic into the iceberg  why are you trying to get fired  im trying to get hank to sell the network  and the only way to make him do that  is to turn it into a moneylosing embarrassment  gasps this explains everything  how long has this been going on  seven years eight  six weeks  i have an investor lined up  wholl buy the network and keep me in charge  i cant tell you who it is  but his word is as good  as the color consistency on one of his easter eggs  adolph paas  this is wrong jack  lemon i cannot go to another business school reunion  and sit at the nonceo table with the  women and nice men  youre right lemon the clock is ticking for both of us  but if i pull this off its good for you too  youve never worked at a properlymanaged company before  thats true  before this i ran an allwomens theater company   everyone was vicepresident  think of the job stability  less stress a commissary that has taco tuesdays again  after seven years youll finally have a life  and what if your plan doesnt work  of course its a risk  but sometimes your only choice is to blow everything up  and build something better out of the rubble  look at shermans march to the sea  or what my good friend bane tried to do to gotham  join me lemon  help me tank nbc  never youre playing with peoples lives here  who do you think you are  god were ready for you  if there is one thing i have realized from being god  its that the more you know  the more you realize you do

will be your maid of honor  because theres only one person who can be  you   what thats crazy  think about it  there would be nobody to steal your spotlight  in fact you would have two spotlights  i think the maid of honor should sing at my wedding  sure  and she could do a fashion show that takes the audience  all the way through the wedding night  and what if she came in in a wheelchair  and then stood up and everyone applauded and cried  i know you doubted me but now you see my plan could work  so what do you say  are you on board liz  you just called me liz  oh we can fix that in the cutting room  uh jonathan  wheres my car  kenneth i have something i need to tell you  last night when you left hazel came on to me  cause she wants me to put her in a movie  hazel is this true  yeah

believe here   my best friend  not really   and my girlfriend  you wish  well i always believe you sir  because youre on television  and webisodes  but yesterday you told me our women are queens  and theyre always right  which means i should believe hazel  but that would make you wrong mr jordan  and youve never been wrong about anything before  its a blessing and a purse  you cant both be right  unless hazel is always right  but only because you said so mr jordan  which means youre right too  and both sides being right is like kissing your sister  a wonderful treat  laughs  bad move jordan  well see whos still working here in six months  my hearing is bad because of firecrackers  but well see whos still working here in six months   thats what i just said  what  okay i get it  sometimes tanking it is the only option  what did you do  fake a sprained ankle to get out of that breast health 5k  no i did that  i forgot my sports bra so ironically  uh it doesnt matter lemon  im just glad
