the midnineties  you havent had sex  elisa had a very strict very religious upbringing  she does not take that step lightly  we have of course   pleasured one another  no stop i believe  but she wants me to make some kind of commitment before we go forward  obviously i care about her a lot but she keeps confusing me   with this ridiculous notion that sex and love are somehow connected  ok two

this magnificent woman  and there is no amount of money this company could lose that would cause me to  yes thats the amount ill get dressed right now  bill hewitt undersecretary of the treasury  what advice can you give our viewers in these uncertain times  the worst thing you could do in a time like this is to pull out  your investments dont panic because i think that  devils avocado here larry i think people should freak the geek out   withdraw all your money and hide it  interesting strategy  its what ive always done i hide cash everywhere  at home at church even at work  in fact ive hidden so much money that if some of it was gone  id probably wouldnt even notice   now why would you say that  i dont know  dont worry miss lemon ill protect you  ah its just kids  what is going on with people  they took my wallet   was this your nana lemon  yeah shes the one were doing this for   shes dead come on  wait why is she wearing these glasses  this is from new years but you said she died on your birthday  and thats in november  no thats not a new years thing thats the year she wanted to live to   and she didnt make it  sing that lullaby again   hast du etwas zeit fr mich    dann singe ich ein lied fr dich   keep going   von 99 luftballons   i knew it thats 99 red balloons nenas famous antiballoon protest song   you lied to me  yeah alright i lied so what  you want the truth kenneth you want the truth  i cant handle the truth  theres an adult picture of me on that phone  adult you mean like youre driving a car or wearing a suit  its a boobies picture kenneth   and i only kept it because for once they were both pointing in the same direction  i knew you wouldnt help me if i told you the truth  so you lied to me  thats not something that friends do to each other  then maybe

vice president jack donaghy  jack whats your outlook on all of this  i just wanna preach caution larry  if there was anything to worry about i would be at my office  instead of at home right now with

hang up hang up on him larry  im going to but not because you told me  lincoln nebraska you are on the air  so is this what youd rather be doing than spending time with me   it smells like dude in
