with only one option  explain to me why smooth move ferguson is funny  well while you were away we ordered mexican food  and the delivery guy tripped  and then mister griswald said smooth move ferguson  that story is not funny  sir you had to be there  then i will be  we are going to recreate all the events  surrounding smooth move ferguson  exactly as they occurred  maybe then we can get on with our lives  lets get to work  jonathan what is going on  sir you need to see this  even if it ruins whatever you had planned  for secretarys day like a poem you wrote for me  or whatever  we go now to a pretaped statement  from supercrazy korean dictator kim jongil  people of north korea  it is your dear leader kim jongil  worlds greatest golfer and movie director  and best man at tom bradys wedding  as we all know  the decadent western journalist spy laura ling  left us because she cant party as hard as we can   i know right  i know right  but now another american reporter  has come to north korea because its awesome  and we have enough food  avery jessup  her name is avery jessup and like me  her hair is blonde  one of our own nbcs avery jessup donaghy  detained in north korea

yourself  its not just about a bag or a view  its about taking charge of your life  and solving problems  im facing a similar situation myself  lay it on me twoway street  avery has been kidnapped by kim jongil  what why is she a spy  oh my god i already know too much  kim jongil runs a vast propaganda machine  evidently his latest insane idea  is to bring in a western journalist  to report on how the free world  is being conquered by north korea  and in food news youve had enough to eat today  now here with the weather is johnny mountain  north korea everything sunny all the time  always goodtime beach party  back to you avery  you have to call president clinton  he got lisa lings sister out of north korea  president interbush is out of the question  avery will never accept his help  she cant forgive him for not hitting on her  during the 1996 democratic convention   shes much too thin  i do of course  still have some connections but my best bet is fraught  i never should have broken up with condi via text message  you broke up with condoleezza rice by text  me plus you equals frowny face   yeah you cant call her  i know  but i am going to solve this  just like you are going to solve your equally important  bag in a tree situation  invictus lemon  now that ive killed that bug  id like to call this smooth move ferguson  recreation meeting to order  kenneth report  well sir weve got the delivery guy booked  but ive run into some big problems  for example it was raining that day  get a rain machine  look here take my credit card  use it to break into a special effects warehouse  to steal one  well sir even if we did that  there are some things we cant control  we dont remember what we were wearing  dotcom was sick  security footage  dotcom licks the subway steps  these are solvable problems  well what about this  miss maroney was here screaming at mr rossitano  later that day she got her hair cut  aw thank you  the point is her hair was longer then  jmo how long would it take for your hair to grow back  it depends do you have access to horse semen   you know i do  give me three weeks  then well reconvene in three weeks  meeting is adjourned  oh my god what happened to my bug  stupid grappling hook  cant catch one little bag  you think im giving up  did i give up when that squirrel  i trained to retrieve you just ran away  you will not win mr bag  but liz i already have  what did you say  jacks wrong  no human is truly the master of his fate  even your dream apartment cant protect you from death  im not ruining your view  im reminding you of your mortality  cause you know ill be here long after youre gone  the wind rustling against my genitals  thats right bags have genitals  you dont know me  go ahead buy nesting tables  paint an accent wall  ill watch the emts take you out in my cousin  a body bag  k9 operation ferguson status report  rain check room temperature check  miss maroneys hair length check  do you like it  if you say no ill drown myself  mr griswald could you put the tv  on the right channel msnbc  was dotcom standing that gay  no sir he was not  today denying reports that jessup donaghy  is anchoring a fake western news channel  calling the accusations quote  as ridiculous as the dunk kim jongil won  the nba dunk contest with  hey whats my boy kj doing on tv  what thats kim jongil  yeah we did a movie together  that he directed and costarred in  death to the cia  let us all increase production of millet and sunflowers  i defuse bomb black partner  hasta la vista baby  dude i think you did a north

laugh  now you sons of bitches  tracy its come to my attention  that you know kim jongil  and obviously im concerned about my wife  and i want to know what shes going through  please hold nothing back  okay but you might not like what i have to tell you  kim jongil sometimes shoots in a closeup too much  comedy lives in a wide shot  and also this is gonna be rough  his acting notes are often vague  okay thank you  what is this  my god  theyre letting her speak  for the past three weeks i have been honored to partake  in a political reeducation regimen  i have voluntarily taken several floggings  for being an arrogant american  thats okay shes tough  we do a lot of piratethemed sexual role playing  im a parrot  also i spend eight hours a day  breaking concrete blocks  to learn to be an obedient worker  no problem she pays 1000 an hour  to do that with a trainer  and i have concluded that capitalism may be flawed  my god  what are those monsters doing to her  doctor rice  well look
