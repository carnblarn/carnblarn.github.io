there any news about tracy  as of this morning he was still  saving lives in africa  im doing gods work here in africa  why just yesterday  i kicked two naked people out of a garden   but tracy we need you here  simba rafiki  click click click yeah thats right  i just put you in your place in african  tgs with tracy jordan without tracy jordan  is an oxymoron like liberal government  or female scientist  or princeton football  we were 4 and 3 in ivy league play last year  our quarterback henry chang  it doesnt matter the point is  that without tracy tgs is going on  a forced hiatus  forced hiatus okay  so what should i tell the troops  its simple sit them down individually  tell them the network still supports the show  and that this is temporary  but youre lookin out for us right  pounding on desks and  doing whatever this is called  power wagging and im doing what i can  but i spent a lot of political capital  buying a new network for kabletown  is it tnt are rizzoli and isles  friends in real life  its a small cable network  targeted towards gay male viewers  its called twinks  thats the name of your network  isnt twink a term  for a young hairless gay man  nonsense twinks is an acronym  designed to project a positive gay image  twinks television with individuals  naive kinky shaved okay  if the network were thriving it would be one thing  but my programming has yet to find its footing  uck no  next  boring who  twinks could be extremely lucrative  advertisers covet this demographic  when i was with dfwan on queen of jordan  he spent 4000 on chihuahua outfits  whispers for himself  okay well dont worry about tgs  ill take care of this hiatus thing myself  thank you lemon id like to help  but im afraid my hands are tied  is the only show anyones watching on twinks  exciting jazz music   the important thing is this forced hiatus is only temporary  well be back before you know it  sidney its frank tgs is dead  start booking me standup gigs  how many black womens colleges are there in the country   what are you doing  you just said  were going on a forced hiatus  i know what that means time for plan b  harriet tubman school of nursing  yes and yes  well

know this is temporary  of course it is  cause im gonna find a way to save the show  let me just take out my idea journal  hmm  this just says bird internet  he said forced hiatus  oh man   thats bad  simon youre my agent  youre not supposed to panic youre supposed to help me  like how fredward helps out icarly  no listen everyone here has a plan b  if theres a real chance that tgs could go away  what is my backup  maybe something with vampires  cause everything has vampires nowadays  have you seen the twilight movies or vampires diaries  im not allowed to  you need to get me some meetings  would you be willing to come in  for an alpo commercial  if you can get through the audition without pooping  its yours  im a human writer simon find me a writing job  so jack hows the baby  baby ah yes  baby blackasian bisexual youths  those are viewers we want  and twinks is gonna bring them in  its not a business question jack  i mean your baby   your daughter  oh laughs  of course uh liddy she is adorable  my night nurse swears she calls me koskel  which in trinidadian creole means stranger  dont let work be everything jack  familys just as important  as fixing that fellas that like fellas network  you talked me into buying   im on top of that  are you  jack theres lots of things i like  fishing marches by john philip sousa  telephones that look like footballs  but theres one thing i dont like  losing money  now i dont know if my tone is conveying  the fury i feel about this  but i am pardon my french  bonjour  laughing  now thats a joke but i am really really mad  look hank im already working on fixing twinks  im remaking knight rider with the oscar meyer wienermobile  its okay jack  you made a bad decision and bought something  you didnt understand  like when i bought tickets for black swan  remember when a movie was just a fellow with a hat  runnin away from a fellow with no hair   no  the point is  you failed  but unless theres a gay jack donaghy  locked up somewhere who understands all this stuff  lets just chalk this one up to never again  and enjoy our lunch  hank  there is a gay jack donaghy  his name is devin banks  man are you okay  i sense something  a presence ive not felt since  lemon  i decided to hire   devin banks  banks but hes your nemesis  that would be like me hiring that mouse  that keeps pooping in my slippers  devin is the perfect man to fix twinks  hes a gay shark like the actor who played jaws  but hes gonna come in and try to ruin everything  and everything is already ruining itself  not this time  banks put all of his eggs in the obama basket  when the administration started to falter  because of our conspiracy  i mean obamas ineptitude  he tried to distance himself publicly from uh  your president  the recession were emerging from  was primarily caused by lack of responsibility  and accountability  then he tried to rejoin us capitalists  showed up at john paulsons sweet 16 billion party  nobody would talk to him not even ira  then he was all oh ill just look at these books  then pretended to get a text and left  and we were all like whatever well go to ihop  and not tell him snickers   where is he now  i tracked him down  to an address in brooklyn  hes on linkedin lemon  laughing he might as well be dead  so i throw him a lifeline  and he comes crawling back like a uh  crab i guess  what else crawls lemon  babies jack you have one  hank hooper is a traditionalist  he had his first heart attack  when he saw pineapple on a pizza  hell hate banks and his hairless nostrils  and men should have nose hairs  hooper will hate devin  and hell never be able to go over your head  exactly ill pay him for his ideas and uh  kick him out the door  speaking of tv ideas  would you buy a show about a girl television writer  trying to have it all in the city  and also shes a vampire i guess  i like the end part  lemon why do you have a blank note pad  with plan b written on it  because im freaking out  i told everyone about the forced hiatus  wait you said forced hiatus  yeah i didnt know it was code for canceled  i thought we understood each other  i thought we understood  that you are never to think that i understand anything  and you have no plan b  ive been telling you to prepare for the end of tgs  for the last two years  well there have been a lot amazing races on since then  and i had to watch them and go online and comment on them  here are your options you can go to la  groans ive been to la once  olive just turns into barham   justice for rodney king  how do i get to 10  sirens blaring its the 10  rodney king  you cant afford to be selective  opportunities for writers are fewer and farther between  what about opportunities for storytellers  beginning with the cave paintings of lascaux mankind   i can get you a meeting with nick lachey for the singoff  ill take it   you here for the singoff gig  yeah  do i know you  you know my work walk with me  im

other on facebook  what is poking anyway why wont anybody do it to me  im cool  so its really that bad out there  i mean youre aaron sorkin  speaking og angry birds xdo you know how to beat 114  its just a red guy and a green guy  the key is do not use the green guy as a boomerang   did we just go in a circle  listen lady  a gender i write extremely well if the story calls for it  this is serious  we make horse buggies  and the first model  just rolled into town   were dinosaurs  we dont need two metaphors  thats bad writing not that it matters  mr sorkin mr lachey will see you now  mr lachey huge fan  huge fan i have all your albums  sighs  oh youll be proud of me miss lemon  it is not easy coming up with ideas to save the show  but this morning i held up this sign  in the today show window  now im just waitin for the phone to ring  kenneth you may not be able to save the show  if you wanna save this dumb show  you gotta get the fans involved  you know like sometimes people mail stuff to networks  to show how passionate they are  they sent light bulbs to save friday night lights  hot sauce to save roswell  and douche bags to save entourage  okay so we just need to think of something  that fans can send to hank hooper that says tgs  something like  bird internet  door opens its about time cashmere  itsy bitsy spider plays did you find chanas boppy  was it at hoarsely music adventures  banks whats become of you  nothing  itsy bitsy spider stops  these arent babies theyre organ farms  dont look at me  chuckles devin  explain the gaybies  im a househusband now happy  i married a shiny black dancer named cashmere  and we mixed our sperm together  so no one would know whose baby is whose  now have you had your fun looking at the freak  im here to offer an olive branch  im working with kabletown now  and weve acquired a network called twinks  i could use someone on it fulltime a subordinate  laughing  you came all the way out here to brooklyn  to offer me banks a job  you must be desperate jack  twinks must be exploding and not in a good way  you thought that i would lick your boots  but you need me  so now im gonna make you let me lick your boots  ill keep you on a very tight leash   fantastic continue  i will not  gay set you up again so ill be very clear  youll be under me  and if theres one slipup your ass is mine  you couldnt resist coming to see how far id fallen  but that was your mistake  down came the rain and washed the spider out  no you are the spider i am the sun  i dry up all the rain  yes freeing me the spider to climb up the spout again  whispers you bastard  now who wants some numnums  hey simon whats up  any word from the singoff  its a pass  but lachey hated you   so what now  under breath youre fired   what  mumbles youre fired  are you dropping me as a client  what am i gonna do  jack cant help me you dont want me as a client  i have no other skills  liz im gonna tell you what i tell my dog clients  when i drop them chuh chuh  chuh chuh chuh   simon  chuh  chuh chuh  jack weve been waiting almost an hour  for this banks fellow  the only explanation i can think of  is that he keeps stopping to perform good deeds  no hes pulling a power play right out of the gate  hes making us wait  so it looks like i have no authority over him  laughs well im a straight shooter jack  except at the urinal but thats just a little  shrapnel side effect from vietnam  so when it comes to business  chuckling i dont like these kinds of games  boy i hope my tone is conveying how annoyed i am  you should be annoyed hank of course  devins crude attempts at manipulation  dont work with a man like you  banks is not a straight shooter like you and me  for now we need him  but as soon as he stops being useful  we throw him in a ditch  my apologies gentlemen  i tried to call  but somebody spilled milky all over daddys phoney  didnt you little mykonos  together you brought a baby to a business meeting  im so sorry but this little guys really sick  he threw up all over my jacket  and i just couldnt leave him but  of course i didnt want to miss this fabulous opportunity  im always just trying to balance work and family  its kinda what im all about  well son youre gonna do great here at kabletown  damn it  you know one of my grandchildren  is just about the same age as mike here   we should set up a playdate  hows tomorrow  uh hank could devin and i just have a moment please  of course  ill just entertain this little bundle of joy  with one of my uncle hank stories  the vc was everywhere  yes they were yes they were  this is a new low even for you banks  using your own baby to get in with hooper  i brought the sexiest one too  his cheekbones are like granite  and old hank the family man fell right into my trap  this isnt even baby vomit on my jacket  its mine all mine  this is not over  oh look how much he just loves his uncle hank  whoosh went the flamethrower  medic medic cried the wittle boy  both chuckling  oh how was substitute teaching sir  oh just like lean on me in that a guy  who looks like morgan freeman swung a bat at me  what are you doing with those sugar cubes  starting a fan mailing campaign to save the show  people will send sugar cubes to hank hooper  to show that theyre sweet on tgs  ive already sent about  even though licking an envelope is a sin  unless youre married to it  so i had to marry each envelope and then divorce it  which brings me to my ninth point  so youre putting a sugar cube in an envelope  and then mailing it to hank hooper  but then when he opens it  it will have been crushed  into a fine white powder  i suppose so sir  kenneth do you know what anthrax looks like  im not with him  god bless america  aah  my thorax  we never could have found him so quickly  without your help  thank you mentaalist  it is a gift and a curse  in the tv show  you bang me in a tulip field under credits  mommy  whats that  its a toilet  or woman its whatever you need it to be  no people of the sidewalk  we cant give up on the written word  we need stories  because i dont have a plan b  i have a degree in theater tech with a minor in movement  why did my parents let me do that  its over  whos there show yourselves  youre one of us now  cat screeches  gasps who are you  better to ask who we used to be  people whose professions are no longer a thing

playdate with the hoopers  oh it was amazing  he has really superlative tummytime  oh i almost forgot  hank uncle hank wants to expand overseas  and hes chosen me to be the face of the company in europe  thats right ive been promoted  but europe is my purview  i was supposed to go there next week  i was going to take a picture where it looked like  i was holding up the leaning tower of pisa  now ill be taking that picture  do you have idea how strong ill look  i vanquished you in one day  i was trapped in a world  of wet wipes and rectal thermometers  then the babies came and life changed  but you set me free jack  now its weekends in new york  then jetsetting around the world in economy plus  ill be thousands of miles away from the chaos in brooklyn  do you know what its like to have triplets  its just everything times three  three pairs of grabby little hands  smearing food all over your brandnew chihuahua outfits  three pairs of feet in their weird soft little shoes  three paris of eyes brown  like my husbands  three perfect little mouths  that smile every time i walk through the door  three tummies  that just want their numnums and zerberts  oh god i just love my gaybies too
