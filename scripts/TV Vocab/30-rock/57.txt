deal breaker sketches together  yeah we write them together  she texts her gay friends while i write till 400 in the morning  eating dry fistfuls of raisin bran to stay awake  which by the way  is how im able to ride the fart train to work every day  lizhey  this is your job  this is what you signed up for  i know  i like it when you use your calm reasonable dad voice  thats the voice you should use when you tell jenna  that im gonna be in that magazine with her  ima save this for later  look at that scammer  what 21yearold wraps up half a muffin  hey  kenny  well hello stranger   do you like magazines  i sure like sm magazines  sm is my abbreviation for super and magical  chuckles yeah well  im selling magazine subscriptions  to benefit the uh community center   how many you want  four  great thats like 80  ima get your address from my daddy  oh instead of doing it now good plan  we gotta stop that guy  how can we prove to tracy that donalds lying  well ive asked cerie  to look into getting a copy of his birth certificate  no you cant get someone elses birth certificate  i know because ive been trying to steal  my dead neighbors identity  because sometimes it feels like too much  and maybe daddy just needs to get in the car and drive  we gotta catch donald in a lie  what else do we know about him  well he claims to know karate  thats gotta be bogus  but how do you test someones knowledge of karate  i know karate  um so gentlemen  is there any history of mental illness in your family  laughs oh dont get me started  my cousin killed everyone at his job  how bout you milton  no no the greenes are sharp as a tack  right to the end  which makes the end all that much more terrifying  my father died screaming  oh greene thats sort of a vague name  you meet a lot of other greenes at yourchurch  christmas  were agnostic secular humanists  sure but if you had to pick  is that you and tom delay  uh yes the hammer is a hero of mine   snorts  iim sorry  did you just snort at our former house majority leader  he was never my house majority leader  youve got to be kidding me  heres tom delays legacy to the united states  raping the environment waging an illegal war  history will validate the liberation of iraq  i was talking about the war on drugs  not to mention the hypocrisy of espousing family values  while demonizing single mothers  what would you know about single mothers  what would you know about families  i will not be spoken to this way  im a contest winner  and a professor at bennington college  laughing ohbennington  hows that going teaching all those kids  that couldnt get into middlebury   how dare you  how dare you  you are a huge disappointment to me  i do not understand why were yelling at each other  but i am not accustomed to losing an argument  so you know what screw you  and your fakakte contest  door slams  oh god no    looking beautiful  uhim gonna get some tape  oh my god liz  im so glad that youve insisted on doing this  yay well thank you for so graciously including me  i know this kind of thing is all that you have in your life  aw  waitwhat is that  what is that stuff  i just thought that for some of the pictures  itd be fun if we got a little wacky  giggles okay look  i know youve never done this before  but i had to learn the hard waydont use the props  they always try to get you to take one funny photo  thats always the one they use and you look like an idiot  thats always the one they use huh  dont do it  just open your mouth a little  and try to look like lindsay lohan  great fabulous ladies  you look beautiful  now jenna catch the chicken  nice try pal  not my first time on the merrygoround chief  not gonna do it  staying like this serious and horny  i dont know  with the chicken it could make a great cover  ill hold the chicken  laughing great thats great  thats so great  now act like the chicken farted  yes yes youre the funny one  great thats so great  i am lutz  i understand you study the art of the empty hand  i challenge you to kumite  hah whhhh eeee whooo  front kick front kick  uh uh escape kata  ow  pete liz i see you  help mommys baby  sobbing help mommys baby  jack what did you say to milton  if cornel west werent speaking at the new school tonight  i think he would have left  he should leave  its exactly what i was afraid of  more family more aggravation   im walking away  why hes just like you  hes smart and worldly  and hes really good at making fun of my shoes  when he saw these  he asked me when my cult was committing suicide  okay thats pretty good  but milton greene and i are nothing alike  i have one scotch with the guy  and it devolves into a screaming match about tom delay  so you have a couple drinks fight about politics  and then you take it personally when he doesnt agree with you  thats called having a dad jack  dont walk away  i think youll regret it if you do  or i could regret telling him  why would a man like that want me as a son  maybe he wont i dont know  but so what  yeah itd hurt  but then youd just go back to being jack donaghy  which is pretty cool  thank you my hair just dries like this  exactly or you tell him and he starts crying  and you hug and then you have a dad  which is pretty cool too   maybe youre right  i am right  either way youre gonna be okay  one of those two things is gonna happen  theres no weird third thing  thank you liz  by the way did the medical supply store  where you bought those shoes have anywomens stuff  chuckles  well donald obviously knows karate  we still dont know how old any africanamericans are  oh that reminds me  i got the birth certificate that you asked for  you did how  the guy at the place just gave it to me  you will get old someday  gasps  tracy stop writing that check  hes 40 dont sign that  okay that was to put in dotcoms birthday card  but youre right the card is enough  tracy donald is older than you are  hes scamming you  i know  im sorry what  liz lemon i may hug people too hard  and get lost at malls but im not an idiot  then why are you giving him all this money  when donald came to me  he was a fasttalking charmer  from the wrong side of the track  he reminded me of someone liz lemon  john travoltas character from grease  and me  so giving donald money is whatcharity  call it what you want  but in the last three years  donald has gone from scamming celebrities  to being a small business owner  the dojo is real  and the community center is thriving  you know kenneths 80 bought a chess set  and a crate of condoms  those kids are really lucky  knocking  hey  daddy do you wanna go uptown and see the dojo  or should i say the tracy jordan institute for black karate  whimpers  thats what yall namin it  thank you son  thank you  well i hope youre happy with your cover  oh boy  they went with birthing the chicken on the toilet  why didnt you listen to me  because i thought you were just trying  to keep me from being in the magazine  i was just trying to keep you from embarrassing both of us  well you wanted attention you got it  i hope youre happy  im on the cover  and this is the backstage area  kenneth id like to speak with mr greene for a moment  and as head of this tour im going to deny your request  uh milton  do you remember a woman named colleen donaghy  sure  laughs that takes me back a few years   1958  yeah right  she rented me a room when i was a graduate student  one month i couldnt pay  so she said maybe there was something else i could give her   so i gave her my radio  softly oh  and a couple of weeks later we got drunk and had sex  uhokay  im jack donaghy colleens son  i was born around nine months after that  oh my god whawait a minute  iis this contest some mamma mia thing  milton  im your son
