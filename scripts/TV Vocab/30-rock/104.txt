know for sure because i refuse to read  literature that questions the morality of war  look clearly i hurt your feelings  youre upset that i didnt tell you about criss  no no no im quite over your subterfuge  although i do expect a note of apology  and dont try to make it funny just apologize  but i feel like people expect comedy  they dont  its exhausting  however youre right that i am having an emotional reaction  its very frustrating to watch someone i care about  do something she clearly knows is bad for her  like that week you wore those blue contact lenses  i looked like adriana lima
