that maybe youre not being true to your you  i know what its like to live a lie  i used to be in the military  but i was unfairly thrown out because i went berserk  around all those dudes and tried to bang everybody  it has come to my attention  that some of what i said yesterday  may have been misconstrued  going both ways in football  means playing offense and defense  and there is nothing gay about the princeton fight song  oh the merry men of princeton are charging up the rear   holding all the balls  okay i hear it now  regardless im not gay or clumsy  so your little show has nothing with which to embarrass me  chair squeaks that was the chair  here ill show you  silence  it was the chair  what is this  jenna everyone here loves you very much  but because of your drinking we feel
