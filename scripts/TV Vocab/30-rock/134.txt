this  anyway that was one of the adoption agencies  were working with  and they may have a kid whos perfect for us  hes a threeyearold boy from transylvania  stay with me his name is dracul  hear me out  he is a hemophiliac with a sleep disorder  children change everything  right now you can do what you want  but once you have kids  you have to be on their schedule  watch their cartoons  and touch their poop  tracy you still do whatever you want  thats right i do  but you dont  so have fun while you can  be spontaneous you know stop being yourself  im spontaneous  for instance i started talking  before i had an example of how im spontaneous  nice haul mr ceo did you get my gift  i assume it was the bottle of wine  with the card reading dear doritos  what about just selling bags full of your dust  i could put it on chicken or fish  obviously there was a mixup  i wrote you a very heartfelt note  that said congratulations on becoming ceo  do you know anyone at doritos  well im not ceo yet  the board has to rubberstamp me  therell be a party for me later this week  then i have to drive around with my headlights off  until someone flashes me  then i have to well its not important  in the meantime im tying up some loose ends  im heading down to florida this afternoon  to take care of my mothers estate  fittingly she left everything to her livein nurse martha  the house i paid for the silver  my grandfathers purple heart  its terrible what alcoholism can do to the body  she really didnt leave you anything  thats not very nice i loved my mother lemon  obviously because of stockholm syndrome  but she was on her best day a miserable old crone  whose only joy came in sharing her unhappiness  with others even in death  she is the only person in the world  to have sarcastic last words  i just want you to be happy  mother how i miss you  anyway i thought you might like to come to florida with me  i can get you a vip pass  to universals harry potter world  okay i am not some kind of nerdery slut  i like star wars  lemon im not relishing this trip  it would be nice to have someone with me   are you coming or not  yes i am  hows that for spontaneous florida on a work day  to that store  that sells longsleeve spf shirts  s07 ep10  florida   hey i need somebody to sign for this water  no you need a nobody to sign for that water  were on tv  okay then whos in charge  well liz but shes in florida  or pete but he went to a line producers convention  in albany  i saw him pack a wig  tracy does this mean were in charge  where do you want the water  im sorry where is liz lemon  shes out of the office  is there anything we could help you with  weve got about ten minutes  before weve got to go watch shopping  well this does affect the two of you  im martin lutherking from nbcs inhouse counsel  a former tgs employee has filed a harassment lawsuit  against this production and both of you individually  complainant is seeking damages in the amount  of 50 million  hold my calls giant bee  i assume you know this woman   wassername  whats her name  so these are the things your mother wanted you to have  the baby shoe she found after that fire  god she loved looting  colleen was such a lovely woman  thank you martha but you dont have to do that  i mean you knew colleen  and theres so much i miss  her kindness her laugh  her laugh of course  she was the happiest person i ever met  sure  remind me of some of the happy things  my mother would do  you know tell jokes  and the pranks  her nickname here was mrs silly  tell me martha  how long did you work for my mother exactly  im sorry  what the hell was that  shell miss colleens laughter  that woman clearly didnt even know my mother  this is a scam  she took advantage of an old lady  i saw this on dateline  next well be holding hands in adjacent bathtubs  or maybe that was a cialis commercial its all a blur  im calling the police  thank you for calling florida emergency services  if this is regarding an anaconda in a crawl space  press 1  if a sinkhole full of indian bones has appeared  in your living room press 2  if you want to know why jag wasnt on this week  press 3  if your shabbos goy  why cant we just cut this state adrift  and let it crash into cuba  well just solve this ourselves like that woman  on dateline who tried to solve her sisters murder  then disappeared  but we wont go scubadiving with the husband  lemon when martha comes back  ill distract her while you sneak around  and go through her things  its a caper whos spontaneous now tracy  okay start from the beginning  well the plaintiffs deposition alleges that  no further back  what kind of dinosaur was your grandfather  the plaintiff alleges that there is  a widespread culture of depravity here at tgs  sexual harassment intimidation threats of violence  her deposition is very gross  im going to use this doll to show you  what tracy and jenna did to me  no no no  yes  shes lying like a rug  rug is an offensive term for persians that i made up  we would never do that to a page  maybe that tall asian one  yeah miranda  her hair is so thick and black  please dont include me in this  look legal views this as a frivolous lawsuit  hazel wassername aka richard drench  has a long history of suing former employers  so all we need is for everyone who works at tgs  to sign this affidavit  saying that they have never witnessed  or been party to any inappropriate behavior  i once played a lawyer in a movie  so i know all about winning your sons love back  thanks to a magic camera  yes movies are terrible  well dont worry well get everyone to sign  we really dont want this to go to court  for a number of reasons  you two could be personally liable for any damages  hank hooper hates any type of negative publicity like this  and i didnt superduper finish law school  so  im sorry about that  i just miss your mother so much  she was an angel that fell from heaven  yes  so was lucifer  do you have a bathroom i could use  down at the end of the hall  i may be in there a while because i have  a gluten thing that turns my business white  just go  so martha tell me some more funny colleen stories  colleen had two night tables  kama sutra  who is m  shmesbians  where are my manners this is florida  let me boil up a pot of hot gatorade  is blue okay  jack bedroom  lies marthas been telling me  colleen loved children and animals  the only animal colleen ever bought me was a myna bird  who was later revealed to be colleens personal spy  i told that bird everything  no jack its not a scam  i think martha and colleen were together   have you lost your mind  its a thing  men die first and these older women are alone  and turn to each other for companionship  like my aunt linda and her roommate jean  but they werent lesbians  my god of course they were  lemon listen to what youre saying  colleen donaghy was gay  she stopped watching the bruins  because derek sandersons mustache made him look  like he takes his sandwich with a pickle  they shared a bed jack a sleep number bed  set to two drastically different firmness levels  only an insane person would do that  if they were sleeping alone  insane  martha tricked colleen into thinking  she was her friend  and of course two friends can share a bed  for example abraham lincoln and his roommate  joshua fry speed slept in the same bed together  until joshua died from dancing too long at a party  the gatorades on  while were waiting i dvrd a documentary  about the woman who designed all of pat summitts blazers  kenneth we have a sign affidavit  regarding this hazel situation  from everyone on the tgs crew except you  look i get it  i know how former lovers can have a hold over you  long after theyre gone  in some ways im still pinned  under a passedout harvey weinstein  and its thanksgiving  but the truth is hazel is gone ken jennings  and to prove it we hid a camera on a gigolo friend of ours  and asked him to seduce hazel  sloppy rodney do you know him  he has syphilis  hey baby you want to get down  sloppy rodney  its me richard drench  i remember that ass  please stop  hazel isnt the reason i wont sign that affidavit  the truth is i have seen a lot of inappropriate things  here at tgs  and i dont want to lie about it  whats the big deal  lying is easy  for example there isnt a hole in my pocket  i keep touching my penis through  see easy  not for me sir  ive lost a lot this past year  i went from being a page to a janitor  my girlfriend dumped me  the only thing i have left is my integrity  now you both know i would do anything for you  but i want you to think long and hard  before you ask me to sign that affidavit  because youd be making me give up who i am   whatever sign it  sign it  i apologize  we never had the need for a second bedroom around here  this is usually where i store  my woodworking tools and the pottery i make  whats the problem lemon  theyre just lumpy flowers  now i dont know who usually sleeps on which side  so i put a strawberry calcium chew  on both night tables for you liz  were coworkers ms edwards  were not no no no  im sorry i just assumed  thats quite all right  a lot of people are making wild assumptions today  our relationship is purely platonic  if plato had an elderly shutin aunt  you know what plato did have  a gay relationship with socrates  lemon the only way youre like socrates  is you have the body hair of a greek man  are you sure you arent married  cause this seems pretty married  siri find me the nearest hotel  finding hookers is that right  you dont want to go out  the vietnam vets are starting to retire  and they get antsy at night around all these palm trees  no thats all right  we can sleep together  because theres nothing weird about two friends sharing a bed   right jack  of course not  your pajamas have a turtleneck  theyre from the ll bean  maritime professional collection  so what way do you want  to totally normally sleep together  facetoface or butttobutt  careful old mattress  it goes without saying lemon  that nothing will happen in this bed tonight  and i am referring of course to your  digestive failings  id laugh but im trying not to do  the thing that you just referred to  why didnt anything ever happen between us  good god lemon  if youre trying to conjure my mothers ghost  you could just shake a jar of coins  while praising jimmy carter  no im not saying i wanted something to happen  but why didnt something happen  weve spent a lot of time together  weve been drunk together and daydrunk together  and on the rebound at the same time  and also youre kind of a slut  i did sleep with jenna a lot during season three  if i were a different person  would you have hit on me  i understand what youre getting at lemon  there was a particularly youthoriented priest  in my childhood parish who went after everybody but me  even fat ralph and he ate his boogers  i felt so unpretty  no this isnt about appearance jack  did nothing ever happen between us  because im not fun  good god lemon  obviously our relationship however you define it  mentormentee  sisterployeework oracle  is more interesting than some dating scenario  and obviously to ruin what we have  with a tawdry yet expert sexual encounter  wouldve been a mistake  obviously but is it the kind of mistake  that i should have made  tracy told me i havent lived  youre allowing tracy to criticize  your life choices tracy jordan  now what  but hes right  i havent done anything impulsive ever  i dont have any tattoos or broken bones  ive never been high  except for that choir trip to montreal  where i accidentally ate a pound of marijuana  also maybe i was never attracted to you  because youre the kind of person who finds a way  to talk about herself while lying in my dead mothers bed  okay  well for the record its mutual  i wasnt exactly chomping at the bit  to be with a middleaged man with crippling mommy issues  first of all its champing at the bit  horses champ  and second of all im not going to fight in bed with a woman  im not even having sex with  why is it weird  of course its weird   lincoln was super gay  thank you  and i dont even want to think about my mother  and i know those pots arent flowers  theyre my mothers vagina  jaymo i like to flouring a joke about bjorks swan dress  tired  ive seen dresses  that look fly  but never dresses that can fly  i couldnt sleep at all last night  ive got this weird sick feeling in my stomach  me too  its the same feeling i got in 1997  when that jury foreman looked at me and said  guilty  and i had to close my water park  i forgot to make an opening at the end of the slide  is that what this is guilt  i dont think so  i mean what have we done to feel guilty about  we dont care that we made kenneth lie right  no come on its kenneth  although he has been acting a little different  since yesterday  what did i miss a spot  i dont care  all i care about is which jazz club  im going to tonight  hes broken  good morning jack  you sleep okay  colleens myna bird told me you spent the night in the car  i slept fine  before you leave i wanted you to have this  that was taken at the wrap party  for our community centers production of grease  your mother was sandy  well the fourth sandy  the first three died falling off the car  during summer lovin  i dont know the last time i saw her so happy  im glad she had you to take care of her  lemon  jack you need to come to orlando and pick me up  im in harry potter world jail  kenneth parcell isnt signing your precious affidavit  that is a christmas card from my estranged daughter  tell him ken  if youve ever experienced anything inappropriate at work  just tell the truth  well sir  no kenneth you have something in your teeth  im just trying to lick it off  let me do it im your friend  want to see a porno my cousin is in  to close a very important deal  im going to need to loan you to david geffen  for the weekend  why do i even take birth control pills  if im always gonna be alone  you might as well take them kenneth  you take them  take them  now for days that werent my birthday  get me philadelphia  cause i wanted to sound cool okay tucker  fine get me gary derekson  well i did it  i tried to live life and it sucked  i came here without studying the park map beforehand  which is how i ended up in a long line  that turned out to just be a crowd of people  watching two owls have sex  then the park started to fill up  but im being spontaneous so i tried to cut the line  for the flight of the hippogriff  which is when duncan here caught me  what is the point jack  i am who i am and im never gonna change  ill die full of regrets  like that time i sat next to richard grieco  on an airplane and just let him read his hustlers  without ever telling him i was a fan  lemon youre wrong  people can change  maybe tomorrow maybe when youre 85  youll find a reason to do something  totally out of character  after all thats what colleen did  not to make this about me  but are you admitting that i was right  about your mothers lateinlife lezout  i just cant believe it  i know and a woman of color too good for her  no not that i cant believe she was happy  she was mrs silly   sketch idea  at the end  when she said she just wanted me to be happy  i thought she was being sarcastic  because when i was growing up i thought people  who wanted to be happy were weak  hippies italians kindergarten teachers  what am i supposed to do with this  i dont know how to be happy  what are you talking about  that is enough of your black irish nonsense  of course youre happy  its never been the goal lemon  the goal has always been money or prestige  or when playing hockey the goal  jack in an hour you are flying to new york city  on a private jet to a party celebrating you  as kabletowns next ceo  its everything youve ever wanted  and colleen is looking down on you right now  and youre happier than youve ever been  of course i am  hello beverly  its just bev liz  my mother died while naming me  well i do have an opportunity for an immediate placement  really okay  there is one issue  its two children a brother and a sister  and we dont want to split them up  two boy that wasnt our plan  i know its a lot to take on  why dont you discuss it  with that little action figure youre married to  no no well do it   are you sure  yes well take them  well take both kids  there you are liz  im on my way up to see jack  but as long as im still ceo i want to say two things  one did you get a little sun youre glowing  and two because of the lawsuit and the pr nightmare  and the den of sin youve built here  i have to go ahead and cancel tgs  next friday is your last show  great news liz  kenneth doesnt have different hair anymore  liz liz  i showed up without a bra one day  and i was viciously harassed until i put on a shirt  i once saw kenneth parcell naked  it was horrible  his body is just a smooth beige tube  with a head  frank rossitano was always trying  to give me pornography  that i had given him in the first place  i mean what a regifter  there were these two africanamerican giants  that were always pressuring me  to join their book club  can have please a glass with water thank you
