subscription to the new yorker  she vehemently opposes the ivory trade  despite the jobs it creates  and in her apartment there is a blackandwhite photograph  where you can almost see a breast  its an original leonard nimoy  if we do not defeat obama  then people like my little friend here  will destroy this country  so add a zero to whatever you were planning to give  for romney for america  for

fundraiser  for my personal super pac  americans for an american america  i needed to unite the room around a common enemy  and ed begley jr wasnt available  because the sail on his car broke  see this is why 501 of americans hate republicans  because youre sneaky and cynical  cynical i think im the very opposite of cynical  im doing everything i can for my beliefs  and i truly believe that one rich person  can make a difference in this country  and a roomful of rich people can change the world  well i also believe that one person can make a difference  with ideas  that really is wonderful  harold you have to hear this lemon say that again  ideas are more powerful than money  so what are you gonna do with all this money jack  buy ad time  cause im already on tv every night  with a little something called tgs  and we just got nominated for a stage managers guild award  so you may have millions of dollars sir  but america will hear my two cents  thats not what people want lemon  least of all from their televisions  they want their honeys boo boo  and their sunday night feetball  which is the plural of football  americans dont want to think  thats why they need men like me  to pick their presidents for them  wow okay  so i guess its my words versus your money  and well see who can really make a difference  in this election  its on donaghy  may the best gender nonspecific person win  just leave the amount blank harold  those are tampons  deal with it  for gods sake some of us have jobs  ive got a pile of 1020gs up he  with no travel times on them  and if i dont  listen up

 i dont think thats a thing  well its just at this point in the campaign  for us its more about ideas than cash  garrett i would slap you  if i didnt know you were going to get your own planet  when you die  and until your father has  i think we can still make a difference  i mean look how poorly were polling with africanamericans  jack theres no amount of money that could  how dare you talk that way in front of the pile  aw thanks jack  there is no problem in the world  that cant be solved by throwing money at it  now lets change some black minds  look what jennas goons have done  petes going

everyone knows romney has  a vacation home in new hampshire  what they dont know  is that he hunts humans on that property  new hampshire goes to obama  now north carolina goes to romney  i worked there this summer  and they are not on board with a black man lecturing them  i dont care if its obama talking about health care  or me talking about white butts  they are different than black butts  pennsylvania is obamas  the voting machines there have become sentient  and for some reason  they are strongly in favor of gay marriage  but were not gonna win wisconsin  i dont know why  ever since tracy set fire to lambeau field  wisconsinites are coming around on the death penalty  wisconsin goes for romney  that just leaves  florida the penis of america  florida  the penis of america  pete
