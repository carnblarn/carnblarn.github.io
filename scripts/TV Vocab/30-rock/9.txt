being stung by a bee or getting a splinter  or being chained to a wall in someones sex dungeon  isnt that a kick in the soft stuff kenneth  i  mean you gain strength from your mother while mine is sucking the life out of me  she calls me constantly that was her  that was her  complaining about where shes living threatening to move in with me  oh how wonderful  no no no thats not wonderful i run companies plural  but to that woman  im always gonna be the punk kid who cried when pop was run over by a mail truck  oh my a mailman killed your dad  no pop was my dog  my dad left when i was two so i grew up calling my collie pop  my mother is my best friend  my mother tried to send me to vietnam to make a man out of me  i was 12  well my mother has her dark times too  but thats when i tell her mama you carried me for nine months  let me carry you now  you are a remarkable human being kenneth  i bought my mother a lovely retirement home in florida  with a tea garden and fake rocks made of foam because she falls down a lot  got everything she needs except a phone  i told those people i made it clear do not give her a phone  its her its always her  hello  this is dr leo spaceman  oh hi im sorry  i got this number under fertility in the writers guild health manual  im also listed under meth addiction and child psychiatry  so what can i help you with  i should start by saying that i cant personally help you conceive  something happened to me while scuba diving  hey so jenna tells us youre looking for a babydaddy  she what  yeah so  so  are you kidding me  now okay before you say no i just wanna say  our child would have a leg up getting into harvard  oh really did you go to harvard  cause you havent mentioned it in like three hours  our kid would have strong flat feet  and if you choose me i agree not to take my shirt off  but i do like to get yelled at during sex  youre disgusting  yeah thats a good start  ugh  get out of here  jenna had no business telling you guys that  oh hey blue pages what whats wrong  jenna told the writers that im looking for a guy to get me pregnant  can you believe her  i know its so uncool  i mean why would she go to them who do you know better than me  oh come on  didnt you have a vasectomy  no i just told my wife i did  and she doesnt get pregnant how  i fake it  is jenna out here is she rehearsing  shes onstage  excuse me ms lemon  uh  im not usually this formal nor this bold but i figure time is on neither one of our sides  uh could you excuse us for a second  id kind of like him to stay  very well  ms lemon liz  id like to carry your child if i might  i have a small ferret farm about 60 miles north of the city  its not much but it is selfsufficient  i can get cable if you want cause i know how much you like the tv  sometimes  i watch you watching it  think about it  jenna  stop telling everyone i need someone to get me pregnant  im not telling everyone  all right guys check this out  oprah and steadman are the same person  you know what  i dont have time for this conversation  i dont have time for anything  thats why heshe wont run for president  hey you gotta stop doing that impression  tracy hates it

do that  too late this is untoward  this is not toward  you better fix this nerd  otherwise jack donaghy is gonna kill me and then hes gonna kill you  and then hes gonna fold us up in a pizza and eat

looking for sperm donors  okay  but do you still want a sound hookup so you can listen to rehearsal  yeah thanks  how are you bobby good  great  yo  tracy its jack donaghy  i hear we have a problem  with josh gerard  damn right keeps impersonating me  making me into a caricature  well i would take care of this if i could  but its tricky  you see joshs fathers an assassin with the russian mafia  they call him el matador  whoa those dudes are crazy  forget it i dont need any of that noise  it  happys me to hear you say that  for being so understanding  im sending you our new super top secret invisible motorcycle  for reals  laughing for realses  now if youll excuse me i need to see a doctor  i keep pooping during sex  lemon we have a problem  i have this whole tracyjosh thing under control  what are you talking about  nothing what are you talking about  you you yelling at the crew you trolling for seed  oh its a big misunderstanding  jenna thinks that i want to have a baby  i should have known this was going to be a problem when i decided to mentor a woman  no in fact what i said was that my body is trying to make me think i wanna have a baby  but my body is not the boss of me my brain is  all right if you insist upon going all murphy brown on me let me give you a tip  dont smother your child with affection to compensate for not having a man in your life  dont say youre the only man ill ever love even babies know thats creepy  of course  dont put little notes in their lunch bag that say mommys watching you  people find those things  i bet you behaved yourself though  if your child is a terrific hockey player and a gifted flautist dont make them play the national anthem on the flute in front of their teammates  your mother did that  now she wants to move in with me  i cant have that lemon  then be an adult and call her and say you love her very much  but that living together is not going to work for you  oh no you dont know my mother  this is a woman that actually had a heart attack to prevent me from going on my honeymoon  maybe her heart broke because she spent 20 years raising you and youre a total ingrate  thats exactly what she said  is this what you want lemon to breathe life into another human being  just to spend the rest of your days slowly sucking it out of them  no thats why my brain is the boss  speak of the devil  take a breath be nice  hello mother so nice to hear your voice  no i am not on anything  i know that things have been difficult for you lately and i was thinking you carried me for nine months  let me carry you now  well right back at you colleen  yeah thats right  you cut pops balls off  and left him in the street to die  liz check out my wedding dress  absolutely not young lady  kenneth get donaghy on the phone

invisible motorcycles  sex pooping  are you insane  what are you gonna do when tracy asks jack for his invisible motorcycle  uh yeah dummy  heres what youre gonna do  its not your mother  hello  donaghy  whats up tray  if in the future  in the future   if i mention anything crazy  if i mention anything crazy   like an invisible motorcycle  like an invisible motorcycle   it means im off my
