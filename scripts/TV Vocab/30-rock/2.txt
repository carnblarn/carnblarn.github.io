matching mr westens description  was spotted driving away from the scene  white male dark hair   clears throat  athletically built  i hope your department pays overtime  because youre gonna be searching  for a few hundred thousand suspects  ive got just one  stuffs been blowing up pretty steadily  since you arrived in miami  so are you gonna answer my questions  or am i gonna pick my way through everything you own  that would be a workbench six power tools  four yogurts  three yogurts  i actually had one blueberry  well you can tell me all about it at the station mr westen  get in the

time up at raiford mediumsecurity  says hi by the way  her brother jumped bail on forgery charges  i chased him to boca  had to hit him with a brick to get him in the car  sweet guy  he your partner  well youd have to ask him that  what can we help you with   sighs  this is my son brandon  hes been staying with his dad howard  were separated  howard hasnt let me see or talk to brandon for three days  well it sounds like you should be talking to a lawyer about this  i have  three of them  they all say itll take months to get him into court  howard just needs someone to knock some sense into him   its not a problem  anything else you need  i just want to see my son  everything will be fine  right michael   horn honking   excuse me  do you know my new girl  she rebuilt this engine by herself  im telling you  just put a nice sturdy tool in that womans hand   i got it sam find out anything  yeah i asked around about your lady detective  turns out you got a stalker with a badge  i mean she checked every selfstorage place  from here up to fort lauderdale  she found some surveillance video  of you ducking into a place down by homestead  not good what you got there  some c4 and detonators  well shes gonna own them soon cause shes working on a warrant  theres a hearing in a couple of days  but you got to get your stash out of there before then  fiona are you coming michael  oh mike uh you know  since im helping you avoid felony charges  i thought maybe thered be a lunch in it for me  michael  next time  geez  i got you baby  patricia typical  howard spends 80 hours a week at the office  and he cant find an hour to take care of his yard   cellphone ringing   fiona go ahead and take it  just keep your eyes on the street  this should be pretty straightforward  yeah ma  its somebodys birthday today  i thought you could come over for a nice dinner  with sam and fiona  were celebrating birthdays now  we always did dont you remember sixth grade  your friend billy kane was there  it was his party mom  well its never too late  all right where are we getting takeout from  who said anything about takeout   paper hits floor   howard  so you coming or not ill try  michael i dont want to hear how youll try i want you to promise  fine i promise ill try  howard   engine turns over    tires squeal   you can stop now  you can stop now  ugh oh  howard  we just want to see your son  oh you dont understand  im sure whatever the issue is you can work it out with your ex  no thats not what i mean  he was kidnapped  of course he was  brandon didnt come home from school on thursday  i got a call uh i dont know the guys name  is he asking for money  no iii work at a diamond wholesaler  he wanted information about an upcoming shipment  said not to contact the police  or id never  see brandon again  hes calling today with instructions  how could you not tell me  i didnt want you calling the police patricia  i was trying to protect brandon  that was not your decision to make hes my son too  look he just wants diamonds im going to give them to him  howard its not that simple  if this guy really wants to disappear  he has no incentive to return your son  brandons old enough to identify him  whoa whoa wwhat  what are you saying  you know what hes saying howard  theyre not gonna bring us brandon back alive  we should call the police no  no cops he said he would kill him  enough  michael and i will take care of him  without involving the cops  but you cant be at each others throats okay  when the kidnapper calls again  youre going to say youre not doing anything  until you get proof that your son is alive and unhurt  and then youre gonna ask for a facetoface meeting  you think hell come  if he wants his diamonds he will  and if were lucky well follow him back to where brandon is  well wont that be dangerous  it doesnt matter ill do it  whatever it takes to get brandon back  i told howard not to take that stupid job  sales manager  we were doing just fine as reps  you work together we did  it was great till he took that promotion  long hours travel and now this  well im sure this was not part of the plan  when he took the job  well he should have known the risk  patricia i want you to try something  its a relaxation exercise i do in situations like this  i want you to close your eyes  and breathe deep  picture a peaceful mountain stream  can you do that  now picture yourself  drowning the kidnapper in the stream  youre taking a rock from the stream  and raising it above your head michael fi  and with tremendous force youre bringing   fi  we got something hes passed by twice  smart criminals have a variety of ways  to find out if a meeting is under police surveillance  some are more subtle than others  howard right yeah  im santora  nice to meet you  ugh oh oh  throw a few punches  and any cops in the area have to come running  god do something  we cant hes testing us  but hes gonna kill him hes   whoa patricia patricia  if you want your son back youll stay in the car  you got any friends around here i should know about  ugh  you tell anyone about our little arrangement   groans  look at me howard  behavior in a combat situation is unpredictable  sometimes trained soldiers go screaming for the hills  sometimes guys who have never fired  anything bigger than a cap gun  turn out to have ice in their veins   breathing heavily   nobody knows  let me see my son  todays headline the kids fine  now lets be clear  youre not calling the shots here  youre not gonna make any more demands  and youre not gonna try anything cute  if anyone touches me  if im a minute late checking in with my guys  you never see the kid again  got it  yeah  good  ugh  thats just so you dont forget  now  lets talk about my diamonds  in the field its often your human instincts  that jeopardize an operation  helping people is great  but there are times that impulse can get people killed  sometimes the right thing to do is let a guy bleed for a while  stay here   moans   he kept hitting me i didnt know what to do  you did everything right howard  he said he wants the stones in 24 hours  or brandon dies  thats not gonna happen  howd we do  uh not so great  santora didnt go near the kid  hes hanging out at a bar sipping mojitos  mike this guys not afraid to be seen  but i thought you could follow him to where brandon is  i thought  hes smart  hes keeping the job compartmentalized  howards at the hospital getting stitches  that was all for nothing  not nothing well know when he moves  i got a buddy keeping an eye on him  why cant you just grab him and waterboard him or something  make him tell us where brandon is  you torture somebody  theyll tell you anything to make it stop  no there are better ways to get reliable information  sam how do you feel about a little  reverse interrogation  never been a big fan mike  whats reverse interrogation  we used to do it during the cold war  you send one of your guys in there to be interrogated  to learn what the bad guys are worried about  you play your cards right  their questions will tell you all about them  you play your cards wrong   have a little faith sam  how long do you think itll take to set up  car building  some cop lights  a couple hours  all right call me when its done  were gonna find your son  this is a valuable lesson for you  c4 is meant to be used not stored  ill keep that in mind  im serious  all those times you told me to make the explosions smaller  i shouldnt have listened to you  then paxson wouldnt have anything to hang you with  when youre concerned  you might be walking into a police stakeout  there are a number of things to look out for   parked cars or vans  hold on fi  workers that seem unusually preoccupied  and curious kids  no matter where you go in the world  little boys like candy puppies and cops  i think our detective friend had a surprise planned  mr westen  detective paxson and detective forgetyourname  you know i was thinking about renting one of these storage units  you mind if i look at yours  storage unit  yes or you could give us  the fake name you used when you rented it  or go ahead and clear it out dont let us stop you  i think theres been a big misunderstanding  i actually heard you were in the neighborhood  and i came by to see you  yeah i wanted to give you some receipts   you know give you a better idea  of what ive been doing where ive been going  that ones for breakfast fi had a spanish omelet  egg whites only thank you  well if you get the urge to destroy any evidence  stop by  well be waiting for you  was that flirting or does she hate you  i am not her type   cellphone ringing   yeah sam  hey mike you ready to do this im all set  seriously though i think this is a little risky  im on my way   siren wailing   when it comes to cover ids impersonating a bad cop  is much better than impersonating a good one  an honest cop follows policies and procedures  from the way he cuts his hair to the approach he takes  when carrying out a traffic stop  pose as a good cop and you have to go by the book  pose as a bad cop  and you can throw out that book and write your own  hi there detective finley  wow nice seats  what is that pearl leather  let me call my lawyer he can tell you all about them   chuckling  all right just relax  im here unofficially  just think of this as a business meeting  you want to do a business meeting  how about you make an appointment   chuckling  okay  whens a good time to talk about someone  whos trying to move in on one of your scores  just worked a drug bust  heard something that might interest you  in the criminal world selling yourself as a colleague  often means doing something illegal  so while snorting lactose isnt pleasant   snorts   it may put peoples minds at ease  oh ho got this on the bust too   sniffles   puts hair on your chest ill tell you that  whats this you heard about a score  yeah it was a coke buy down in overtown  busted a guy i know a junkie named shep  so hes trying to get me to lay off him  cause he says he knows something about a plan  to uh rip you off  some junkie told you this  yeah hes a snitch  hey the guys a mess but his intels usually good  so whyd you bust him  well i take him in every so often just to keep him in line  so listen im taking him to the station  for a couple of grand  you can question him first  interested  he said something about a kid if that means anything  a kid  yeah he didnt say much more than that  man i cannot get over this leather  its handtooled right  where is this guy  madeline so what youre saying is  michaels missing his own birthday party  hhes busy  busy  busy being shot at or busy get blown up  does he ever take a day off  ow damn it  i mean you know  a little consideration is all im asking  im making an effort so should he  well he seems to be making progress  dont fool yourself honey  loving michael is always trench warfare  hmm  you tell him to come to the party  sam busted a few raves here  dont worry no one comes around now  place is condemned  its where i do my uh freelance work  so the snitch is in there you got my money  here you go ill take it from here  oh oh no my friend  thats not how it works  we question this guy together  no offense but i dont like people knowing my business  yeah no offense but i dont care  your business doesnt concern me  what concerns me is nobody touches my prisoner but me  i got my own way of asking questions  yeah and i got to explain every scratch on the guy  when i take him down to the station  so if you want to come down there with me thats fine  otherwise we do this my way  and what about later  this guy shep gets to mouth off   laughs  dont worry about that  i got enough on this guy to send him to prison on the moon  hell keep his mouth shut  santora so nobody knows you got this guy here huh  sam  chuckles  dont get any ideas  as far as my supervisors concerned  im working on a case  officially im in the middle of interviewing you  so if anything happens to me  he knows who to come looking for  lets do this  so i dont know you  but i hear you know me  and my business  interrogation professionals dont ask questions directly  they hide what they know and dont know  aw youre a real prince finley  a real standup guy  after all ive done for you this is what i get  nothing personal just business  amateurs tend to ask for exactly what they want  who told you about the kid  its like playing poker with your cards showing  i think your buddy here wants to kiss me finley  hey im not that type  ugh  answer the question  sam who told you  a friend of a friend  i didnt get his name  they didnt give me details i didnt ask for them  all right tell me about this job   sighs   they needed help moving a  a kid  they wanted a place that they could stash him  for a few days off the street  i found it can i go now  you can go when i find out what the hell is going on  the guy who hired you   he say when they were planning this  oh come on you think theyre gonna tell me when  yeah right after they told me  their vacation plans and their social security numbers  i dont know  you got a smart mouth  maybe you should start using it to save your ass  they told me to find a place  where they could stash the kid  for a few days  do you want me to say that slower  whered you meet them  right do you think im stupid  i tell you that  and youre gonna go tell them and im gonna get killed  you worry about that later you got more immediate problems  ugh   coughing  all right all right  all right  it was a restaurant  a diner i think  when people are desperate for information  they start filling in the blanks  often without realizing it  its something fortunetellers rely on  it works pretty much the same way for spies  think harder  although fortunetellers  usually dont get smacked around as much   groans   it was a diner  it had burgers and fries  the seaside diner  was that it off the causeway  yes thank you  i met the guy at the seaside diner  whatd this guy look like  well i dont know  hhe was a guy  was a white guy maybe  white  im just gonna go out in miami and look for a white guy  youre gonna have to do better than that  no all right all right all right  it was  it was  the waitress knew him  she called him flowers  they knew him there  and thats it thats  thats  thats all i know  man yeah this is jimmy  get over to the seaside diner now  ask around for a guy named flowers   chuckles   surprising how much a guy remembers  when you help him out a little  listen this is taking longer than i thought  i got to make a call you two play nice  fi get over to the seaside diner  its off macarthur causeway santora is sending a guy there  you might be able to tail him back to brandon  just stay out of sight all right  fiona stay out of sight  youre seriously telling me that  well its nothing personal  things are just getting a little tense around here  so you and your friends thought that you could rip me off  that right what was the plan with the kid  i told you everything i know i was supposed to get   what was the plan  i was paid a lousy  you think i dont want to tell you  put the knife away  youve got a sharp knife  michael get that knife out of my face  fi just go now  aah  fine  you want to  you want to know the plan  yeah i do  all right well  youre never gonna know the plan with a knife  because cutting me up aint gonna turn me into a mind reader  whoa there friend  my prisoner  my rules remember  now you want me to lean on him  all you have to do is ask  we clear  now put it away   breathing heavily   we may have a lead on brandons location  youre going to get him now  if things go according to plan  ill come with you i can help  well thats sweet and very brave  but you are gonna get yourself shot  well if thats what it takes to get our son back i dont care  brandon is gonna need you alive  getting shot sounds noble  until it actually happens to you  dont volunteer for it unless its absolutely necessary  brandons gonna be fine  i know it  you want to do something for your son  dont forget this moment  yeah  and dont ever work together  not all couples can handle it   door closes   okay so this flowers   he show you where the kid is  no ttthey drove me through the neighborhood   tthe route they were gonna take  i dont remember   ive had enough of youdontremember  no more warnings  ive answered all your questions  i want you to tell me who is trying to rip me off  and i want a house on star island  filled with strippers and bikinis  but wishing just doesnt make it so man  its time to focus  now listen i assume there isnt a sign on the place  that says the kid is here  so how would he know if he saw it  come on you got guys with the kid  maybe shep saw them  yeah i got two guys michael yeah could be  i saw a couple of guys but i didnt talk to them i dont know their names  did you see the kid no  okay santora so calm down he didnt see the kid  maybe its not the same place  he didnt see him because the kid  is in a shed behind the house  now shut up and let me think  searching for a concealed enemy who could be anywhere  is a waste of time  yeah its jimmy  nobodys heard of flowers at the diner  usually your best bet is to stay put  and give your enemy a reason to come to you  whats going on  is there something i should know about  dont worry about it  just get back to the house and watch the kid  camera shutter clicks   to tail someone you need both skill and instinct  you need skill because the driving is tough  you cant get too close  and you cant drift too far away  you cant go too fast or too slow  you need instinct because every turn  every lane change every bridge raises the risk of being seen  anyone can be trained to follow a car  but it takes good instincts  to know when its time to stop following  so i had one of my guys ask around  no one at that restaurant  ever heard of anyone named flowers  why is that mmy fault  maybe he went to the wrong place  he went to the diner you lying son of a bitch  why would i lie to you  thats it  im shutting this thing down before it gets any worse  when you work with someone long enough  you learn to trust them  when things go bad  that trust is the difference between life and death  of course knowing that doesnt make it less terrifying  to back a play you know nothing about  listen uh  i know this guy shep  i mean hes a pain in the ass but his information is good  yeah because he told me some story about a guy who doesnt exist  maybe the guy does exist  he could be one of your own guys  so one more time  this flowers guy  what did he look like  he has uh slickedback hair  he was a muscle guy  uh  he wears those muscle shirts  you know to show off his arms  thats the best i can do thats all i got  thats flowers youre sure  yeah thats the guy who told me about the kid  ugh  hey hey  what is wrong with you  santora thats my guy  like you said my own guy is trying to steal from me  what guy  his names jimmy  the guy i sent to the diner to look for flowers   it turns out the son of a bitch is flowers  hes supposed to be watching the kid  instead hes planning to rip me off  you know you can call it off  let the kid go  hell just give him to me  ill tell his parents i found him wandering around  its too late for that  he saw my face its over  i got to clean this whole mess up  whoa whoa what are you gonna with that  listen youve been a standup guy  i appreciate that  and i dont want to cause you problems  but that guy in there shep  hes got to die  now  every profession has occupational hazards  butchers cut themselves  house painters fall off ladders  and operatives get asked to help kill their own people   laughing  hey you watch it friend  i got unis checking on my interview  back off  this is my snitch  i got to be able to explain what goes on  my own guys are turning on me  if hes part of it hes got to go  they all do  oh i see so im just supposed to sit back  and hope none of this blows back on me  no way pal thats not how this goes down  you got any ideas im listening  yeah  yeah i say that uh  dropped him off by the road  i let him out cause he was sick from the dope  ill just tell them that  that he attacked me  and he tried to escape  wait you  yeah dont you remember hes my prisoner  how am i gonna explain a suspect  thats full of these random bullet holes  well have the damn fbi here its better this way  put a few rounds in his chest with my gun  but you do it out by the road you understand  your gun what the hell are you talking about  look i got to be able to sell this story to my department  if i dont theyre coming after me  trust me its better this way  come on come on  all right  ill go get shep  you get your guy on the phone you tell him to sit tight  i dont want this situation any worse than it already is   groans    both grunt   michael oh  you all right mike  yeah you still pack a pretty good punch sam  yeah well the good news is  santoras planning on going back to the kid  fi followed their guy  theyre holed up on an island off the causeway  and the bad news  santora wants to kill you first  i convinced him to do it with my gun  up on the side of the road  make it look like you were trying to get away  how far is the road  a couple hundred yards  i guess itll have to do  mike if there was any other way  there isnt  all right when you get free  take his car and head to the causeway  ill get you the address  good luck mikey  santora hey  lets take a walk  listen listen you dont want to do this  this  i could tell you more  i could tell you about flowers and the plan  man you dont want to do this  i know plenty already  i mean why shut this down  theres money to be made here man  ii could help you we could split it 5050   laughing  oh yeah   sobbing  i dont want to die man  please  please im begging you   grunting    grunting stops    coughs    tires squeal   he got away  what the hell are you talking about  wheres my gun  he took it  hes got my gun we got to find him now  could he be going to meet up with jimmy  i dont know maybe  and you told jimmy to stay put with the kid  yeah wheres the house  we dont have time for this wheres the house  hibiscus island  what address  i got to

this is officer finley uh miami pd  id like to know if youve seen anyone  go to 1313 prospect street  uh theres someone going there right now   dialing   fi i got the address   tires screech    gun cocks   people underestimate the tactical importance of tv  in urban warfare  guard dutys boring and a ballgame passes the time better  than say looking for intruders  more battles have been decided by pennant races  than people imagine   muffled shouting   fiona brandon  were gonna take you back to your mom and dad okay  santora the junkies here  we do him and jimmy first then the kid  okay you cut through the backyard  ill cover you from the front  okay  have fun in there you son of a bitch  look whos here   indistinct tv chatter   you thought you could steal from me  what the hell are you saying wheres the kid  i said wheres the kid  i dont know he was just there  i know what you did jimmy  i know youre flowers i know everything  i dont know what youre talking about get that thing out of my face  put it down now you picked the wrong guy to doublecross  i did everything you ever said you sold me out to a junkie  its always best to have business arguments unarmed  when tempers are high and everyones got a gun  you never know whats going to set someone off   gunshot    gunshots   jimmy jimmy dont   gunshots   i dont know what to say  you dont have to say anything  think about leaving miami  you dont want to be around if santoras friends come looking  oh we werent planning to be  weve uh talked about making a fresh start  somewhere else together  patricia thank you  for everything  you ready   chuckles   a fresh starttogether  kind of inspiring dont you think  id settle for staying out of jail  come on fi we got a date  with the storage unit   indistinct radio chatter   when a front door is being watched  your best option oftentimes is just to make a back door  if you dont mind getting damp  a water saw is a great tool for the job  it will cut through the wall  much more quietly than a metal saw  and wont ignite anything flammable  that happens to be lying around  hey detective uh would you like to come in  i have some more receipts  cute  you know i finally did get a look at that storage unit  that didnt belong to you  find anything interesting  yeah i found a hole in the back of the wall  and a puddle of water inside  yeah the heavy rains the
