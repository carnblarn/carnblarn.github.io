congressional candidate regina bookman  are they really talking about that woman  making political hay out of the wheat field  that is the nbckabletown merger  who wrote this jared honestly  bookman told reporters quote  the merger of nbc and kabletown is bad for the consumer  i dont trust their executive leadership  and kabletown still has an auxiliary button  on their remote  what is that for  it just makes the screen go blue  why is she still talking about the merger  she said i had three months to make nbc more diverse  its not your fault nobody watched  americas next top black guy  bookman amping up the rhetoric in a tight race  polls have her in a dead heat  with outofnowhere challenger steven austin  wait a second theres a chance she could lose  bookman is obviously holding a gun to my head  and no matter what i do she obviously wants me to fail  but if she loses this isnt a conversation  but if she loses  i wont have to worry about her scuttling the merger  jonathan get her opponent in here  whoever he is he just made a very powerful friend  i thought you said you didnt need any more friends  zing legtubes liz  vunderhinder  theyre from brooklyn without limits  its this very cool store with locations in gay town  white harlem and the van beardswick section of brooklyn  and they dont just look great see the tag  handmade in usa  because bwl is all about fair trade  and local artisans and staying green  these jeans totally make up  for all the times i took a long hot shower because i was bored  im so excited for you liz  now we both have amazing butts  make that all three of us jenna a word  specifically the word talking  oh and look at this  jtrain as you may know i was in a film  called hard to watch  and the pundits think i have a chance  at an oscar and i just learned about air quotes  yes i talked about your movie  with my therapist last week for 20 hours  i know this is difficult for you  im fine  talking with dr linda helped me realize  i have just as much going on in my life  my exercise video is dropping soon  its called jenna gets hard  well if youre okay talking about it i need your help  these reporters want to come do a story on me  theyre from something called  the hollywood foreign press association  hofpa   yeah  thats the golden globes  the secondmostimportant awards in hollywood  after the peoples choice awards  where the fans are in charge  so what do you think i should do  you could have a special screening for them host a luncheon  and when the time is right be bad at snapping got it  no tracy you could try to bribe them  i mean a golden globe is a stepping stone to an oscar  how bad do you want it  im not an expert at morality but isnt that wrong  youre asking me  so this is the man whos gonna bring down regina bookman  rhode islands own steven austin  actually i go by steve austin  that way people see my name on ballots  they think im the wrestler and they vote for me  ive been reading up on you steve  honestly i want to like you  but i see that youre not affiliated with the republican party  the party system is broken jack  i dont believe in parties  i dont join em and i never get invited to emhint hint  youre an individual  a maverick  people like you are succeeding  because americans are fed up with the status quo  exactly  theyre tired of the direction this countrys headed in  they want to return to our past glory  they want an american renaissance  i like what im hearing steve  then youre gonna love the sound of this  goo goo gaa gaa jack  whats that  thats the theme of my campaign  renaissance means rebirth  i want to usher in the rebirth of this country  thats why the theme of all my campaign commercials  is im a baby  this country has lost its way  we need to start over and return to what made our nation great  my name is steve austin  and im a lifelong resident of rhode island  and the manager of a local paintball facility  i will clean out washington  like its the bathroom of a paintball facility  vote steve austin  and if youre blind i am the wrestler  right  i like a lot of what youre saying steve  but before i throw my support behind you  i do have a litmus test  okay can i take that in two weeks  no its just questions  what do you think the role of the government should be  limited i believe in small government   excellent answer  or no government at all  if it works in antarctica why cant it work here  but if we have to have government make it as small as possible  dwarves tiny buildings pizza bagels for lunch  maybe we should stop at small government  lets cut to the chase  i need you to assure me you would never allow the government  to interfere with the sale of one company to another  of course not the government shouldnt interfere in anything  what happens inside a mans own rain poncho  at a minor league baseball game is his own business  well steve we should stop talking before i change my mind  but i do want to host a fundraiser for you  so give me a couple of days to put that together  i need to know that you believe in my message jack  take the rattle  say goo goo gaa gaa jack  goo goo gaa gaa  whats going on here  im helping tracy plan for a golden globes event tomorrow  kenneth is our human sushi platter  and im doing a dry run so everything will be perfect  for my friend tracy  lying perfectly still reminds me of hiding  under our porch during a hill people rampage  on the day kenneths mouth will be filled with wasabi  so he dont do so much  i should get a chafing dish and fill it with my underwear  in case some saudi guys show up  let me get this straight  you the person who is still jealous  of the attention baby jessica got  are helping tracy win an award for acting  oh im helping him all right  i even gave him the idea to try to bribe them  and hes gonna do that thats awful  i trust award shows  they tell me how much to care about different dead people  its not gonna work  if they could be bribed i would have won a golden globe  for my lifetime original movie sister can you spare a breast  so youve tried this before  and they were so offended they banned me for life  and the same thing will happen to tracy  so youre sabotaging him  just like i did to my niece when she tried to sing  at our familys christmas party  you know what you and tracy deserve each other  i dont know which of you to be more disappointed in  me silly  im more aware of what im doing  im sorry miss  do you know where liz lemon good god  lemon those jeans make you look like a mexican sports

business is whats screwing up this country  please lemon you work for general electric  technically i am a freelancer  which is pretty much a modernday cowboy  and i live like a cowboy by buying quality locally made jeans  also by eating beans out of a can due to impatience  youre on your own here partner  but hey its not all bad cause you get to watch me walk away  no no thats not right  why

therell be no boobies  then bam boobies  tracy what is an actor  i think the better question is what isnt an actor  a lamp a couch that mirror  or a hidden pistol  an actor  and now amidst a day of wonders one wonder more  a special votersonly screening of hard to watch  based on the book stone cold bummer by manipulate  they call new york the big apple  never seemed that way to me  i used to have dreams  i was an allcity running back  and i was gonna run out of here to college the suburbs  now the only thing i use a football for is as a toilet  funny thing to happen to a guy named lucky    i am a constitutional originalist  and i believe that our founding fathers had it right  we need to get back to their america  no paved roads  rum used as an anesthetic  legalized slavery  all right some good pieces  jack you want to see my hand gestures  i have you listen to me  forceful conclusion  theres work to be done  hand me that shovel so i can dig a grave for her  okay lets cut  sir look at this bookman photo op  representative bookman greets young voters at warwick mall  shes courting the youth vote that means shes desperate  my generation never votes  it interferes with talking about ourselves all the time  shes running scared god this could work  now all i have to do is whip austin into shape  hey jack just to have options  should we do a couple takes with binky   lets take

themselves with a surplus  of canvas waterboarding hoods  so they had sweatshops make them into messenger bags  to sell to outerborough idiots  you dont know what youre talking about  handmade in usa  your magic jeans are from bwl  oh lemon its not handmade in usa  its pronounced hondmade in oosa  the hond people are a vietnamese slave tribe  and usa is their island prison  they made your jeans  you know how they get the stitching so small  orphans  no brooklyn zack is real  he just got back from peru where he met a family  thats been making hats for 2000 years  we all make our compromises  at least im doing it for our company for jobs  youre doing it for your ass  i dont believe you  the liberal media would have told me about this  theres no such thing  the new york times is owned by  nyt incorporated  which is owned by altheon ballistic dynamics  which is owned by the murdoch family  who are owned by halliburton  it goes all the way to the top  how can you work here  do you know who owns this place  halliburton bitch so what  but look at you  youre meticulously groomed and  and you turned a tie into a belt  oh so gay men cant be conservative  youre so norant thats short for ignorant  thats short for ignorant  and who are you to judge  youre still wearing those jeans  ahche guevara if only you knew what this place stood for  his great grandfather was domingo halliburton  wow  i havent seen so many suits since my trial  i have an idea i know these people so let me do the talking  oh uh steve  of course you know ed perlman  perlman isnt that last name jew  new strategy

deshawns place  cause hes my brother  dont say nothin  sometimes you gotta do the right thing  even when the wrong thing is a whole lot easier  now lets just have one last happy dinner together  as a

well you were right about brooklyn without limits  crunchy on the outside rightwing nut job on the inside  like anne coulters underwear  but i see youre still wearing the jeans  i know they look so good  and im skyping later with carol and we like to dance together  and i want to do this back it up move  that i havent been able to pull off since high school  its like back it up back it up   and drop it like its hot   drop it like its hot   i will haunt your dreams   so fine im selling out but so are you  no i believe in steve austin  and his plan to put a casino on the moon  then i believe in halliburton  good so neither of us should feel guilty  we dont  sabotage but im the one who does that to me  i know tracy it was wrong  but i couldnt go through with it because i saw your movie  and i cant believe im saying this but youre great  wait great like good  or grate like the thing i dropped my asthma inhaler down  the other day  the first one tray  you are going to win  and when you do ill be furious  like waking up next to rob schneider furious  but i dont care  its like you said in the movie  sometimes you gotta do the right thing  even when the wrong thing would be a whole lot easier  no dont say that  in real life you have to make compromises  no liz lemon its like the thing i said  in another movie i made  compromises are for lesser souls  die werewolf zombie  so you two have decided to do the right thing  ugh fine  ill go home and change  take a last look guys   i would hit that  too small  i believe we are all being held in slavery by big government  lesbian mario brothers  i couldnt do it jack  i just couldnt support bwl  and id already thrown out all my other jeans  that is the most unflattering item of clothing  i have ever seen you wear  and im including 2008s turtleneck with smileyface vest  but i feel good and not just because  in my shorteralls i found a bag of tastetations  a discontinued chocolate hard candy  but because sometimes you gotta do the right thing  even when the wrong thing would be a whole lot easier  die werewolf zombie  good god lemon  i will never allow casinos on the moon  thank you   steve  friend or foe  youre the reason everyone came here tonight  they need to hear you speak  in person  from the heart  damn you shorteralls  americans are a simple but powerful people  which is why i have written a new national anthem  ooga booga big   ooga booga strong   i am going to sing my ooga booga song   ooga booga big   ooga booga strong   wow thats worse than the speech my grandpa made  when my cousin married a japanese girl  as if that werent enough austin was mocked  in jay lenos monologue tonight  the kingmaker has spoken its over  bookman will be reelected  but you did the right thing  and at the end of the day  isnt that more important than some merger  letting morality get in the way of making money  i might as well go and be a teacher  i know what will cheer you up  would you like some cake  yeah  cake boy  this has been the best day of my life   i believe ketchup bottles should be 500 larger  we are all responsible for heroes becoming terrible  but what kind of jail are these alien prisoners being held in  we should bring back slavery  and theyre backed by big corporations  animals can govern themselves  taken out of context it was exactly what i meant  as god is my witness we will build casinos on the moon
