                1 it doesnt matter how long youve lived in new york  its still fun to look up  and pretend all the buildings are giant severed robot penises  be quiet lemon  its happening  wow  out with ge in with kabletown  it seems like one of us should sing the circle game right now   now its on to phase two  im like keats stout cortez  staring at the pacific with a wild surmise  and daring to imagine what  new planets might swim into my ken  so will we be getting new employee ids  cause id really like to retake my photo  good god what happened  i was holding in a snart  and then right when she took the photo  dont you want to know what a snart is  i can tell you now its 1000    ugh  fyi tracys phoning it in today  what else is new  no mother literally  are you also staying at this hotel  line  tracy we have been playing this game  for five years now   when is it ever gonna stop  i dont know  after i win a bunch of awards for my movie  its not gonna get better  i dont see how it could get any worse  good question liz lemon  when you win an oscar it opens up  an elite level of actor craziness  throwing telephones at hotel employees  speaking to the un about some messedup crap in africa  and im definitely getting a private island  youre getting an island  every crazy alister owns an island  nicholas cage  celine dion charles widmore  this is a whole new world in front of me ll  im like stout cortez  hes my gardener hes easily amazed  you have two choices here  either you can stay in your room like a child  or you can get out there and do your job  thank you  oh im sorry that was misleading  im not gonna rehearse  im gonna get a sandwich and then eat it on the toilet   what are you wearing  my nbc page dress blues  i want to look good in case i get on camera  on what camera  well mrs jordans reality show  is gonna be following mr jordan around while hes at work   what  i know  isnt it exciting  ive never been on tv before  i hope i photograph okay  because when i look into a mirror  theres just a white haze  who told tracy he could bring cameras here  well mr donaghy uh here  i couldnt put the memo in your mailbox  cause its full of unread adoption materials  yeah  hey are the reality cams here  oh god lutz why  what i dont want tush lines  oh  you know  i have enough problems with tracy  i dont need cameras following him around while hes here  do you know what pays for your show lemon  our product placement with sullivan psychiatric clinic  sullivan psychiatric  youll drool over our crazy prices  reality tv  a woman with hundruplets a live execution  the real transvestite hoarders of orange county penitentiary  ugh that show is upsetting  why does the warden let lady extravaganza  have so many spoons  programs like that are the lifeblood of this industry  theyre cheap promotable  and even if theyre terrible  you get a rating and move on to the next idea  everybody wins  well i happen to think  we are in a new golden age of scripted television  shh shh  lemon its okay  as i begin phase two of my jack attack on kabletown  ive been doing some research  do you know what the most successful reality events  of the past five years are  celebrity benefits for natural disasters  the viewership is huge  yes but those ratings mean nothing  all the networks air those benefits at the same time  so no one gets an advantage  true unless only one network is carrying it  because only one network is ready to broadcast  a benefit on the night of the disaster  but thats impossible  theres not enough time to put it together  unless youve pretaped the show beforehand  and filmed options for every possible disaster scenario  youre going to pretape a benefit  for a disaster that hasnt happened yet   yeah  that is bad karma jack  i mean this morning i stole a cab  from a pregnant lady on crutches  and i am just waiting  uh my goodness lemon  the people affected will still get money  but so will nbc  everybody wins  oh and i need jenna to sing  ill do it  but i hate my dress  all right listen up everybody  i need ideas from you people  for potential natural disasters  anything that might require a televised celebrity benefit  i need something new  and i need it by the end of the day  so  lets get to work  well i just finished a screenplay  where a tidal wave destroys washington  someone write down tidal wave shut him up  what about a tornado that hits a handgun factory  and its just spinning around shooting handguns  what happens when the second flood comes  and you arent allowed on reverend garys ark  especially since reverend gary made it clear  the ark is just for teenage boys  you know with global weirding and everything  stuff like that could totally happen here  there was a cyclone in brooklyn last year  it destroyed two vintagetshirt stores and a banjo  if something does happen  itll probably be while were at work  i mean this is where we spend all of our time  we should have a plan in place  if we dont i will freak out  and start karatekicking people  everyone needs an emergency plan  for instance right before the ark leaves  im supposed to castrate reverend gary  i see you finally decided to come to work  of course  im just continuing  my consistent professional behavior  lets laugh together friend   whats going on with him  first of all good morning  and to answer your question its angies cameras  these reality shows want crazy behavior  so tracys keeping it boring  give them nothing that could make him look bad  since when does tracy care about looking bad  since he got nominated for an oscar  then once he wins its on to the next level  which i am not looking forward to  that island he wants to buy is filled with scorpions  lets do it again from the top  i want to get it perfect  because perfection is my middle name  unclaimed perfection baby boy  so heres the plan  if anything happens we meet outside under the atlas statue  walk to the 59th street bridge  and try to get to my moms house in queens  okay good  weve got a wide skill set  for any postapocalyptic scenario  im good at archery and kind of want to die  i can use my glasses to start a fire  toofer can get us through black gay  and nerdcontrolled neighborhoods  cerie will be some sort of queen in the new society  i will do sex with cannibals as needed  i can talk to animals  well not talk to em  i can take commands from em  huh lutz what can he do  well hes slow and a coward  im not useless  i mean ive got a car  oh i didnt know that  all right lutz is the driver  wwait how big is your car   can it fit all of us  oh right  its actually pretty small  i could only take three of you  so ill have to choose  that sucks  its like a reality show where you guys get to compete  for a seat in my car by proving how much you like me  tracy i need you to do something  of course friend  teamwork is the key to success  yeah  you need to stay late for a wardrobe fitting tonight  it should take about two hours  okay  no problem  after that i need you to record that dvd commentary  that youve been putting off for five years  hope you didnt have plans tonight  no i wasnt gonna buy two blimps  and crash them into each other to see what sound they made  look is there anything that you two could maybe fight about  an argument that culminates in a racial slur would be lovely  sorry this is gonna be nice and boring  tracys even going to agree to attend a fundraiser  for my cousins dance studio  arent you tracy  so were good  never better  im as happy as a clam that wants to kill some woman  great youre the best  love you  love you more  boy ii dont know jack this just doesnt feel right  bob its for charity  and if you dont do it ill have msnbc tell the world  you grew up in england  but im so identified with new york  you bloody tosser  bob  okay  disaster options take one  well always remember where we were  when we heard that tornado had hit a handgun factory  two days ago when people thought of a mudslide  they just thought of getting drunk in an applebees  but now we know it as the thing that destroyed denver  when the birds first started attacking us  we all thought it was pretty funny and made hitchcock jokes  but were not laughing now  because our laughter excites the birds sexually  this devastating wildfire  this horrible flood  this wonderful flood  that put out that devastating wildfire  these superintelligent sharks  tracy i just thought  of a few more things i need from you  shut your mouth   i am finished taking orders from you   and i think that youre a foureyed douche   wow tracy i dont want to interrupt this moment  this is great stuff but thats billy joels  anything you sing to that tune uh  i cant use on the show  thats too bad   but if i say you cannot do anything   to make me look bad on your tv show   and also let me say that liz is a ho   a dirty ho   you are a child   and youre losing your miiind   i want to kick you   im not good at making up songs   unlike me who is good   as you can tell from this rhyme   whoa oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh oh oh   whoa oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh   oh oh oh oh oh   the thing that happened   was so sad   we cant believe it got so bad   when the stuff we know occurred   went down   so find it in your heart   step up and do your part   and help the people the thing that happened   happened to   help the people   the thing that happened   happened to   fantastic jenna you really brought  the songwriting computers words to life  wow youre actually doing this  yes all im missing is the disaster  well im in the middle of a tracy disaster  i thought i could use angies cameras  to make him behave but he found a loophole  and now to close it i need 80000  to buy the rights to uptown girl  lemon it sounds like  youre trying to fight crazy with crazy  yeah because crazy is the only language  that tracy is fluent in  but youll never outcrazy tracy  so why dont you have it out with him  once and for all like two adults  because were not two adults jack  one of us is an actor and actors are not people  someone get a pa to feed me baby food  or i will drop a d in the green room  yeah  last week you thought i was crying wolf didnt you  lutz is the best   nice feet lutz  i like lutz the most  look at all of you trying to impress me  i feel like the bachelor  but uh whom shall i give my rose  its so hard to choose when everyone loves me so much  but only three of you can ride to safety in my car  mmm  i dont really have a car  tracy your little singing game is over  i got autotune for my computer  and if you try to sing ill just take out the melody  and no one has to pay for that  liz lemon won   do do do do   that was me singing the beatles here comes the sun  for

life harder at every turn  you are late you blow off rehearsals  and your online romance prank was not funny  i fell in love with you  you wore a yellow hat to that coffee shop  you know whats

you made me leave in the lobby  all you do is stifle me when you should be thanking me  oh yeah i should be thanking you  without me do you have any idea where you would be right now  this honky

actually craft stories  and when the story doesnt have an ending you dont just create one out of thin air  by playing music or having people give each other meaningful looks  sure that might manipulate the audience  into thinking theyre feeling something but it sucks  tell me what you want from me   something that were like those years   im sick of all the insincere   so im gonna give all my secrets away
