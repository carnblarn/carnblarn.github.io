loves a dude in a dress  i mean those are the best bugs bunnies  frank there are large pockets of africanamerican culture  that  caucasians know nothing about  the stigma of drag is one of them  whatever  ive played a woman before   hunky grandma be trippin made 96 million  all im saying is is drag is a way for caucasians  to emasculate you and make you seem nonthreatening  we never would have stooped so low on black frasier  black frasier  niles this beaujolais is impeccable  its both fruity and precocious  thats not the only thing around here thats fruity and precocious  i never heard of black frasier  what  it was huge on bet  every thursday night at about 900 or 915  think about it tracy  all the best africanamerican comedians refuse to do drag  chris rock doesnt do it dr

flip wilson  whoopi goldberg does it every day  you stole a franchise from me  shamanda could have been a movie  okay you need to write something great for him  before this becomes a problem  i

anybody tonight  but you and i have so much in common  also you have really pretty eyes oh hi  i learned the truth at seventeen that love was meant for beauty queens  hey youre bumming us out  and high school girls with clear skin smiles  who married young and then retired  whoa  i thought bars were open till 400  nope 1130 lets get you to bed   from human resources  hi  he told me that toofer filed the harassment complaint against tracy  what  now i have to attend  sensitivity training  what seems to be the problem toofer  mr jordan called me the nword  and  and i was really offended  because  because its a racial slur  brothers talk to other brothers like that  i was being friendly    yes toofer  you see in the last decade or so the africanamerican community  has reappropriated that word as a way of depriving it of its meaning  just dont try to tell my girlfriend that  yeah toofer i really dont think tracy was trying to offend you  its okay for us to use it with each other  you can call me that its a term of endearment  look im not trying to cause any trouble  and i confess i appreciate what you do for the show  i want you to be my brother my homeboy my n  whoa  this meeting is adjourned  no cool homie  you might as well spread me down with a fire hose  just sounds so hateful coming from you ugh  i wish to file a complaint  hey  dennis what are you doing here  hey im moving into my new apartment  so i got one last thing to say to you  and then ill be out of your life forever  dear liz lemon  while other women have bigger boobs than you  no woman has as big a heart  when i saw you getting ready to go out  and get nailed by a bunch of guys last night  i knew for sure it was over between us  and for the first time since the 86 world series i cried  i cried like a big dumb homo  and if it was up to me we would be together forever  but theres a new thing called womens liberation  which gives you women the right to choose  and you have chosen to abort me  and that i must live with  so tonight when you arrive home ill be gone  i officially renounced my squatters rights  ill always love you  goodbye and good luck  ill never forget you  and that is why we are no longer a couple  the guy just came in here and bared his soul to you  what are you made of stone  am i crazy the guys a disaster right  well i dont know  i mean yeah hes a little bridge and tunnel  but you did say you had some good times  no no no he had his bad moments too  hey  threesome  how about it huh  mmm  im just saying  after last night  maybe hes not such a bad choice  you are suggesting that i get back with dennis  maybe  look youre a writer  write a list of dennis pros and cons  its a very helpful exercise  its how i decided to get a scooter instead of a bike  ah  well you have to admit theres always time for tony blair  theres always time for bashar alassad  but theres never any time for jack donaghy and thats a problem  go ahead take the call yeah  hey dennis you drop by to say hi to liz  you mean the exfuture mrs dennis  she dumped me again  im sorry to hear that  yeah you know you try to make some people happy but it doesnt work all the time  tell me about

traveling its a headache  who needs that  thats why im always dating 20yearolds  nah let me tell you about  half of them are 16 you want some advice  its hard for alpha males like you and me to put our egos aside  but if shes worth it you make it work  its like my cousin teddys dog  sometimes he just doesnt wanna lick my feet  so what i do is i hide my feet from him for a couple of days  and then when he sees them he goes bananas  so jack in this example liz is the dog  and i am my feet  you see what im saying  yes i believe i do  each of you is here because you are insensitive to a coworker okay  you mightve used one of the words i call the uhoh words  such as slut  ho  uh bitch  biyatch  queerburger  faggotron  gaybird  uh the word for black in any language  nro noir schwartz
