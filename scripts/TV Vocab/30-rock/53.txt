the times were groovy  i can offer you two weeks severance  mr donaghy i know you said only interrupt you if it was very important  but tashonda from time warner cable is on the phone  and shes offering three free months of showtime  but we have to act now  kenneth this does not qualify as something important  i do not want showtime  oh okay im sorry  i just didnt want you to miss out on

pertaining to  the tgs budget  oh my that sounds very important   mr donaghy  kenneth  ive worked here 20 years  i was wrong that was not important enough  its me kenneth the page this job is hard  please have a seat mr donaghy will be right with you  do you know what these meetings are about  i hear people are getting fired  yeah i dont know   do you know jack donaghy well  pretty well  do you

already cut the exterminators  jenna something weird is going on  you mean this budget stuff dont worry about it tracy  its just gonna affect the nonspecials  no its not that  jenna youre the smartest person i know  you think kenneth could be a murderer  what why would you think that  well i might be crazy  but neither he nor his bird would let me into his bedroom  and why wouldnt you want to let tracy jordan into your bedroom  unless you got a bunch of dead nurses in there  well i had to study serial killers to prepare for my role as criminal profiler jill st ferrari  in the lifetime original miniseries hushed rapings  and all masked murderers share three characteristics  cruelty to animals   he grew up killing pigs  bedwetting  no wonder hes fascinated when i do that  and an inability to read human facial queues  i admonished him for that earlier  three for three hes a monster  okay weve gotta go tell jack  you know if kenneth is actually a killer were gonna be heroes  liz our food is gone they took it  it happened this morning  do you have a cookie mommys baby needs his yumyums  oh my god sid did you get fired  goodbye lerz   liz its a massacre  what is going on  brad came in this

kenneth  i meanill tell you his name  its kenneth  excellent   i will be sure to let him know as soon as hes done firing steven lee from microwaves  what  oh mr lee i forgot hes ready for you now  ive

creepy  jenna i just want you to know that if we find any human remains in there  im gonna throw up all over your face  oh no  kenneths a murderer and the riddlers coming  no its a bug bomb get out get out   its poisonous ah  ah  so thanks for dinner   you sure know a lot about sushi  well you gotta be careful  they try to upsell you the real crab   so  so  list i gotta get going i got a lotta work tomorrow  all right listen were both adults here  we know the deal lets cut to the chase  thats certainly direct  we go upstairs20 minutes open mouthi will work your ears  i dont know liz what youre asking me to do is a big deal  if i go through with this i need to know its worth it  fine 30 minutes ill make some sounds  and you can say one weird thing to me  all right hardball  top front of my body is now in play deal  deal  lemon i heard a rumor that you went out with one of the consultants last night  well i had no choice  i had to give him a little taste of the lemon  and it was not sour my friend not sour  its interesting you put it that way  because your writers room is now the headquarters  for telemundos coverage of world cup soccer qualifying  equador tiene que ganar o atar contra peru  para avanzar en los finales   what the what  ssh  brad and i had a deal i gave him top front  top front good lord lemon thats your worst quadrant  kenneth you know how you told tracy not to into your bedroom  well naturally we assumed you were a serial killer  and as you can imagine your bird is dead  yeah but on the bright side  youve been downgraded from suspect to person of interest  some day were gonna look back on this and laugh  time does heal all wounds  now you wait just one minute  i am sorry to be using my barn voice in front of a lady but i am riled up  it is not enough that you killed the bird ive had for almost 60 years  but the fact that you didnt trust me is unforgivable  but whd i expect  look at you two walking around without a care in the world  as budgets are slashed  and people keep getting called into mr donaghys office to be fired  i may just be a nonspecial  but what you two did is inexcusable  good day  im out of lettersi have to return my kids braces  what did you do we trusted you  you ruined it with your talking didnt you  hey  why are you still messing with my show  what about last night  liz last night was what it was but business is business  right and last night i gave you the business  we had an agreement top front and some light ear work  you got your quid halst wheres my quo  oh my god  last night was about the show  oh please you know it was  you were all oh its gotta be worth it  and what youre asking me to do is such a big deal  it was a big deal  being with a woman for the first time since my wife died   ah snap  it was just a transaction  what kind of person are you  does it help if i tell you i thought we were doing sexual espionage  oh god  sharon angel  i swore to you the next one would be worthy but shes not  shes a monster  marissa add dr walters to my sched  lets go lets go lets go  okay  so mr halster has filed a complaint against you with human resources  specifically his claim suggests that you tried to barter sex in exchange for professional consideration  in the human resource world we refer to that as being a filthy prostitute  now since this is your first incident  and uh mr donaghy has explained the mitigating circumstances  im convinced that this sexual outburst was brought on by menopause  we are recommending only a twoweek suspension without pay  okay thats fair  and obviously mr halster cannot function in this hostile work environment  his company has reassigned him  and your budget review process will start over again under my supervision   really  yes really  i hope youve learned your lesson miss lemon  when you harass sexually in the workplace  things do not somehow just work out in the end  mr donaghy i thought youd like to know that theres a spider on the printer  oh no am i interrupting  is this another firing meeting  it is now  kenneth have a seat  ken we feel bad that we but mostly jennagassed your bird  i agree  not to name names but its so sad that a certain black individual found it necessary  to trick someone so pretty into believing you were a murderer  im sorry is there a point to all this  ive had a bad couple of days  well we feel terrible about what happened  so we did a little something to make it up to you  looks like ive got some naming to do  pat balthazar donna  lorne michael
