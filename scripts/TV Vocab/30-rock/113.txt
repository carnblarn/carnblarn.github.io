so it definitely doesnt matter  this isnt the last we will be seeing of brock  well whoever wins its a great night for the industry  kidz is a hit the whole family can watch together  not your usual sitcom crap full of gratuitous vulgarity  and pratfalls  wah oh  oh my penis  jenna this is a big night  and ive got something big planned  tonight during the finalists duet  im gonna cry  now of course none of these little condom accidents  could actually make me cry so im gonna rub this  under my eyes to help me fake it  its an old acting trick i learned  from glenn becks prostitute  well mark my words jenna  tonight is going to be the greatest  disaster in the history of television  the young contestants apparently inebriated on live tv  oh shushanna  i gotta throw up  vomits  what happened  why havent you been returning my calls  because my phone melted last night lemon  come here jack  mm  that was my angriest hug cause thats how i feel right now  instead of heading back to philadelphia  im going down to deal with the fcc  the federal clown commission  i hope that comes off as respectful  my father was a clown  and i know how hard those men work  im going to get to the bottom  of what happened last night sir  ive already detained brock and ava under the patriot act  people have forgotten about that thing  but any white male can arrest any other person  knocks hello peers  sure has been a busy morning  down in the standards department  because of last nights clusterwhoops  darren was fired  then he threatened to come back with a gun  then i got a promotion  and the desk closest to the door  here are my new business cards  late night programming so youre covering tgs now  and a wonderful new show from dl hughley  thats already been canceled  i feel like oscar the grouch today  and not just cause i woke up  in a garbage can this morning  startling someone named gordon  whats wrong tracy  i cant eat for 24 hours  cause i have a colonoscopy tomorrow  im starving  you know fasting can actually clear your mind  in college i once went on a hunger strike   to protest apartheid  oh  youre the one who solved that thank you so much  what are you doing here  what jenna  save it liz  yes i was disappointed that i didnt get to do my fake cry  but i do have a plan b  the whole point of the cry was to humanize me  to change public perception  but what else humanizes a monster  motherhood  oh god dont adopt  that child is better off in somalia  it could be a pirate or a warlords concubine  this is better than adopting  remember my little moneymaking scheme back in chicago  cashing your dead aunts social security checks  oh no im still doing that  im talking about when i donated my eggs  so a couple of months ago i called  the calumet city egg donation center and house of blues  to see if there were any little jennas out there  who wanted to meet me  hang on are you saying you have a kid  no i dont  oh  i have six kids  jerome share the bronzer you slut  scoffs  dear god  exciting jazz music    s06 ep 11  standards and practices   im a very powerful man brock  little league tryouts are coming soon  how would you like to wind up on a team with  none of your friends  it was her idea she made me do it  brock just sold you out ava  snaps  what are you doing to molly  she already had to live through world war ii  brock said it was all your idea  no it was her idea  shes just so cool  like a human silly band  who whos a human silly band  im tall enough now  that there isnt a roller coaster in the world  i cant go on   wow  so  you

interview tonight  for barbara walters 10 most overexposed people  oh barbara walters excited chattering  okay so let me just quickly identify everyones good sides  left left right  right left  oh judy thats not really on message  look i didnt call the donation center  to be on tv jenna  i wanted to go get a cup of coffee and get to know you  if you want to get to know me  read my 2006 interview in amtrak magazine  if you want to be my daughter put on this wig and smile  oh there you are liierz gurgles  boy i am still not comfortable calling you by your first name  then again youve never been comfortable  calling me by my full christian name  kenneth  oh no kenneth is short for andromakennethamblesorton   so whats up  oh  wait what is this  additional restrictions to broadcast standards  yes  people are pretty upset about last night  how can we do fart doctor without the word fart  im surprised they allow you to say doctor  its so close to gynecologist which is disgusting  have you seen this memo from standards  kenneth is being a real dingbat  which is now the harshest word we are allowed to say  oh you can blame that on kaylie hooper  shes the one who ruined the kidz finale  really what a dingbat  why didnt i see this coming  i knew this company was making me lose my edge  thats why i hired a cato to attack me at random  like inspector clouseau  cato  dont attack me tonight okay  i know i told you that when i say dont attack me  thats when i most need you to attack me  but im serious  cato  aah  excellent cato excellent  did kaylie really think i wouldnt figure this out  no she knew i would  so shes going to be ready for me  good i like a fair fight  okay she is just a teenage girl  lemon you know very well that a nemesis can be anyone  or anything  sighs  autocorrect  i was trying to say pen organizer  oh god youre a winter  i dont know what that means  why are there only six chairs out there theres seven of us  oh no one of us will have to sit out the interview  im just gonna choose at random who its gonna be  eeniemeeniemineymoe out goes you   im sorry judy  bye judy  all condescending goodbyes  couldve just gotten another chair  knocks on door  who is it  sweetie its poppop  i came back from dc early and i lost my darn key  chuckles what a world  surprise  deniro impression im very good at voices kaylie  im very good  i know what you did  and you had to assume id break brock and ava  so youre ready for this  but heres what you werent counting on  this has nothing to do with you  i just had to get poppop out of town  because i am in so much trouble  henry and his friends had to go to the king of prussia mall  last thursday night cause it was a half day  and i couldnt go cause i had piano  and my friend vickie well  she said she got grounded cause she went  to some highlighter party with dylan  while his parents were out of town  whoa okay hang on calm down  and then fat vickie saw her there  so i called her and henry answered her phone  because he had vickies phone  wait which vickie fat vickie  vickie p are you even listening to me   okay  god  vickie used to be my best friend  i had her youface password so i logged onto her account  and posted all these photos  with i am a slut written on her forehead  and then school found out so now my life is over  please  what does this have to do with sabotaging me  this has nothing to do with you  i messed up the show to make sure  poppop wouldnt come back to philadelphia with me  cause dr melvoin is trying to kick me out of school  and if poppop comes to the teacher conference  well then hell let them expel me  and ill have to go to some school in the middle of nowhere  and then i might as well be dead  wait where are your parents  who knows  my mom is in indonesia visiting her charity  where poor children make shoes  isnt that just a sweat shop  i know  and then my dad put a porsche engine in a model   and drove it to mardi gras  i know what its like not to have your parents around  i once took a log with googly eyes  to a fatherson picnic  but uh whos going to take you  to this parentteacher conference  i dont know  i have nobody  i wanna die  screams  do you have a second kenneth  no theres only one of me what what are you asking  look we have a show tonight  you cant just take away all these words  weve been using for the past six years  oh that reminds me  you cant say using on tv it implies drug use  were saying whatever we want  no you cant  thats an order  i stole that speech from an episode jag  but it applies here  are you kidding me  last week you were a page  now youre telling me how to run my show  well i am arguing back at you  i have enough crap to deal with around here kenneth  im interrupting you cause im good at arguing  i dont need you to make my life worse  i am responding i am matching your tone  and making my own point  you know what kenneth fine you win  but as we saw the other night on kidz  anything can happen on live tv   right tracy  what  im just saying tray  youre very unpredictable  and well write clean sketches  but you might just do your standup act   who knows  okay  im still fasting because i misread my calendar  tomorrow is my colonoscopy  today was my meeting with colin oscopy  therefore i have no idea  what youre saying talking turkey leg  were you a difficult teenager  well i was voted head of the pta so no  im accustomed to dealing with difficult people lemon  but teenage girls ugh  are a puzzle  oh yes how was your meeting with your nemesis  i volunteered to accompany kaylie  to a parentteacher conference at her school   what why  its complicated  the point is and i never thought id say this  i actually feel badly for kaylie  on the other hand i know full well  that this is an opportunity to destroy her  i could get her expelled  sent off to some secondrate boarding school  then on to that last bastion of the incompetent rich  usc  i dont know jack you should stay out of this  no i could help this girl  or destroy this monster  if i could just tell whether shes vicious or vulnerable  thats the problem shes a teenage girl  shes vicious and vulnerable  she might be completely lying  like when i was 15 and told everyone at my school  that id already gotten my period  or she could be in real trouble  like when i was 17 and finally got my period  at a very loosely supervised petting zoo  once again lemon i leave your office  more confused than when i entered  but having glimpsed yet another tile in the rich mosaic  that is your menstrual history  so bravo wants to do a reality show about us  and i thought the opening credits  could be all of us in a giant dog bed  and you guys are suckling  on prosthetic dog teats that im wearing  actually we had a different idea  now that judys gone  its kind of obvious someone is the odd person out  its jerome right  i didnt want to say anything  cause i was trying to be a good mother  but youre cheesy and everyone hates you  no jenna you  youre so much older than the rest of us  so were thinking the show is more like  the girls next door  and youre that old boat captain that shows up sometimes  thats hugh hefner jessica  yeah we have no idea who that is  so youre kind of just proving our point  i see  very well  looking for this  well played  oh  sighs  crying  dude whats up  im just having a bad day sir  all right brobro lets just be cool  and sit down and pee in silence like dudes do  its just i started a new job  and its stressful enough  just having my own wastebasket that i have to fill every day  without liz lemon yelling at me  and i just wish i had never been born  heaves  cause if i cant even get my friend liz  at least i thought she was my friend  to respect me how will i ever run a network  and boss around those jewish executives  that were trained from birth to argue  so i should just give liz what she wants  and quit  sobbing bro  you should just smack that liz in the mouth  sorry i babbled so much  thanks for listening  im kenneth by the way  me too im kenneth  kenneth uh  toilethole  im so sorry dr melvoin  you know i already apologized to vickie and to fat vickie  fat vickies parents were very upset  that she was dragged into this mess  i know i know what i did was stupid  and ive really learned my lesson  look if i could go back in time  id just id skip clarinet  and id go to the spring football with my friends  and none of this ever wouldve happened  or you simply could have not posted those pictures  on hot vickies youface page miss hooper  uh hold on melvoin  you told me it was the piano  and that everyone went to the king of prussia mall  well  i dont remember  and im just so emotional right now  sniffs  ha  im sorry how are you related to miss hooper  im her nemesis  you bastard  dont do this donaghy  i think that this school  has done everything it can for kaylie  but the only fitting punishment  is expulsion  its days like this that remind me  why i got into teaching in the first place  kenneth we need to talk  i dont know cause someone  who actually cares about my feelings  told me to smack you in the mouth  no dont listen to kenneth toilethole   you know him  yeah hes great  we should all go get dinner sometime  kenneth you can do this job  and i do respect you  then wash my feet with your hair  no but i did completely rewrite the show  were not even using the word dingbat mr parcell  a parcell man has never been called mister  outside of an execution chamber  oh boy  crying  the blonde ones they turned on me  they threw me away like i was some kind of judy  oh god is this how judy felt  judy was nice and sweet  and wanted to get a coffee enema or something  and i treated her like garbage  well then why dont you apologize to her  shes right behind you  oh  judy youre so beautiful now  oh  i just came to say goodbye before i head home  i wish we had spent more time together  but i guess ill see you on tv  no

leaving you just  no problem ill cover  day two of my fast and you were right  my mind is clear and im sharp as a tack  great tray thanks  my brain is working overtime  i finally understand the ending of the sixth sense  those names are the people who worked on the movie  oh yeah and i just got  what you were trying to tell me yesterday  you want me to do my filthy standup act  instead of reading the cue cards  no  jack help  i was right about kaylie and i crushed her  thats great i need  the whole time she was playing me  but in the end she made the biggest mistake  she could not have been worse in that meeting  than if she had wanted me to  son of a dingbat  tracys gonna do his standup act on the show  what are we gonna do  im gonna live bleep him  normally id have to get permission
