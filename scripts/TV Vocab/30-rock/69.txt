 and work where  im always being interrupted  oh i get it  a little pete time  pardon the familiarity  well you just enjoy your coffee sir  while i tell you a funny story  about my friends cat  his name is mr wiggles  and his cats name is benson  wheres liz  i need to speak to her right away  i guess thats the end of pete and kenneth time  liz shes here  vernas here  my mother is downstairs  are you sure  i didnt see her security called  she was trying to use  an oxycontin prescription bottle as id  thats verna  oh  so is she coming up  are you kidding  i told them to throw her off the property  but im sure shes down there  sitting on a curb chainsmoking  and waiting for me to come out  just like the day i was born  wow  look jenna i know that shes no prize  but no matter what verna is your mother  dont you want to have a relationship with your mother  this isnt a relationship  this is some woman who shows up  every couple of years to ask for money  to her im just a gorgeous  naturallyblonde atm  you know my mother and i sometimes didnt see eye to eye  but at the end of the day we always said  dont go to sleep  with a frown in your pocket  ugh liz you dont know anything about mothers  wheres jack  go into your yard and tie it on a rocket  both shoot it to the moon  youll be feeling better soon  dont go to bed with a frown  yeah there were firemen there and everything  where  at my house  i left my sith lord cloak  too near my moms shrine to italian jesus  and the candles started a fire  were the firemen strong  were any of them the ones from the calendar  my moms staying with family upstate  but ive got to find someplace around here to crash  im sorry  would you like to stay in my guest house  yeah thanks  whens good to go over there  oh im not offering  im just taking a survey  to gauge general interest  but liz here has a spare apartment  aint that right liz  well its not really spare  i bought the place upstairs from me  when i thought i was getting a talk show  but im gonna finish the combination  as soon as i either hit the lottery  or get married  ugh fine you can stay with me  but its stuff like this  that makes me eat things like this  thanks liz  oh id like to preapologize  for clogging your tub sink and toilet  mothers  you cant kill them  vernas been using me my whole life jack  i never saw a penny from any of the commercials i booked  keep you and your pets safe  with gator hater gator spray  sorry honey you got to get closer to the gator  we drove eleven hours to get here  and youre not getting any younger  but when i wanted to sing a duet  in a motherdaughter pageant  she blew it off because there was no prize money  but todays different jenna  today you break the cycle  because today you are going to say  i developed this presentation in 2002  when colleen attempted  to lengthen her christmas visit  to martin luther king day  or as she calls it  that day in january  when the post office is closed  i had to draw the line  i had to say  this word is your best friend  best friend with benefits  step one say no  step two  she will try to pick a fight with you  you will not let her  she will raise her voice  but im going to ask you to  always speak quieter  can i just tell you im genuinely having fun right now  if you raise your voice  emotions take over  and she gets the upper hand  but if youre calm and quiet  you stay in control  and its on to step three  and this is the hardest one of all  she will tell you how disappointed she is in you  and she will get up to leave  and you  let her walk away  its simple  say no talk low  let her go  frank frank  do you smell smoke  what the hell frank  oh man look liz  how can you smoke its disgusting  and in my apartment  wow an old white lady yelling at me  while wearing microwavable socks  this is so different than living with my mom  okay so i smoke a little as a stress release  i never told you cause i knew youd lecture me  it is not a lecture  to simply point out to someone  that the episode of diffrent strokes  about dudleys dad  has proven incontrovertibly  that smoking destroys your health  and leads to ridicule from willis  well what about you  you cant judge me  when youre eating that garbage  this is not the same thing at all frank  dr oz did a show about junk food  i saw it cause its on a compilation dvd i have  of fat ladies crying  and this stuff will kill ya  manufactured in a facility that also processes food  this is what meat cat spoke of  so i guess ill just get  one of those little throat radios  and youll be buried in a piano crate  goodnight liz  no frank that fire in your apartment  was no accident  i know i just wanted to be in control  it was fate  weve been brought together  to help each other stop being gross  what do you say  all right  but if doing this restores my sex drive  the plussized ladies in the mail room  have you to blame  oh theres my baby girl  hello verna  no low go  okay i know  every time we see each other  im always hitting you up for money  and i know that its always for something stupid  like paying the medical bills  that time that my boyfriend  broke his tailbone off in that cage match  but this time its different  i said no  wait what is this  im trying to pay you back  im trying to make good for once  is this the fight  im talking quieter  im in control  whats that now  im the calm one  upper hand  jenna why are we talking like this  does somebody have a gun  im going lower now  okay  well i know youre busy  i just wanted to say this face to face  i am so proud of you  and i love you so much  and i wish id said that more  dont go mommy  ill stand closer to the gator  goon  sorry im late mr hornberger  funny story  there was a guy on the subway  who i thought for a second didnt have any fingers  but then i realized  he was holding his hand like this  listen up everyone  frank and i have some exciting news to share  i am quitting smoking  and i am gonna start eating healthier  i signed up for a service called noofud  that delivers humanelyportioned organic meals  and i took the elevator all the way up here  without losing my breath  liz god knows you should eat better  but maybe nows not the time  its show week  and i cant have you melting down  and junk food is your stress release  we all need a release  i know because kenneth has taken mine away from me  and im worried about what im gonna do to replace it  while you were talking  i put a thumbtack in my neck  makes me feel something  well dont worry about me pete  i have a new outlet  my delicious noofud  like my upcoming lunch  autumn tempeh risotto  with salmonrubbed streusel chunks  oh  jenna  i just wanted to see  how it went with verna last night  jack it was perfect  like a john mayer song  good so you said no  i didnt have to she didnt want anything  shes completely changed  what no  people do not change  in the late 90s  i thought colleen had become a better person  it
