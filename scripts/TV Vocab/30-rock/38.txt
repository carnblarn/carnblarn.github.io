nothing  meanwhile grizz and dotcom bought a boat  cape hatteras is lovely this time of year  oh well of course tracy takes care of his boys and not you  he thinks he can take advantage of you because

lie  a white lie that did a lot of good for this countrys morale  did you know that president bushs approval rating was almost as high as 15 following the olympics  gasp olympic hero tyler brody

okay im jeffrey i am a mediator  and you two are having a dispute  now why is that  because tracy thinks he can treat me unfairly because im a woman  what please  we are here because white folks think they can do whatever they want to do to black folks  its like when adrien brody kissed halle berry at the oscars  white people stole jazz rock and roll will smith and heart disease  now they think they can take my hardearned money  ay well if we look at how voice actors are normally compensated  liz says in this days america its harder to be a woman than a black man  liz lemon that chick is
