four people for a reason  the first guy jacks settling in  the second he hates the third is jayden  the fourth proves how good jayden is  the more people you add the less effective it is  like a

paranoia where   ugh  you are not taking away the one good thing  that i get out of this miserable process   if youre talking abou hiring jayden youre insane  just call anyone hes ever worked with   i did  i called every one of his references  and they are impressive  a commercial with martin scorsese  an offbroadway play with christopher walken  hes even studying the meisner technique  with sir gilbert gottfried  and they all said the same thing  scorsese all right let me tell you one thing about jayden  i love jayden  walken i love jayden  gottfried i love jayden   was describing your sandwich necessary  to our understanding of what happened   none of your actors are auditioning  the hornberger system will prevail   think again liz  the hornberger system will devail  is that the opposite of prevail   sighs   i hoped it wouldn come to this  but now i have to ruin jayden psychologically   tell me more   im gonna walk up to him  and say the four most vicious words  you can say to a person youve already met  nice to meet you   and that freaks people out huh  this is a learning and friendship adventure   lemon are you ready to get started   yes i just need one minute  to send some of these people home   really  youre just going to kick all of them to the curb  like so much human garbage  why are you being so cold and dispassionate   what because you told me to   and you just blindly do whatever i say  what are you a robot   you also told me to be a robot  what is going on with you   i have bedbugs  and these bedbugs have chewed the blinders off my eyes  these are all people lemon with feelings   grr   and they all get a chance they all get to audition  anyone who wants to audition just give your name to pete   anthony decicco  ill need an obama wig  frank rossitano queens new york  i guess dreams can come true  so last weekend i was at the mall  but then i wen to the beach bleep  with my nieces friend  and then i bleep a the pool party   mmhmm  mm   for my first character id like to do an old janitor  whos finally had enough and stabs everybody   hello im jenna maroney   oh hi im jayden nice to meet you   how dare you pretend you dont remember me  im the one who doesn remember you   josh gerard former tgs cast member  then some movie work that didnt pan out  then my agent dropped me then a web short  where they made me do guyguy stuff  oh god forgive me  i call this character smelly belly   good evening we are laugh of the mohicans  our first bit is the hamburglar   no   toofer and lutz didnt tell me they were gonna go together  this throws off the whole system  i gotta find one more   hey dotcom nice to meet you   why would he say that to me   have you ever wondered what happens  in the refrigerator after the light goes off  does the milk say  lets go down to the crisper drawer  and make trouble  i dont know fuhgeddaboutit   you wanna be on a tv show  come on  come on come on   growing up in bedstuy there was a certain music  to the way people talked  hey papi  whatchoo doin  im sorry can i start over  someone really messed with my head right before i came on   i dreamed that love   would never die   i dreamed that god   would be forgiving    mechanical sounds   okay here we go you can do it   hi im jayden michael tyler  my first piece will be a dinner party  at martin scorseses house with christopher walken  and gilbert gottfried  what   as christopher walken thank you for inviting us  martin   as gilbert gottfried i brought wine   wheezing laughter  son of a bitch  i was talking to you on the phone wasnt i   what   poorly impersonating walken giveit up  i figured out your game   congratulations  your show is so stupid i thought you would be too   i cant believe i went through all of this for you  i fought for you jayden  and now im gonna have to start all over   no you dont  youre giving me the job no matter what  because your fingerprints are all over my camera   so   so  you said youd only hire me  if i let you take pictures of my genitals   oh no  what is wrong with them  jenna was right youre totally crazy   would a crazy person laugh like this  maniacal laughter   mechanical sounds   you can use the regular elevators around the corner  youre the one whos human here   despondent intonation   well said   jenna youre right hes crazy  we cant hire him   who brian williams  no jayden  im sorry i doubted you  its just that youve never been right before  about anything   i know   i gotta find jack  tell him we didnt find anyone and we have to start over   my two cents i liked the janitor   id never been to an audition before  it was upsetting  a grotesque carnival of human misery   to be fair i did not think kathy geiss  was gonna finish her song by taking off her underpants   however the process was a pleasant reminder  that some of us are in fact better than others  there was one clear standou in my opinion   no i know  he was my favorite too but we cant  hes crazy we have to start over   all actors are crazy lemon  and the more talented they are the crazier they are  i mean look at jenna and tracy  they handed in a check request form  for 600000 worth of gas  your job is to manage the crazy and bring out the talent   crazy is one thing hes a psychopath   youre wrong hes a good person  and this conversation is over  were hiring the robot   the robot is the guy that you like  and you think hes the best because   because he was the only one of them  the only person in new york that would shake the hand  of a man with bedbugs  lemon were not just hiring an actor  were hiring a coworker a human being  and i say we hire the one  who lives by the code of the robot  care love live   okay  so instead of starting from scratch  we are hiring the robot  on the show to act  boy i hope  yikes   this little light of mine lord   all im gonna let it shine   whoa this little ligh of mine lord   im gonna let it shine   this little ligh of mine lord   im gonna let it shine   every day every day   let it shine   every day every day   im gonna let it shine   oh every day every day   im gonna let it shine   every day every day   im gonna let it shine   every day every day
