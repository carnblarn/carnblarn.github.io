advertisers theyre gonna pull the plug on tgs  think about how youre hurting the crew  i dont want to hurt the crew i love the crew  all we do is joke around together  about our stupid boss liz lem  anyway unless you know  an advertiser that really wants to be associated with this  you need to stop  great idea  which part are you talking about  the first 23  i dont need to stop being myself  if i am the advertiser  i have the money  ill just buy up all the ads  and let that hilarious tracy jordan character   do whatever he wants  put the phone down you cant do that   jack wont let you  well see about that  i need you to set up a meeting with you and the folks from ad sales  what do you mean youre not in charge anymore  tracy jordan from tracyco called to invite you to a luncheon   celebrating their new ad campaign  what seriously not now  all right everyone back to the drawing board  legal rejected all of our ideas  every names we came up with was offensive in some language  including english  they knew what a hot richard was  so were going to think outside the box a little bit here  im going to pick some random letters from this bag of scrabble tiles  let fate choose a name for us  why dont we start over  i have an idea why dont i just pull them all at once  why dont we take a break  could you get lemon on the phone for me please  ms gaulke  how long have you been

employees do you have ms gaulke  i supervise 12 employees  most of whom would be unemployable in any other field  they are selfish irresponsible people  who i know talk about me behind my back  they seem to think that their job is wasting my time and energy  by making their every minuscule problem  my personal responsibility  they dont care  and dont even get me started on tracy and jenna  and when the last one of them trundled off that night  i smelled the air and i could feel that it was time  time for a new beginning  and i knew that this was possible only through a cleansing fire  it would all have to burn  the packing peanuts the delivery slips  all of it would dance in the warm mouth of my fire  and a new better wonderful me  would rise from the ashes like a phoenix  behold  the splendor of my beginning  i rest my case your honor  desperate times call for desperate measures  underlings i wanna hear your ideas  i knew this day would come i have so much inside of me  my first
