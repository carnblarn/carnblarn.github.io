only reason was to trick her into giving up her honor to him  uhhuhand how did he use her mail to do thatexactly  he read her most intimate secrets and turned himself into that which she desired  what she loved he pretended to love too until it was too late  my dog ran away  ohmy god let me get my coat   buster  buster   come hereboybuster  if see the doggive us a shoutthank you  the funny thing is

friend  this role has made me rich famous and respected  i get to cut the line at disneyland if i come midweek  i have a lucrative endorsement deal with sabor de soledad  ahora con mas semen del toro  i am not going to let you ke all that away from me  i know where you came fromhector  play ballor youll be back doing rrated hypnotism at the bull fights so fast  you wont know what hit you  you come over here and say that to my face   noyou come over here  nunca  if you refuse to be reasonable i must call the presidente of telemundo  la oficina de jack donaghy  hola  wellplayedjack  i see that we are not so differentyou and i   we laugh alike  we think ali  at timeswe even drink alike  you can lose your mind  lookyou should know im doing this for a woman  this woman  wowi am super gay and i would totally switch for her  shes amazing  but her grandmother hates me because she hates the generalissimo so hes gotta go  el generalissimo does not have to die to clear the way to theabuela  not if theabuela comes to love him  but thats impossible  seduction ner impossible forel generalissimo  i will become everything that old hispanic women desire  i will make her love me  you really think you can pull that off  it will be the performance of a lifetime  like julie harris inthe belle of amherst  wowyou are surprisingly gay  okayso  so did you ever find buster  what did youerstan that picture is from a dog food ad  hilemon heres todays script  i translated itand took out thestar warsreferences  are you an actress  noim a nurse  ohgood  dont listen to anyone who says you should become an actress  okay  uhi also cut the scene between the general and tia maria  they cannot be together  not after what he did to marias daughter  why what did he do  ohit was despicable  even worse than his misuse of the mails  the generalissimo tricked her to the villa by inviting her to a fancy party  but when she got there it was just the two of them  he drugged her champagne and had his way with her  latershe gave birth to the devil you knowsweeps week  thats what i could do to drew  drug him lizno  having been on both sides of that i could tell you its not a good idea  noim going to tell drew that im having a little  wcome to the building party for him but there is no party  and thenwhen he shows up ill laugh and say ohits the wrong night  and then hell laugh and say ohwell one glass couldnt hurt  and then i will put my mouth on his mouth  nolemon do not do this  the trickery the deceit is a slippery slope  yeahbut you havent seen dr baird he lks like a cartoon pilot  be very careful  el generalissimo was once a good man  but the years of loneliness drove him insane  i am not the generalissimo elisa  mr jordan i called my clharland and i got his hangover cure  mix two cups boiled possum meat with one messload ragweed stir in alcohol   ken these interns are wearing me out  its like i said in my nothit comedy cruise boat im gettin too old for this ship  wellyou are getting oldersir  theres no reason you have to keep acting like youre 20  yesthere is  do you know what happens to a comedian when he gets old and loses his audience  he starts to get offered serious roles  and do you really want to see me play arthur ashe  that would be terrible  you leave him alone  exactly  so if im gonna keep my hilarious reputation these interns gotta go  but wherethey dont know how to do anything  and there are no jobs left on wall street  then ill find something for them to do  drew  ohuh am i the first one here  what  nothe partys tomorrow night  tonight im just hanging out eating fondue by candlelight  bucome in i was just opening a bottle of wine to drink alone  okayi guess one glass couldnt hurt   i found your dog  what  he lost his collar but i recognize him from the poster  thats not possible  of course its possible  how could he not want to come back to this beautiful lady  my dog is back  ill open the wine  just put him down
