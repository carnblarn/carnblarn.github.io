kind of a problem for me  cause i already spent that down payment  on the first half of my boob job  its not an implant  its just a little yank up you know  i mean i got the meat jack  go ahead feel em feel the difference  very different indeed  like a cantaloupe  and a ziploc bag of mushroom soup  but youre not getting the rest of that money  until you give jenna all the mothers day love she

youre damn right it isnt  in florida everybodys always asking me  where did you get that you made it  holy crap where do i commission one  oh this is about you making money selling junk  groans  verna this is my job  and i know you dont understand that  cause you havent had a job in 15 years  because of my back  because of the trampoline accident  but i need to look a certain way on tv  you are nothing but a spoiled brat  you know what  heres what i think of you  and your fancy clothes  that is quality stitching  damn the tiny brown hands that made this  oh there you are  just thought id tidy up  thats my computer  oh no honey  a computer is a great big thing with a green screen  mom do you think its weird  that im still single  well your standards are very high  as they should be  i remember someone who got a three  on her history ap test  but do i expect too much  maybe the moms were right  maybe i should have just settled  i cant tell you what to do liz  but i know from experience that that gu  that perfect guy is out there  cause i know i found mine  see thats all i want  what you and dad have  oh im not talking about your father  what  what do you mean youre not talking about dad  you love dad of course i do  but dick lemon isnt ed  ed whos ed  ed was my true love sweetheart  he was my steady at montclair high  the night before he was shipped off to korea  i repeatedly lost my virginity to him  while waldo the town perv  watched from the bushes  wait what  nothing younger me its fine  he wanted to get married  but when he was invited to houston  for his astronaut training  he was an astronaut  you could have been an astronauts wife  it wasnt that simple liz  i had just graduated from secretary school  and i got a job at sterling cooper  i couldnt just pick up and move  i was already 26 an old maid  different times octomom  so i settled for a wonderful man  and i have never regretted it  not even when i watched ed aldrin walk on the moon  wait your ed is buzz aldrin  yeah but i always called him ed  because our town had like five buzzes  you could have married buzz aldrin  you should regret that mom  you should have followed him  laura linney could have played you  in the hbo original movie moon wives  where are you going verna  oh i quit  ive been working my ass off  pretending to be a good mom  but jenna doesnt appreciate it  i see  well then good luck paying for that other implant  its not an implant jack  i mean i got the meat  of course i apologize  verna you have a very simple decision to make  quit dont get paid  and drive around with one headlight out  or swallow your pride  and get the money you need tomorrow  they said they were gonna put a wig on me or something  so that nobody would recognize me  as the pajamarall lady  like anyone would recognize you anyway  im sorry what did you say  you are way beneath me novella  i am a movie star a television actor  and a guinness book of world record holder  for most car accidents in a single year  maybe you wanted someone more highprofile  but i am what you got  so tracy you better watch yourself  or you may wind up with no mother at all  fine id rather be up on that stage all alone  than to be with someone  whose resume has black judge on it nine times  and you think i wanted a fake son  who recorded an anticondom psa  i saved a lot of kids from lame sex  little ingrate  all right start with taxes  then insurance and change this to latin america  i cant say nicaragua  gah  you must be avery  yes  i am so sorry miss jessup  mrs donaghy keeps tricking me and running away  but not anymore  carl they need you out in the hall  yes maam  mrs donaghy  you must be jacks mother  indeed i am  and jack has told me so much about you  youre going to have to work your backside  because chestwise  you have the measurements of an altar boy  i wish jack had told me you were in town  well men have their little secrets dont they  especially jack  secrets  what im trying to say is  if youre serious about jackie  let him know now  a man like jack has other irons in the fire  i beg your pardon  oh look at the time  ive got to get back to calling kenneth carl  to see if he ever corrects me  carl  yes maam  laughs  lemon have you seen colleen  kenneth was supposed to be watching her  but i just saw him with his eyes closed  counting to infinity  you want to talk about moms jack  listen to this  my mother could have married buzz aldrin  oh really i know buzz  we met at a photo shoot  for vanity fairs annual awesome gentleman issue  my mom blew it jack  she had true love and she threw it away  just because it was inconvenient  well lemon if your mom had ended up with buzz  you would have never been born  or i would have been born peter aldrin  and id wait for a woman with the right stuff  now remember in this scenario  im a man and my father is an astronaut  well lemon if youd like to see  what your moms life would have been  i can arrange for you to meet buzz  are you serious hes in town  i saw him last night at rupert murdochs twister party  i mean uh regular party  tracy this mothers day thing is a disaster  i hear you  because youre talking in the ear  that i didnt lose a button in  i thought verna and i had made this breakthrough  but now were just back  to fighting about money and clothes  thank god terrys dead  or wed be fighting over him again too  boy i thought i had it bad with my fake mom  are you kidding  at least your fake mom  has to act like she cares about you  yeah its true  and she is a good actress  i bought those pajamaralls  and you got to choose her  no jenna no one gets to choose their mom  even when theyre fake  for good or bad  were stuck with them  and you know what  they dont get to choose who we are either  and god knows were not perfect  its true  sometimes i sing too beautifully  what a nice surpri  is there another woman  what how did you colleen  dont blame your mother jack  this is about us  oh my god look avery you know how i feel  so im gonna skip the part where i deny anything  then you skip the part where you yell at me  and then we both move on to the uh makeup sex  wow  that is a swing  look i assumed you and i were exclusive  but we never talked about it  so maybe this is partly my fault  and i forgive you come here  im sorry  but these tactics have worked on stupider women  if were going to move forward  you better figure out what it is you want  soon  excuse me dr aldrin  im sorry there wasnt a door so i just  i dont believe in barriers  because i always break them  you must be liz  yes sir  i actually came about my mother margaret lemon  well you would have known her as margaret freeman  maggie freeman of course i remember her  well im sorry to bother you  but i cant help but wonder what my mom lost  by giving up on you  her perfect man  perfect sure im a famous astronaut  decorated fighter pilot doctorate from mit  but even i sometimes  i see you i see what youre doing  return to the night youve no business here  are you yelling at the moon  im sorry she and i just  i get mad sometimes  sure  look you want to know what your mother missed  years of drinking depression cheating  i flipped over a saab in the san fernando valley  i once woke up in the air and space museum  with a revolver in the waistband of my jean shorts  oh my god but youre  a human being  but im at peace now  sober almost 32 years  but i would have put maggie freeman through hell  sighs  the moms were right  theres no such thing as astronaut mike dexter  what am i doing  im sorry if ive disappointed you  would you like to yell at the moon with buzz aldrin  yes please  i own you  you dumb moon  i walked on your face  dont you know its day
