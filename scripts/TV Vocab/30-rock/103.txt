frasier spinoff hey roz  jenna they hate you  no jack they love to hate me  kidz is minting money for both of us  and whats more important than money  well perhaps we could make even more money  by pretending to be nice  i mean look at betty white  end of discussion just ease off on the kids  look according to tracy  people are switching minds around here  thats obviously whats happened  so

hiding something from us  like what a present for me  can i return it for cash  no this is bigger than that  something like a sexchange operation  or a secret pregnancy or a radioactive spider bite  ive got to get her focus back on me  or who knows the dumb stuff im going to start doing  is that why youre not wearing pants right now  yes im actually glad this happened  youre proving my point  look if you think somethings going on with liz  just follow her  steal her mail go through her trash  thats what paul and i do to maintain intimacy  when hes having his period  thanks jmo great advice

 both laughing  time to die  you know what emma that was pretty good  you were trying to get me to commit suicide right  crowd boos  liddy thank you for coming in  i know you have to read your books with sleepy bear  in half an hour so ill make this brief  youre almost one now and you have to understand  the way the world works  now i dont know if youve seen americas kidz got singing  but its a hit  variety called it boffo  and they dont throw that word around lightly  however there are large portions of the show  that feature jenna insulting children  not much older than yourself  i know what youre thinking  do you really care about the bottom line  more than the feelings of helpless innocents  thats cruel well guess what liddy  life is cruel  sometimes in business theres collateral damage  and if you think im going to turn my back  on a 10242 in the demo just because i feel bad  just because those kids had the same scared look on their faces  that you had when that dog  got too close to your stroller in the park  and yes being a parent  is like wearing your heart outside your body  and i dont want you to know that the world  is really a scary disappointing place  you shouldnt have to know that not yet  crying oh god  i have to cancel the show  what are you doing liddy  are you touching my hand becauseyoure a baby  and youre developing your fine motor skills  or are you trying to tell me something  what are you trying to tell me  mommy  did you say money  is that your first word money  mommy   yes money  are you telling me that moneys more important  than doing whats right  that i should keep on doing the show  i want mommy  i want money too  oh thank you liddy  thank you for convincing me to do the right thing  aw  hey think how disappointed i am  i
