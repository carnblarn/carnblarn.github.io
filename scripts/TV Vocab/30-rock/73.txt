with him  yeah like what if we trick him into kissing me  itd be so funny because im not gay  or if the pranksmen write that times profile ourselves  making danny look like an idiot  and put it in the press packet  that everybody gets  this is the most friends ive ever had  kenneth im having a tracy and jenna problem  gosh mr hornberger  you say that so often  you should come up with a shortcut word for it  like ivatrennapra  well dannys interview with the new york times  comes out today so ivatrennapra  a what  if tracy and jenna hear about it  theyll get jealous and act out  and as much as i want to  i cant slap the brat out of them  so tracy and jenna will spend the day in the makeup room  having full plaster impressions made of their faces  so that should shut them up for uh lets say 12 hours  oh my thats a long time  maybe i should keep them company  yes tell them your stories  theyll hate that  silly mr hornberger  always saying hate when he means love  hello floyd its liz  thank you for calling me back  we have so much to catch up on  yeah so how are you oh my god  youre not gonna ask me whats wrong with my voice  i was being polite  chuckles look liz im sorry i havent

an interview for the new york times  and they printed all of this stuff that i didnt say  typical liberal media  thats why i get all my news  from dick cheneys website dickviewscom  i never said that liz banged her way to the middle  or that jenna kidnapped a swedish au pair  to use as a hair farm  and i never called tracy clean and articulate  why would i hes not  this stuff is in the newspaper jack  everyones gonna see it no theyre not  its a hoax what  the new york times doesnt have a staff writer  named seymour nips  youve been pranked by the nerds  my guess is this is the work of frank the black one  and  lutz  the writers why would they do that to me  because they look at you and youre everything theyre not  youre handsome so are you jack  i wasnt fishing but thank you  danny we will not let this stand  well then what are we gonna do  im no stranger to the art of japery  at princeton i was in a secret society  i shouldnt tell you this  but one time we snuck up to dartmouth  put their mascot in a box  and sent it to mexico city  we didnt know until the next day  that it was an actual indian  he didnt speak a word of english  like all dartmouth men  all right im game  lets team up what should we call ourselves  whats the most handsome animal  both the silver panther  snarling  tv chatter  guess who called me  the boob job recall center  no floyd  were having dinner tomorrow night  and i dont know what it means  but i am allowing myself to be excited  i mean on the phone it was like  we were just right back there liz and floyd  liz and who come on floyd  my exboyfriend the only good boyfriend ive ever had  recovering alcoholic he used to work in this building  oh you mean that guy  and of course this is our other finalist couple  for the today wedding contest floyd and kaitlin  cheers and applause  whahk  an old gus is the biggest catfish in the pond  legend has it the only bait  thatll catch old gus  is a piece of old gus himself  so everytime they catch him  they cut off a litlle piece of him  so they can catch him  now how did the very first person catch old gus  well thats a story for another time  right now  so if my grandfather hadnt gotten  on the wrong train that day  he never would have met his wifes murderer  i wonder what hawaiis state quarters gonna be  nobody knows  but here are several hundred guesses  a pineapple a coconut  soft music    uh lemon could i have your weakness files  on frank toofer and lutz  floyds getting married maybe on the today show    floyd never told you  i mean bs before hs but that is low  this sucks jack  i know that im a sour person  and i dont like a lot of people  but i liked floyd  and i guess in the back of my mind  i thought wed end up together someday  that you know the whole thing would turn out like a movie  where christopher cross sings a song like  all my days ive been waiting   for you to come back home   in the moonlight   of new york city   lemon im sorry  we all have our romantic pipe dreams  i thought that nancy would leave her husband for me  and its not going to happen  theyre boston irish catholic they mate for life  like swans like drunk  angry swans  distant cheering vote for floyd and kaitlin  i love this woman  oh my god  i can hear him on the plaza  cheers and applause  hey keep it down out there  this isnt liz  okay its bad enough that he is getting married  but does he have to do it right outside my window  no he cannot win this contest  lemon i know youre hurt and i know that look  but dont even think about revenge  you are not a silver panther  what are you talking about  just stick to the high road  the low road is a slippery slope  sighs i know jack believe me  i mean its like on tv it used to be  you couldnt say crap and then they let that slide  and now we can say whatever we want  douche bag asswipe  anal rot exactly  so im simply gonna ask floyd  as a friend and former intercourse companion  to do me the favor  of not getting married right outside my window  im gonna meet him tomorrow night at mcshanleys for dinner  mcshanleys the place where you got food poisoning  from the fish three times  so so are you sure  youre not planning to get floyd sick  and sabotage his chance of winning  what no jack that never even occurred to me  then youll never be a silver panther  i dont care ill start my own group  rejection from society is what created the xmen  so to get there you start on old barn road  then you take the first left then the next left  then the next left and then another left  thatll take you
