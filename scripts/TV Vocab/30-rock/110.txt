 you cant count on anyone else in this city jack  all you can do is sink down into the filth  clears throat  or rise above it  if no one will help me ill do it myself  ill remind new york of what she once was  yes a native american paradise  the greatest city on earth  a city that needs a leader  who still believes in order and justice  wholl shine a light into all the tunnels  and police the police  wholl make this city into a beacon  lighting the way for an entire nation  anyhoo tracy in the dog boner sketch  i hereby officially announce my candidacy  for the office of mayor of the city

we hate it  i dont know  i always imagined this kind of thing  would make me wanna tear my hair out and rip my skin off  but with you it feels as natural as  having someone tear your hair out and rip your skin off  i never thought this would happen to me but i can actually  imagine myself getting married having kids  but is this really what we want  i dont know   what are you thinking  what are you thinking  okay well both say what were thinking  on the count of three  one two  both sexual walkabout  we spend the next three months alone  doing every depraved thing we can think of  with as
