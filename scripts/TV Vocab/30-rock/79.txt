look its a pretty standard workmans comp claim  im sure you could handle it  i was flying at 700 am from tampa to louisville  and we had a twohour weather delay  so naturally all the passengers got drunk  generally speaking if theres a delay  of more than 20 minutes i might as well be driving a party bus  its just idiocy  i dont know whats going on in this country   i know people wear flipflops to church  and the nba tattoo situation is out of control  thank you anyway were about a half hour into the flight  i hear this commotion behind me in the cabin  so i exit the cockpit i go down the aisle  and to my left i see  a terrorist  no i wish its a drunk lady  shes pulled her pants off and shes ranting  shes complaining about the inflight entertainment  so things got a little heated  and i had to implement sky law   whats  sky law  its when i put on the fasten seatbelt sign  and no ones allowed to move  till weve had ten minutes of silence  i made the whole thing up  but you know people are stupid  so they dont question it  that is awesome  so what is the workmans comp part of this  eventually i flipped the drunk lady off  she bit my finger  i know it was totally unprofessional  but she was bagging pretty hard on my tgs   what  tgs  its this latenight show on nbc  we run it inflight when were northwestbound  basically the greatest thing ever on television  i dont stand for anybody besmirching it on my aircraft  do you believe in fate  wait a minute are you kidding me  you write for tgs with tracy jordan  im the head writer  im not an insurance claims adjustor  im just here because my cousin  well i mean its my favorite show ever  theres the one fart doctor sketch  where this fart doctors trying to figure out who farted  in the spelling bee and hes like  he who spelt it dealt it  i wrote that i write all of the fart doctors  i cant believe this  would you like to go to a rich girls wedding with me  i dont know does that sound like more fun  than me eating alone at the laguardia chilis  i wont leave you sir  no matter what it takes  good afternoon and welcomenot  we begin our stupid tour  of this oncegreat network  outside studio 6h  uhoh

decision  was better than no decision at all  huh i dont know jack  i used to feel that way too but now i know  you cant force your fate  you just have to let it wash over you  like a spray tan that wont take because your skin is too oily  thats absurd lemon  the world is made by those who control  their own destiny  it isnt made by those who dont do  its made by those who do do  which is what made me the man i am  i do do  yeah  grow up lemon  the point is i made my choice and im not looking back  period period  avery jessup  son of a  what did you do on your tour today  those were the kabletown executives  our new bosses  sir i was just trying to do a bad job  so i wouldnt have to go to los angeles  everyone there smiles creepily all the time  and thats sort of my thing  kenneth

told me all the reasons that you loved me  some more graphic  than were appropriate for the setting  now i want you to tell me  whats so special about this other woman  well i like how shes less hot than you  im serious  what can i say  shes smart shes pretty  she can tell you the dow 40 in order of market cap  she knows how to field dress a deer  why do you  go on  okay  her laugh is like music  really mean music  and she always wears high heels  because according to her flat shoes are for quitters  for gods sake what can i say  youd like her so you werent lying  when you said you were in love with two women   no i wasnt lying  good  then i feel a lot better about leaving   what  averys here jack  and shes pregnant  oh my god  this is crazy  ah its fate  you were supposed to be a dad  and by the way when i blew your mind last night  i was giving it about 50  unhand my fiancee  no no hes just a groomsman  and a somali pirate careful  you tried to end our engagement  with a textual transmission  your behavior as a fiancee  has been as weak as american tea  there ive said it  our first argument everyone  youre engaged  what if the bachelorette party theme was sluts  no the engagement is off  you keep talking about how fate is trying to push us together  you know what it is but not to meet you  to meet the right man  his name is carol  like carroll oconnor from nick at nite  exactly cerie thank you  carol is the one that i was fated to meet  and yeah ive only known him for a few hours  and maybe this sounds crazy  but i already feel like i could spend  the rest of my life with him  hes the one that ive been waiting for  and someday when carol sees my disgusting foot secret  hes gonna be okay with it  i can tell  you were wrong wesley  we dont have to settle  the moms were wrong  stupid buzz aldrin was wrong  so thank you and goodbye  praise to the universe love is real  fine  its your loss  theres only one wesley snipes in this world  you know there isnt  how much of that did you hear  well you were engaged  apparently you hate buzz aldrin  foot problem  and you and i are going to spend  the rest of our lives together  i see  im sure you could get a cab on houston  yeah im gonna depart  on time  im a pilot  jack  carol  in your eyes   in your eyes   there is a light   in your eyes   in your eyes   could you turn that down please  there is a light   mazel tov  im trying to tell you i want to get married  oh for gods sakes jack  what do you think youre just gonna sweep me off my feet  this pregnancy is two years ahead of schedule  im suing dodecacil  im suing you im suing this baby  you cant control everything avery  sometimes its just fate  ugh is their gay juice in the champagne  see i want you to teach our child  how to say awesome stuff like that   i would be a kickass mom  but if this is just you trying to do the right thing   no i want this  ive always wanted this  but maybe its too hard  the career motherhood  keeping it tight  to stay cameraready for breaking news  i mean sure soledad obrien does it but   i wipe the floor with that bitch  lets do this  love is patient  love is weird and sometimes gross  love is elusive and you have found it  so treasure it  to grizz and feyonce  on behalf of grizz and feyonce  id like to thank jack donaghy  for letting us have this reception here  after the other location couldnt support the weight  of grizzs extended family  naturally i blew it  now im alone in a dashiki  i wonder what that somali pirates deal is  i could live on a boat  i dont even know where paul went  i guess he made his choice  you know what forget men  weve got each other  yeah lets go lez  no i meant like a book club or something jeez  right sisterhood  thats something we can count on  ill never is that paul   you have a lot of tapedup balls  to come here dressed like that  oh my god  if this is gonna work jenna  it cant just be all about you   but  no buts  im the man here and youre gonna respect me  yes shmaam  lemon you know thats a young boys puberty dashiki  wrong jack its a warlords concubine dashiki  avery youre here  im not surprised why should i be  and im pregnant  also not shocking me reacting appropriately  lemon i think your pilot friend is looking for you  so  i thought he was gone forever  i guess i should go talk to him  carol what are you doing here  how did you get past security  you walk briskly in a pilots uniform  you can go pretty much anywhere  ive been upstairs in the white house  while the obamas were sleeping  i thought you had a flight  yeah i do those dirt bags can wait  on the runway a couple more hours  i hate people too  look im 39 years old im single  and lately ive been thinking theres a reason for that  i keep expecting people to be perfect  but nobodys perfect yes exactly  so if the worst thing about you  is that you give crazy speeches to fiances  and maybe you have some kind of foot thing  that was a joke i have medicine for it  why dont we give this a shot  as long as youre not jewish im totally kidding  yes lets do this  and honestly carol i am a very normal person  not a good time guys  liz cher and me  paul and i want to thank you for being a part  of our lives  and for encouraging us to be like this  i cant believe im meeting   hi hi there hi   carol  carol thats a girls name  its a family name  hey everybody  i got fired today  you wont have kenneth ellen parcell to kick around anymore  so i want to tell you people  what i really think of you   hey this aint the  no no  for four long years i have listened to
