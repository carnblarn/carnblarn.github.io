city on earth new york city baby whassup  wait what are you saying jack  cause tgs is live  not any more  its financially impractical  from now on you write and shoot the whole season in two weeks  like wheel of fortune or fox news  no  i mean i grew up on live tv  in my parent basement on a friday night  a telethon and cheese steaks  i can see it like it was yesterday  best sweet 16 ever  im going to lose my virginity in nine years  tgs has to be live  or it will lose all the excitement and spontaneity  thats the beauty of live tv  anything can happen  theres a bathroom in here  you can

amazing on camera  look  i dont want to propose on tv  i want it to be private  what are you saying paul  rick santorum is right jenna  marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman  which is why im asking you right now  to make me the luckiest schman  look im sorry to play the biological woman card here  but according to roe v dwyane wade  i have a right to choose  and i choose a televised proposal  if you cant give me that  im not sure what my answer will be  are you giving me an ultimatum  look i am the man here jenna  i may have a dress and a wig and a gynecologist  but i am the man  without live tv  think of the amazing moments we would have missed  the moon landing  the beatles  the voice results show  that time mr lutz was an extra  and he got so nervous he threw up  no dont remind him  oh i had a lobster role and two yogurts  and what about joey monteros  old variety show  he was just like you mr jordan  because he did not want to rehearse  and he wanted to

had the first two black characters on television  sort of  for alfie and abner nbc hired  one africanamerican and one caucasian  because they thought two black people on the same show  would make the audience nervous  a rule nbc still uses today  abner im home from work  where are you my brother  here i is alfie  oh hell no i am not doing this  nbc received a lot of complaints  that the show wasnt on often enough  so they forced theodore freeman to honor his contract  alfie is done stole this catfish  sir i am asking you as a human being  so please stop talking like that  is gonna eat it till im bellyful  this is debasing to both of us  i was a tuskegee airman  zipadeegoogoo  you may anger me  but i believe nonviolence is the path to change  and i believes you can catch a rainbow in your hat  ill kill you you ignorant  believe it or not they did not stop doing the show  which made for tense but thrilling live tv  banjo  kenneth  ive frankly lost track  of what you were trying to convince us of  with these detailed descriptions of tv shows  thank you  come on kenneth  times change television replaced radio  cars replaced horses  not where im from  are you telling me the mayor

pregnant  during the 1950s or 60s  if she did you probably cant hear me  because of fetal chatterton syndrome  turn up the volume  recent studies have shown that  while pregnancy is disgusting  babies do not need tar or nicotine  if you are currently suffering from chatterton syndrome  clap your feet until your service monkey dials the number below  then use the rectum you have instead of a mouth  to say something like wrulgh or  thunghth  to signify that you wish to join a class action suit against chattertons  if your mother smokend chattertons  your sexual organs are covered in bone  oh my god kenneth  its my period  its agonna blow  we both know youre not due for another nine days  and im ashamed of you ms lemon  think about your hero rosemary howard  she wrote for the edgiest live
