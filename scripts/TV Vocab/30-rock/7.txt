you were joking  well let me clarify im not joking  pete did you know that men with full heads of hair  on average earn 17 more than their bald counterparts  i did not know that  perhaps its because bald men are generally less informed  than men with full heads of hair  but heres what i want you to do wear the wig for a week  and experience your full potential  i think this is my full potential  i know youre skeptical pete i know  here i want you to do something pull my hair  right now go ahead pull my hair  im just kidding its real  im not like you  so be honest with me what did jack say  i guess he thinks that tracy is a movie star  and he doesnt love it that you did those commercials  well you tell him that those commercials paid for my vacation home  so unless he would like to buy me a condo in clearwater florida  jenna im sorry just let it go  tracys doing conan tonight  liz lemon we got a problem  grizz and dotcom say tracys doctor put him on some new medication  i guess hes

dr spaceman  oh brother look around we have to find his medication  dr spaceman dr spaceman  wow dr spaceman i owe you an apology tray  this is dr leo spachemen  hi  i work with tracy jordan and i think hes having  a reaction to some of the medication you put him on  ah i was afraid this might happen  you know hes on so many different neuroleptics and tricyclics that theres no telling how theyll mix  but what can you do  medicines not a science  what exactly are you treating him for  theres not really a name for what tracy has  basically its erratic tendencies and delusions brought on by excessive notoriety  and certainly not helped by my wildly experimental treatments  boy im being awfully open with you miss  i should not have taken those blue things  so is he dangerous  no he should be fine so long as you keep him away from bright lights loud music and crowds  ill call in a prescription for something to settle him down  as soon as possible  uhdo you need anything for yourself  what no  just where can i pick up tracys prescription  ms lemon they need you upstairs in mr donaghys office immediately  kenneth i need you to go to ritedrug  yes sir  what is it whats the emergency  hows this for an opening line  when i first met jack welch i thought he was such a great golfer  he made bob darnell look like randy barnes  thats fine do that  i dont know  might be distasteful if randys widows in the audience  what did you come up with  i have a bigger problem jack i dont think tracys ready to do conan  i think you should let jenna do it and maybe tracy could do it in a couple of weeks  jennas not a star  shes capable but shes not a star  shes got a movie coming out next month  what movie  the rrr jrr  the what  tracys acting nuts   hes having problems with
