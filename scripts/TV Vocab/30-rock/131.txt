to our destination wedding  here on the love boat  unfortunately sol has discovered  my previous relationship with gopher  so he will be seeking an annulment  once we reach puerto vallarta  i realized a long time ago that weddings arent about love  theyre just a giant industry that preys on gender stereotypes  to make adult women spend a ton of money  and act like selfish children  i mean have you seen wedding bitches on bravo  maybe theres not going to be a wedding  youre ruining my special day  ma what the are you wearing  i remember when bravo used to air operas  i reject the wedding industrys  phallocentric fairy tale grotesquerie  so tomorrow liz lemon is getting married  in a sweatshirt no bra  for gods sakes lemon  dont take a stand about your own wedding  think about that kid youre trying to adopt  what will you tell him if he asks to see pictures  i will tell her or it that i took an amazing stand  against the wedding industrial complex  we are registered at popcorn palace  all right  now that ive finished  with my handwriting sample for the fbi  lets look at your test results  this is puzzling tracy  there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with you at all  what  i guess weve replaced  so much of you over the years  that youre maybe not you anymore  but youre healthy  no this isnt happening  this is good news  no its not  i always assumed id die young  because you know i look so much like james dean  and that gave me the freedom to live without consequences  thats why im always breaking the law  buying exotic sharks forgetting to feed them  and then trying to hug them  i couldnt do cool stuff like that  if i knew id be alive for  how many years dr spaceman   im sorry  look im not happy about this either  the money ive made off your health problems  has put me almost all the way through medical school  im going to have to start living like theres a tomorrow  open an ira brush my teeth  drink eight glasses a day of that stuff  you know clear bathtub juice  tracy im afraid i dont have a pamphlet  to help you get through this  but i do have a pamphlet that has a bunch  of drawings of vaginas  ill take it  to make a long story short  i need to be let out of my tgs contract  im moving to arizona to be with my new slave master terry  to live in a birdcage he built  why dont you both have a seat  you may sit  now terry i suspect you know its illegal  for someone to own another human being  fine but according to the contest rules  either i collect my prize or her equivalent cash value  i see  so youd be just as happy with the money  terry is this true  ive done the math and taking into account  jennas salary and earning potential  ive calculated that shes worth 800000  lets say jenna was worth that in her prime  that was ten years ago  she has certainly depreciated since then  jenna is becoming more unemployable by the moment  and thanks to decades of partying  jennas internal organs will get you nothing  on the black market  shes an emotional train wreck  daddy why are you doing this  a seventh grade education hepatitis d  bullet in jaw fatwa credit card debt  wanted by the yakuza  jenna maroney is worth  2000  fine  in arizona two grand will buy me a castle  and a pillowcase full of meth  make it out to doomsday enterprises  goodbye bitey  well i guess i need to read all of these scripts  to determine which one has the greatest probability  of succeeding in this ever changing global marketplace  i used to only say stuff like that  in my white nerd voice  jeez i feel like were at a deli  deli save it for the honeymoon  okay you take our paperwork to the clerk  because black women love you  i see you over there you little gumdrop  dont hide from shanice  ill get us some witnesses and then well get married

a piece of paper  thats us thats our number  come on our number  you okay  yeah you know i just thought  thered be more people here in gym clothes  carrying bags full of toilet paper  look we dont have to do it this way  you know i always imagined getting married  right when they take your picture  on splash mountain  but weddings are about the bride  so if you want your special day  i dont need a special day  you know the first wedding i ever went to  i was a flower girl for my aunt linda  when they said you may now kiss the bride  i did my first ever eye roll  and today i honor that little girls eye roll  with this masterpiece  thats how much liz lemon cares about having a special day  great cause i forgot my birth certificate  are you kidding me chros  and even though shanice said  shed let it slide if i sat on her hand  what  liz lemon i havent seen anything in the news  about attitudes towards marriage changing forever  because of one brave woman  is everything okay  everythings fine  i emailed tony bennett  just in case you came to your senses  hes singing at the white house but will cancel for me  also i told him youre italian  so he might call you tina  okay so well take another number  ill get some witnesses  youll get your birth certificate  its not wedding stress  im no more annoyed right now  than i was when you got that haircut  without consulting me  yeah  you can walk away from me all day you little tiger cub  i work at the marriage bureau but ill never get married  sir we have a big problem  i didnt want anyone to see me like this she lied  jenna when i said what you were worth  that was a negotiation tactic  2000 jack  ive stolen more than that from my cleaning ladys purse  in this market 2000 is more than respectable  i mean look at kenneth  hes worth 5 tops  im going to hold you to that sir  is that supposed to make me feel better  everyone around here is human garbage  okay well then look at me  if youre past your prime then so am i  ive been divorced twice  im at an age where i no longer need erectile softeners  im number two at an american television company  with no possibility of promotion  ill probably die in this job  ive already had one heart attack  i used to be a young man with promise  i coined the phrase you wish pal  but now im sitting here  trying to cheer up a 2000 actress  because a janitor said i hurt her feelings so  god  im worth less than you  thank you jack  what are you doing why did you change your clothes  well this is what i was wearing  when we met in riverside park  remember you said nice turtleneck  no i said  nice turtleneck  and thank you again  great so now youre more dressed up  than i am at my own wedding  but whatever i got witnesses  these guys were in the park  either fighting or having sex  okay well i thought it might be nice  to have a witness we actually know  of course it had to be someone  with nothing to do on a wednesday afternoon  no no no you didnt  mazel tov dummies  youre jewish right liz  my god what is wrong with you  you forgot your birth certificate  you invited dennis  if you cant take this seriously  maybe theres not going to be a wedding  okay is this a big deal or not  i dont know  its not the most important day of my life  getting my show picked up or meeting you  or the time i got a sleeve of starburst with all pink  those were all more important days  so youre yelling at me because  because im liz lemon  my parents spent the money they saved up for my wedding  on a pt cruiser  i have been sure for a long time  that this was never going to happen  and i was fine with it  ergo it couldnt matter  ergo  afflecks finally going to get that oscar  and im still 90 right  its stupid it doesnt matter  guess what  you wasted a lot of money on that dress  actually it was my grandmothers  she made it out of parachute silk  while hiding from the germans  shut up  and then you came along  and now were doing this  and a tiny little part of me that i hate  wants to be a princess  liz its okay to be a human woman  no its not its the worst  because of society  i mean why do you watch wedding bitches  in the first place  and why did i find this hidden under your underwear ball  sol rosenbear  he never got enough time in his garden before he passed  i want today to be special  god do you have any idea  how hard it was to get you to admit that  i forgot my birth certificate  lets invite dennis  you were playing me  ill wear my stupid turtleneck  wait you think its stupid  were going to get married today  but were going to do it right  we need rings and flowers  and im going to put on deodorant  and youre going to wear a suit  that makes you look like a little marzipan candy man  so lets go people its my special day  the
