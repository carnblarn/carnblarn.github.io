for the reunion sex  lemon isnt it wonderful  dont dare say anything about what i told you about my secret  im not going to because you have to  baby cried the day the circus came to town    uh you okay  oh i didnt see you there  im fine  dont cry out loud   you sure you dont want to talk about something  well its kinda none of your business but all right  i met this cute paramedic yesterday  he thinks im incredible were perfect for each other  but he left before i could get his name  well im sure theres a way to find out  i called 911 they wouldnt even connect me to their celebrity service  i dont know what to do  you know your dilemma reminds me of a book i read once   see ya later pete  no no listen listen  theres this question psychiatrists use to identify sociopaths  a woman goes to her mothers funeral  where she meets the perfect man its love at first sight  but he leaves before she finds out who he is so  what does she do to see him again  she kills her father hoping that the guy will come to that funeral too  thats correct oh boy   thanks for the advice  no no no that wasnt advice  but of course shed also have to kill her fathers doorman  and anyone else who might have seen her  and you for giving her the idea in the first place   liz lemon you dummy  im wearing it as a joke  i asked angie what she wanted for our anniversary  and she wants me to get a tattoo of her name  oh okay you like tattoos  and above it she wants this picture of her face  i cant have this on my chest scaring off beautiful women in the clubs   tracy  you know i like to socialize liz lemon  and you know my signature move with the ladies   is taking off my shirt  is taking off your shirt  now its a sophies choice  i cant get this tattoo and i cant tell angie no  what do you want me to say tracy  im sorry i made it harder for you to cheat on your wife  thats a start liz lemon thats a start  strawberries  my real name is diplin  oh somebody call the cute guy at 911  lemon i need to ask you something about elisa  did she say anything to you anything at all about a secret   desire to keep her maiden name  oh no sorry  because id like her to be elisa donaghy  but if she wants to be elisa padriera donaghy  elisa padriera ah   viuva negra  what   what does that mean  the black widow  elisa has a terrible secret my current theory is  shes the mother of those michael jacksons kids  okay i searched elisa padriera and the black widow  but all the web sites are in spanish   blue writing on green why  call that cleaning lady back   we need somebody who speaks spanish  i speak spanish   puerto rican  la viuva negra  really lemon   jack let me explain  elisa there is nothing you can say  that will change the way i feel  im so sorry to tell you such a dark tale  while wearing such a silly tshirt  i was married once and i killed my husband  it was a crime of passion  he cheated on me  and in a rage i took my revenge  you know me jack  im a catholic  i take the bonds of marriage very seriously   why arent you in jail  they threw my case out  i couldnt get an impartial jury after that song about me came out  elisa elisa   la viuda negra   elisa   i guess im glad you know  i understand if this changes everything  its up to you  my god  i already put my wedding announcement in cigar aficionado  how about this you get the tattoo  but when you hit the clubs  you draw a mane around the face with a marker  and make it look like a lion named tangiers  dotcom that is a great idea  if you want everyone to think i own a gay lion   tangiers  no judgment in brainstorming  look this is my reputation were talking about here  use your heads  the moroccan national soccer team is the lions  tangiers is in morocco  so yeah i guess im an idiot  have you ever met anyone thats killed somebody  i think my grandpa may have  but he never really liked to talk about what happened at kent state  i still want to marry elisa   wow you do really  so she had one bad day  being in a relationship means overlooking certain flaws  i mean somewhere right now  a guy is on a jdate with monica lewinsky  nobodys perfect   jack  im 50  to put it in perspective thats like 32 for ladies  how many more elisas am i going to meet  okay well god bless  i guess i just really dont understand men  nobody ever said you did lemon  nyah  pardon me excuse me  im sorry what are you two doing here  wheres the hot guy  maam are you taking any medication  yes wheres the cute paramedic who was here last night  he was wearing a uniform he was totally into me  if he was here at night he must work the evening shift  so there are different shifts  like on a sheiks pleasure yacht  thank you  lemon  its not product placement i just like it   what  what  what if i marry elisa and i accidentally cheat  she could snap again  shes very passionate and she doesnt react well to betrayal  why wont you open  yes what a quandary oh wait i have a suggestion   dont cheat  but you never know lemon  what if i find myself stranded in a snow cave  with a stern but comely lady geologist  both of us knowing that our only chance for survival  is the heat from our naked bodies   sorry i just do not get you guys  again that is not being disputed  but my options for male advice around here are limited  so i think the pranksmen should all wear fedoras   could the hats have feathers  yes yes  face it you are the closest thing to a man working here right now  well dude  i guess you gotta find a comely geologist and a snow cave and see what happens  tracy i need your help  my fiancee murdered her exhusband when he cheated on her   continue  i love her  but the only way i can make sure that i wont stray  is for me to arrange a test of erotic temptation   yes  exactly  were going out tonight jackie d  and youre gonna be tempted like jesus in the wilderness  jesus is my stereo guy and the wilderness is a club i took him to once  jenna come quick kenneths passed out again  oh no i cant believe this is happening during night shift  oh for god sakes what is this third watch  somehow kenneth ate strawberries again  and now hes gone into acute strawberry shock   is that a thing  just ask this real emt  were gonna have to cut off his hands to get the sickness out  hes gonna have to learn how to urinate with his feet   how could this have happened again  its my fault i did it  i just wanted that hot emt to come back i didnt mean for it to go this far  oh kenneth im so sorry but i am not a monster  im just a girl standing in front of a boy she poisoned  so this other boy would go to town on her   i think shes had enough sirs  aw kenneth  whats happening is this a trick i knew it  i was just playing along no seriously whats happening  jenna do you feel genuine remorse  thank god  sociopath downgraded to extreme narcissist  now quit it with the strawberry stuff  or you might once again feel the righteous lash  of the pranksmen  is that a thing  hey tray   you and your friend wanna party later  sure thing baby  give the kid a call   holla  this is decadent  and i once went to miami with darryl strawberry  tip of the iceberg jackie d  you can have all of this whenever you want  or you can marry that nice lady that youre in love with   its up to you  look i love elisa   but you love angie right  of course i do angies the one  the one where did you hear that  its a thing i made up after seeing the matrix  well elisa is my one but tracy  sometimes i think men like us arent built for marriage  okay this is something ive never told anyone  this is my terrible secret  in the 20 years that ive known her  ive never cheated on my wife  there i said it  dont look at me  wait a minute that cant be the truth  the partying is just for show  and because im a highfunctioning alcoholic  all the phone numbers you see me hand out  theyre not even mine  hello  no this isnt tracy jordan  really  ive not heard of that term before  do you know how to get to connecticut  oh my god thats an inspiration   i mean if you can do it  so can you  because im a ridiculous unstable human being  what is wrong with me  i mean if elisas only flaw is that she demands i be faithful  then i will be faithful  and if angie wants me to get a tattoo of her to prove my love   then im getting that tattoo  grizz get the car dotcom get the coats  and which one of you ladies wants to pick up the tab  oh me me  i put strawberry juice in your chickpeas  and in your water   and on your harmonica  my what  oh you mean my mouth radio  i am so sorry kenneth  i just want you to know that i would not do this to you for just any guy  he was special  i really thought that he was   the one  oh miss maroney  its horrible to think you might have found your true love   but only to lose him  it hurts more than my foot botox  to know that hes out there and i have no way to find him  when you call 911  tell them they have to send everyone   earn this  oh  you remarkable son of a bitch  we have an emergency  workin on my night cheese   oh jack  do you know what time it is i was sound asleep  i heard you singing night cheese  lemon ive had a crazy night  we all can learn a lot from tracy jordan  we went out clubbing his life is like enron 1999   its wild  im sure it was  how are you so quiet when your parades are so loud  you were supposed to be thinking about us  and you spent the whole night partying with that black guy   did she not come here with you  have you been following me  and then you come here at 400 in the morning  i knew your relationship was too weird not to be sexual  okay everybody be cool  wait a minute youre jealous of lemon thats insane  yeahcome on look at me   ooh  elisa i proved to myself tonight  that i would never cheat on you thats why i went out with tracy  and i came to lizs because   because shes your bro  exactly   oh  elisa this is troubling  and how do you think i feel  i get a ring on my finger for one day and i start acting

lawsuit over your exercise tape  even better i had an amazing date last night   and its all thanks to kenneth  oh it was nothing  sure i was legally dead for five minutes   but i did it for true love
