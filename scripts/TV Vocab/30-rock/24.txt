destroy them  ill give them to someone a fellow ceramiphile  youre like john kerry with his windsurfing  i warned him too  howd it go with angie  terrible she hates me shes hijacking the show  i got to talk to jack  you want a scary black lady to be nice to you  tell her you like her nails  always works for me at the bank  miss lemon may i speak with you  sure can you walk and talk  usually but now you got me thinking about it  jenna with problem i have  there it is  im supposed to be helping miss maroney stay fat  but its not working  how do i get her to eat  well a lot of women overeat  because they feel bad about themselves  maybe thats the problem  everythings going so well for miss maroney right now  yeah so be mean to her  women with low selfesteem take refuge in either food or sex  not me of course  hi i just wanted to meet you mr mason im a really big fan  who picked out your outfit stevie wonder  hey hey hey  nice man  so you got to be mean kenneth  i guess i could wait for her to drop something  and then say smooth move exlax  thats what my moms friend ron would do  oh brother  all right jenna really wants this huh  her career depends on it please help  okay do you have something to write on  oh i got one  sir someone else called about purchasing your collection  a mr gary heingarten  no jonathan he lives in albany  the temperature fluctuations alone would  these things expand and contract  theyre alive jonathan  hey do you have a minute  tracys wife is  whats with the cookie jar  i collect them  really is that some sort of unresolved childhood thing  nice try  we never had any cookie jars in my home  because our mother never baked us any cookies  cause she never felt we deserved any cookies  so obviously it has nothing to do with my childhood  but that cookie jar says mom on it  uh i dont think so  ive always viewed it as an upsidedown wow  but it doesnt matter now because i have to um  get rid of them all  why  because the guy with the weird hobby  never gets the corner office  lemon what is going on on your stage right now  oh this is what i came to talk to you about  tracys wife is out of control  did you tell her you like her fingernails  no  but i thought that we could give her a consultant credit  its meaningless but it might calm her down  lemon im impressed  youre beginning to think like a businessman a businesswoman  i dont think thats a word  unfortunately what youve gotten yourself into  is not a business situation but a family conflict  so its tricky  so what do i do about angie  i think youre gonna have to fight her  what yeah  you throw her out shell probably punch you in the face  then we eject her from the building  and we bar her for life  i think angies righthanded  so you have to work her clockwise  youve already thought about fighting her  every time i meet a person i figure how im gonna fight them  you have a gimpy left knee right  im not gonna fight anybody  im gonna give her the title and shell back off  lemon youre gonna get hit in the face  and its gonna hurt like hell  you want to lean in to take away their momentum  hands up come on  i dont want to lean in come on  oh god stop it  hello jenna  still failing at overeating  just like you fail at everything in your life  what you quitter  you gonna quit this like you quit fashion school  give up like you gave up  on your relationship with david blaine  hes the one who drove the wedge  with his magic  also youve got so many daddy issues  the only thing keeping you from being a stripper  is your weird mole  kenneth  thats very hurtful  you lied about your brother drowning  so people would come to your onewoman show  kenneth ive never heard you talk this way  your toes look like driedup shrimps  oh  oh daddy  go on keep talking  what else dont you like about me  can i help you  yes  angie i know you and i got off on the wrong foot here  but i want you to know  that i appreciate your contribution to the show  and so i want to offer you a consultant credit  i dont want that crap title  you think youre gonna buy me off so ill play nice  its never gonna happen  okay  im ordering you to leave  excuse me  get your stuff and get out dont make me say it again  no liz lemon dont do it  are you steppin up on me  so what if i am also your nails look tacky  oh wait a minute  enough damn it enough  do i have to fix this situation  i am the immature one  but the both of you  youre forcing me to act like an adult  an adult  and even worse  youre making me stop two ladies from going at it  but i dont care  cause im putting my foot down  youre putting your foot down with me  uhhuh  baby you got to go  youre controlling  youre manipulative youre loud  tracy ive never heard you talk like that before  hey let me get this shirt off  get it off  okay so just to be clear  does this mean angie is leaving or  oh no you guys start with that  that wow  that is  mr donaghy ive got some bad news  i wasnt able to get miss maroney to eat  im so sorry  what happened  well it turns out shes the wrong kind of crazy  and i guess we have to get married now  apology accepted kenneth  i suppose were both having a pretty bad day  ha  look at that kooky old cookie jar  i like the upsidedown wow on it  you like cookie jars kenneth  well i guess ive never thought about it that much  we had a nice one back home in georgia  had a bear on it  i remember when my moms friend ron would come over  theyd go into the bedroom to sort out their paperwork  and id just go ahead and stare at that cookie jar  it was almost as if i took every problem that i ever had  and i put it inside that cookie jar  and i sealed it up so tight  that nothing would never ever ever get out  so i guess to answer your question  id give cookie jars about a b  some people have so many problems  that there arent enough cookie jars in the world  to contain them  well that just makes me sad  kenneth i have a cookiejar collection  would you like to have it  of course sir id love to  always hold them squarely at the base never by the lid  and should you ever go to the convention in sarasota  please tell patty and beth and all of them  that vic nightingale says hello  okay sir  are you happy now you son of a bitch  you son of a bitch  grassisima  balena  grassota  ooh  enorme  enorme  como ti amo  porcella
