                lemon  i just got my bridesmaids dress  for ceries wedding  it is a vietnamese size two  dressing up isnt any easier for men  do you know what its like when a younger man shows up  wearing the same cufflinks  you might as well be invisible  yeah well im not gonna let this dress win  i have a plan this morning i joined   a suicide cult  a gym  what do you want jack  i just received a call from don geiss  estate lawyer  apparently ive been named in his will  i know this is a difficult time for you  but word of advice  if the will says that you have to spend the night  in a haunted house you better hope  that everybody else there is black guys and sluts  i just want something to remember the man by   okay  his pen or his tie clip  maybe that boyhood sled he held so dear  i believed he called it  sleddy  something which i in turn  can then pass on to my protege  any chance its one of those  bendy hospital beds  maybe he did have three  he was such an amazing man   before we rehearse  i have an announcement to make  our boy grizz is getting married on may 22nd  jeez another wedding  life is like tv  testing tells us that people like weddings births  and episodes where a character dies  thats dumb  my heart  so i thought grizz might want to take this time  to announce whos gonna be his best man  umi havent decided yet  um i havent decided yet  you sound like my mother  talking to the planned parenthood lady  seriously which one of your rich and famous friends  with hepatitis b are you going to pick  lets not do this in front of everybody  lets not do this in front of everybody  you sound like my mother being pulled onstage  at a 2 live crew concert  damn  my mother had problems  oh brother we have to tell jenna  we cant do her kardashian sketch  because jack is bros with lamar odom  you are such a coward  you think i care what you think  hey jenna  so look we cant do the kardashian sketch  okay i understand  pete there you are you  i heard one of your kids broke his arm  oh uh yeah  the shed i built collapsed on him  well is he gonna be okay  whats going on  why are you being so happy and nice  are you soaking your tampo in vodka again  because the glue is abrasive  but im really happy  is there any chance  this might make our lives easier  no way i have seen this 100 times  she gets psyched about some guy  he reveals himself to be crazy  then theres a terrible breakup  and we suffer  remember when she dated that sniper  and so its over  jenna theres a laser sight on your forehead  oh please hes not gonna fire  for gods sakes hes scared of his own mother  arent cha alan  aah  whoever this new guy is  we need to figure out his deal  before she gets burned and takes it out on us  tell me about it  remember this breakup when she bit me  pete that was like two years ago  it just wont heal  that concludes mr geiss financial disbursements  i believe all have been accounted for  his daughter his lovely wife  his even lovelier mistress  the secret canadian family  and his even more secret attic family  l that remains are a few personal items  to my daughter cathy  i bequeath my pocket watch  it comes with very specific instructions for care  the most important of which  is to not let the piece get wet  to my protege and friend john francis donaghy  i leave a gift  from the gardens of my estate in connecticut  my beloved pet peacock argus  hello old friend  ugh vietnamese size two  beth i hope it wasnt awkward for you  when tracy brought up my wedding  why would it be awkward  because of our sexual past  leave it open id feel safer  how could i help you grizz  well tracy keeps pushing  to be your best man  yeah i noticed that  but i wanna pick dotcom and  and youre afraid that tracy will freak out  so you want me to help you convince him to step aside  you know my every thought beth  we really were the sam and diane of this place  no  liz pete  i want you to meet someone  this is my boyfriend paul   pete hornberger  hey  but you can call me dallas  this could be the start of something for me  its really nice to meet you  and im a big fan of the show  yeah so paul whats your deal  how did you guys meet  through a mutual fund  friend jenna  oh of course through a friend fund  noted  and what do you do for a living paul  oh i work for a bank  rupt circus  he works for a bankrupt circus  okay hes hiding something  im guessing  alreadymarried cat strangler  hmm  hey could i just get a signa  agh living dinosaur  lemon  this is argus  he was a gift from don geiss  dons last gift to be exact  why did don geiss have a peacock  is that an nbc thing  no don owned argus long before he bought nbc  peacocks can live up to 40 years  longer if theyre not part of mike tysons home zoo  ohh what a weird gift  not at all  when don was first taking me under his wing  he and i would sit on the veranda  of his home in connecticut  talking about business politics  how to avoid getting paper cuts while making love  on a pile of money  and our friend argus would strut proudly through the garden  we three peacocks felt like we owned the world  well thats a  how did he get up here so quick  you know i never told anybody this before lemon  but don and i had nicknames for each other  like we might someday jtown  we called each other sempai and kohai  master and pupil  terms we learned on a trip to japan  because they played the movie rising sun on the airplane  don was my sempai  now this bird is all that remains  jack im really sorry for your  oh his feather went in my mouth  ew its so oily  lemon hes marked you  he thinks youre his wife  go get out  yah  hey tracy  grizz and i were just talking  of course you guys are very close  continue  and we had an amazing idea  we thought that maybe at the wedding  you could be the lead singer of the band  really id be awesome at that  you would  now of course you couldnt sing and  but whos gonna tell you two  the wedding band is u2  no you two idiots  i see what youre trying to do  youre trying to manipulate me  into not being the best man  and damn it grizz  ive known you since you was six feet tall  im gonna be your best man  i am the leader of this entourage  and because of you im having a tantrum  now pick up that table and smash it for me  thats right  i know that  hey jenna  what are you doing  im just feeling the weight  of jennas jewelry on my finger pads  pete  pete  ugh dallas  whats up  paul is getting weirder  weve got to step it up  you know what we should do we should follow him  i dont care how long it takes  whats going on  your kids have a play tonight  oklahoma  they couldnt find cowboy hats big enough  for my kids head  so theyre just wearing turbans  its on when paul leaves we follow him  cia style  and afterwards i go to the gym  words are the first step on the road to deeds  you wanted to see me sir  oh my what a gorgeous swamp eagle  this is argus  he is very special to me   is he okay  i dont know  hes become listless  and he wont eat any of the peacock food  i got at the crazy rich persons pet store  frankly i dont know what to do  hes recently taken a mate  lemon  good luck argus  well sir theres nothing wrong with this bird  hes just very old  argus probably doesnt have very long to live  all of your page duties stop right now  the welfare of this bird is your only concern  he livesor you die  i was about to suggest the same thing  hey dummy  what are you doing to grizz  whoa you watch your mouth  before i show you the back of my hand  look you gotta grow up about this best man thing  liz lemon i dont even want to be best man  why would i  show up one time not lose a ring  keep my shirt on through a dinner psh  then why are you throwing a fit about it  because im trying to protect dotcom dummy  hes in love with grizzs fiancee  feyonce  oh your stutter is back  no grizzs fiancees name is feyonce  like beyonce with an f   ah come on  listen  we cannot make dotcom  get up there and give a speech at that wedding  itd kill him  wow i cant believe that you are using  your infantile selfishness for good  im impressed tracy  you think thats impressive  watch me stand on one foot  hang on i did it earlier  youre right tracy  youve got to convince grizz to choose you  no you do  why do i have to do everything  oh i am never gonna fit in that dress  bored  what ohh  thats a bar  were gonna have to drink a lot to fit in  i dont understand where he went  can i get five more beers here  names dallas  i dont get it did we lose him  what if hes in a secret back room doing pot  ladies and gentlemen put your hands together  for miss jinah baloney  what did he say  is that jenna  no its paul   my muffin top is all that    whole grain low fat    i know you want a piece of that    but i just want to dance   im jenna naturally  jennas boyfriend is a jenna maroney impersonator     work it miss thang  oh god  im gonna need five more cranberry juices over here  jack i just found out that jenna  is dating a guy who does a drag showas her  lemon what is with this food layout  kenneth says he needs some sumac bark  and shrub yellow root  to make a poultice for argus  how is your thing weirder than mine  i  i am not letting that bird die  and why does he have to  for gods sakes if we can put an ear  on a mouses back  we can certainly make a peacock immortal  oh jack i know this is important to you  but it is just a bird  i mean do you think maybe youre so worked up about argus  because you never let yourself grieve for don  i did grieve for don  as soon as jack welch told me  i went through all five stages of grief  don is dead  what  you didnt do anything   let me retell it  in slow motion  don is dead     see  sir i just wanted to let you know  argus is sleeping  and you left him alone  what if he rolls over on his back  and his cloaca fills with mucous  oh brother this is not about some peacock  were gonna have to help him kenneth  i have an idea but youre gonna have to take the lead  because i am stretched pretty thin  well not new york thin but  dont worry im on it ms lemon  sorrymrs argus  okay  beth i need you to do something for me  yeah actually i need to talk to you  about the wedding  im too upset to talk  look at me  whats this  grizz has asked me to read this to both of you  dear friends  i dont want any more fighting or bad feelings  tracy i love you but ive known dotcom  ever since we went to above the beanstalk  a free summer camp for giants  i want him to be my best man  and if you care

ooh thats a car alarm  kenneth whats your point  its just ive never in all my life  heard a peacock say  sempai and kohai  what did you say  sempai and kohai  at least thats what it sounded like  kenneth ive been under a lot of strain lately  but do you believe a human soul  could be transferred into an animal vessel  sir i think that theres a lot about this world  that we dont understand  like the afterlife  or how bread turns into toast  liz  i am in love with grizzs fiancee feyonce  oh my god  i definitely didnt know that  would you talk to grizz and convince him  tracy should be his best man  okay yeah ill try to help  but can i please go to the gym first  no  hello  badger  its another badger  the third badger has taken the bait  why is everyone code named badger  i thought you

about you and your bride  so who cares what anyone thinks  love isnt judgmental  love is patient  love isweird  and sometimes gross  love is elusive  and you found it  so treasure it  and maybe dont
