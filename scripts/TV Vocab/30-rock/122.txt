guy pilot guy cleveland dude  british guy rich dude james franco  ive been with the same woman for 22 years  no judgments but to me liz lemon is a sex maniac  well a lady never goes anywhere without a date   can someone watch virginia  i cant  contractually i can only hold beautiful black babies  in benetton ads  and i dont know if i should  cause im might bite these fat little legs  i might eat them up theyre so fat and juicy  chuckles  no sam the military brings her back  dont even let clinton know about this  he and steve bing will break out their sex plane  it is a sex plane  there arent even any seats  its just futons and jacuzzis  ive gotta run sam  jack i god what is this  oh its just one of our shows  theyre following me today  ugh is this one of those ridiculous reality shows  like ken burnss jazz disgusting  im sorry diana ignore them  eventually you wont even know theyre here  im just a little overwhelmed right now  i could use a drink  im afraid that while were on camera  i can only offer you dfwans boutique wine dfwine  dfwine  please dfwink responsibly  to averys return  im a part of this as well  i played avery in the tv movie kidnapped by danger  jenna this is for family only  chuckles  now you sound like the cops outside of jackie os funeral  but i got in there  and sang almost all of hey big spender   the m  jenna this is inappropriate  i suggest you go back to  whatever florida bathroom you crawled out of  i can see im not wanted here  but thank you for looking up on wikipedia  that i was conceived on a toilet  no one wants me in their story  sobbing  if a beautiful woman cries and no one hears it  did she waste 700 on crying lessons  at adrian brodys unaccredited acting school  jack when avery does get back  i dont think we should tell her about us  spits  oh bleep  i want to make sure we all were very clear  about what my mother in law said in my office  she said we shouldnt tell avery about gus  gus is someone ive gone into business with  and avery wouldnt approve of him  why would she disapprove  uh well uh because they dated at yale  gus was a professor  of course youll meet him  we do business all the time  tracy i know youre planning  a big romantic surprise for me  at the end of the fashion show  but jack donaghy is messing with my special day  so whatever you were thinking about doing double it  call monique  do a dove release  parachute in and propose to me all over again you hear  angie i wasnt even gonna go to your fashion show  its at 800  which is 900 am tokyo time  thats when takashis parents leave for work  and we play mass effect 3 online  laughs  mr and mrs tanaka think hes at school  but hes playing video games with a drunk adult  now i know youre just saying that  because you dont want to ruin the surprise  cause youre a good husband  oh my god  ned stark is dead  i love my wife  i want her to be happy  but more than that im gonna do nothing  its hard trying to have it all  you wait here bernardo  baby babbling  she bit my bleep  eew  my glasses  its work its work  but she is at such a fun age  you get so much out of it  its fine im fine  if everything goes according to plan  avery will be back in a few days  in the meantime i have a lot of work to do  with gus my business partner  whom diana mentioned earlier  gus theres gus  why are you wearing the hat  i asked you not to wear any more to our meetings  were higher up here  so the suns electricity is stronger  well uh lets go over the numbers gus  as you can see the numbers look pretty good  were under budget and in line with projections  great well uh meeting over  you probably shouldnt have even filmed that it was so boring  oh diana you remember gus whom you said we shouldnt tell  avery about because she used to date him  she was nasty  she loved pee   thank you gus  no jack  i didnt say gus  i already explained to them what i said  i said i did not want avery to know about rus  in slavic myth rus is the founder of russia  why cant avery know about  the mythological founder of russia  because jack has invested a lot of money in a restaurant  im opening called rus  it is russian cuisine  who doesnt love cold purple soup  diana were talking about the same thing  because as you know  the restaurant rus is the business venture  im engaged in with gus  right he is the chef  as i mentioned earlier hes a professor at yale  which is funny  because he looks so much more like a chef  oh whats funniest is thats hes both  and now he works at the restaurant  we cant tell avery about  and the grand opening is tonight  now hes opening up a restaurant  the same night my line launches  oh that is a bridge too far  thats right  i read world war ii history motherbleep  well nobodys going to care about his restaurant  when theres a fashion show going on in the middle of it  and a big surprise from my husband  eliza beth  this is very very easy for me  to say to you but you cant come in here right now  wha l just wanna drop off this  little crinkly book that i got for virginia  i cant let you in  after what happened betwixt you this morning  no virginia is not having you  what are you talking about  i might bite these fat little legs  theyre so fat and juicy  rude  whit was a compliment  thats a thing people say to babies  you never talk about a black womans leg size  not on babies not on the williams sisters  not on a mannequin at avenue  we have come too far  now you know me girl  i dont really  i stay above these feuds  did i get involved when portia took  the overthecounter colon health test in the bathroom  at randis domestic violence costume ball  i did but i didnt want to  can i be honest  i think im just anxious  for virginia to love me because ive been thinking  about motherhood lately  i have a serious biend right now and  lisa dfwan doesnt talk about people behind their backs  so im just gonna tell you straight to your face  that what youre saying right now is very boring  all i know is im gonna stay out  of this fight between you and virginia  that baby is a piece of work  you know she should be able to stack blocks  in a tower by now but she wont do it  i thought you didnt talk about people behind their backs  hi  go away  rude  down down  boom right there  god these flower arrangements  you people are savages  just excited  wait youre putting spoons in those  its just knives and forks  why am i even doing this  i still have to get the menus from the printer  go to the cony island beet market  ive gotta pick up yakov smirnov at the airport  thats enough foil gus  jack its been a year that we prayed  for this restaurant opening  and i should just feel excited and relieved but  its complicated  when you open a restaurant with your mother in law  hey everyone knows youre not talking about the restaurant  youre talking about electricity  both chuckle  thank you gus  theres the gang  virginia  its aunt jenna  look  i heard what liz said about you  and i just have to say  that i have known liz a long long long time  and shes totally shady  oh my god you are hilarious  do you act  because we should do a movie together  where were on a road trip just being sluts  high five  no i dont care that the others went to  pierre batalini salon without me  its not a feud i just  ive never spent much time with babies okay  and what if im bad at it  sobbing this is good tv  i would watch this  i would feel for liz  isnt this usually a bathroom  no tray its usually lutzs office  i see  i think i just solved the mystery of the phantom peeper  whats wrong ll  you look like angie when i tell her i wanna retire  and live in an old lighthouse  its just dfwan and everybody  are saying that im in a fight with virginia  which is idiotic because shes a baby  maybe its just that children in general dont like you  thank you tracy  i am dealing with something real here  but all anyone wants to do on these dumb shows  is fight and scream and throw things  i wouldnt know i really dont watch tv  im more of a masturbator  well im about to get original on you tracy  there is no such thing as reality on reality television  grunts  microphone feedback  youre happy now america  no  yes  welcome to rus  this evening were serving all the pierogis costco had  and then burger king  thats a sharp look kenneth  thank you sir but i cant take all the credit  everything i know about fashion i learned  from my old college roommate john mark karr  right this way  oh for gods sake  youve got a lot of nerve coming here  you know this is virginias night  you have no class  you prostitution whore  what are you talking about  im hitching my wagon to virginias star  trying to get a little camera tiempo  jenna youve had cameras following you around all day  youre a star now

hasnt said hi yet  honey what was that chuckles  okay liz i dont know what shes talking about  but virginia said she knows what you just did for jack  she misjudged you and she would like a hug  gasps  the feuds over  its all good  now im just looking forward to this trip  because virginia loves her little giraffe so much  the show is sending us on a girls getaway to somalia  whoop whoop  videogame

gave you a kidney a kneecap and a bladder  but i ask you to do one thing and you cant do it  all i wanted was a standing ovation and for people to tweet  that i was the new icon for black womanhood  and then for me to tweet why just black womanhood  instead i got nothing  i might as well be daphne  who  im daphne  i handle conflict appropriately  and im up to date on my mortgage payments  oh no i turned what was supposed to be  a boring romantic evening into a gigantic fight  in front of all these cameras  yes  how inconsiderate of you to cause all this drama  and start this riveting fight
