this is me  exactly  you dont get to give dating advice  you sent a letter to scott peterson  after he dyed his hair and got super thin from all the stress  are you kidding me he was smokin  dennis is a good guy okay  not really  so when did this happen  well last week was my birthday and everyone forgot except dennis  and he called and we went out and it wasnt too weird  and how is the sex  fast

were you born  1977   when did you graduate high school  94   when do you turn 40  2017   junior high crush  kirk cameron   prom theme  motownphilly boyz ii men   what movie did you lose your virginity at  arachnophobia  theater or drivein  whats a drivein  of course  i dont know why i bothered to ask  i can tell just from your physical appearance that youre obviously   so these page numbers  when done correctly should be sequential  oh oh josh  liz taylors assistant called  they wanted the address here to send you something  thats awesome  she must have seen my impression of her

totally serious i mean wouldnt you guys  jack asked me how old i am  what did you say   ahem  jenna relax  i cannot and will not relax liz i am an actress  and when someone asks an actress how old she

me    a closet   of clothes   lemon what tragedy happened in your life that you insist upon punishing yourself  with all this mediocrity  what cause im eating a turkey sub  your turkey sub your clothes  the fact that a woman of your resources and position lives like some boxcar hobo  or maybe its the fact that while im saying all this  you have a piece of lettuce stuck in your hair  this is the unlisted number of stone  the most exclusive restaurant in the city currently  i think its time that you start enjoying some of the finer things in life  completely unsolicited and inappropriate  i will only accept it because i love food  do you know why jack welch is the greatest leader since the pharaohs  because he didnt only involve himself in our work lives but our personal lives as well  he introduced us to the finest booze the most restrictive country clubs  he gave us the names of the most discreet private investigators to spy on our exwives  he held our hands during our triumphs and our senate hearings  i want to hold your hand lemon  yikes  this is a perfect example  you have a milliondollar view yet you refuse to acknowledge  that theres a whole world out there  oh my  there appears to be a gentleman making passionate angry love to himself  yeah i know  thats why i closed the blinds in the first place  right in his office  huh  lemon i like to think of myself as a winner i like to surround myself with winners  i see potential in you  let me be your jack welch  let me be your mentor  no thank you  that is unfortunate  youve  uh  got to admire his persistence and stamina though  am i wrong or is he in the middle of a staff meeting  maybe you should be his mentor  obviously he doesnt need one hes got it all figured out  i got one for ya  see the old guy over there with the girl  mistress or daughter  oh my god i hope its his daughter  yeah me too  oh my god oh  god i hope its his mistress  oh that is just wrong  hey 007 how about some more rolls over here

right  about that place  we actually saw a whole nest of rats when we were leaving  no we didnt  i just didnt want to tell you cause i knew youd freak out  actually i think i saw a rat king  arent rat kings a myth  whats a rat king  oh its when a bunch of rats are crammed into a tiny space  and their tails get all tangled up and they cant even pull apart  and  then it gets awesome  eventually their bodies fuse together and they form a multiheaded live rat king  and we saw one  gosh i hope you got a picture of that with the camera on your beeper  actually my beeper doesnt have a camera but it does have a pedometer  actually not this one  whispering i love him  listen i need to talk to you in my office please   why  now  whats up  is that a tattoo  uhhuh chuckles  who normal now you hear me

common  you are relentless  look uh howard youre obviously an attractive and confident guy  and at a different time in my life i could definitely see the two of us together  im married with two beautiful kids and a pool  jack liz i wasnt trying to set you up  i wanted to show you my handiwork  i used to mentor howard  howard i was a lot like you  i dressed poorly had bad posture  walked

the sandwich place  no sadly i dont think we are  okay i admit it  dennis isnt a sandwich i want to eat every day for the rest of my life  im clueless about men  im clueless about everything that isnt

thats her again isnt it  hi howard hangs up phone  lemon today is the first day of the rest of your life  and what is the first thing you need to do  i have to break up with dennis  and why is that  because he wears shirts with the looney tunes embroidered on them  because he cuts his own hair  because that one little nice thing that he does doesnt make up for the fact  that i dont want to be seen with him in public  and if you dont break up with him now  hell just keep showing up at work to sell beepers  hell just keep calling my mother to borrow money  well just get more and more tangled up in each others lives  until i just cant even get away and were just like oh my god  thats right hes the rat king  and theres only one way to break up with a rat  you have to cut him off completely
