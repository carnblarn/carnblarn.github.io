sheinhardtuniversal did some focus testing this week   we got 100  youre holding that upsiddown   ohno  yes i was afraid of this  it turns out not having the life rights or any janis joplin songs was a negative for audiences  but what about my duet with jimi hendrickson at woodstocks  were all here at woodstocks  someday there will be a black president  uhjenna sheinhdtniversal does not wanna

what i said  mr donaghyhelp rule breaking  this is sad  lemoncome with me  lemonyou know youre supposed to go home after your pervert seminars  im going i just hate not being here   you have to rehearse  no passive resistance  i learned that from dr king im brave   you sure you miss this  yes  as crazy and stressful as this place is not being here is worse  i feel for you  remember that time i came back from the world economic forum with mono  and missed a week of work and i wanted to pull my hair out but i couldnt because its too thick  people like us we need the stress  were only happy when were overcoming obstacles  you take that away we start bouncing off the walls spend our days jabbering at doormen  heyi brighten their day  before i gocan i at least find out what franks hat says   constant cving  he could do better  has anyone looked at this sexual harassment stuff they gave us  i dont need to read it  the whole thing is loosely based on a evening i spent with isiah thomas  no wonder liz got busted  according to this you cant do anything without it being considered harassment  did you know you have to report inoffice relationships   is that true  its the first thing listed  have you read this  welli wanted to because its full of rules  but msvieira made me throw it away  and said pretty boys like me shouldnt be filling their heads with ideas   hifrank  hello  coworker  msvieira  of course my job is annoying but that doesnt mean i dont love it  im sure your job can be annoying  not all the tenants are as fun as me  i get it  heywould you mind if brought a
