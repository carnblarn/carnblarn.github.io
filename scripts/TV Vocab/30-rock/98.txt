                we need to talk  right now  we know tracy is not in africa hes hiding somewhere in new york   what  dont play stupid walter  we have ways of making people talk  by giving them fresh apple slices  listen to me very carefully  this show is my life  i need tracy back  where is he  you think we dont want him back  do you know how much our cobra payments are  and hes the only one that knows the combination  to the candy safe  the worst part is being able to see the candy  all right  but if i find out youre holding out on me  i will no longer allow you  to use my office for your history club  thats ironic because next weeks topic is fascism   what about grizz and dot com  they dont know anything  neither does anyone tracys close to  his wife charles barkley edward james almost  who is an edward james olmos lookalike   that tracy is friends with  kenneth talks to tracy  on skype doesnt he just call him  it doesnt work that way  tracy only contacts kenneth on special occasions  like bastille day  im going to go ahead and assume  that bastille is a stripper  as well you should  now theres a chance he may call tomorrow  because its his lizards birthday  has it really been a year since we were all at the waldorf  eating that cake made out of lizard meal  yup jeremys almost 11  for now our only lead is the pizza box  that we saw tracy eating from  we traced the phone number to a pizzeria in queens  listen to me i sound like cagney and lacey  but without the slutty clothes  you have to find him lemon  your show works with tracy  and this morning i figured out how to fix nbc  we will only do shows that work  thats nonsense  do you know what the business model is  in the entertainment industry  make ten shows and hope that one of them works  we produce more failed pilots  than the french air force  15 million so far developing a show  called who nose about an investigative reporter  who cant smell and has to get the story using only his eyes  ears and other senses  you underestimated me congressman  because i cant smell  but you made one mistake  you let me see the documents  so from now on no more throwing good money after bad  only what works 10 million developing dad 20  not on my watch  your father may be gone  but before he died  he programmed me to take his place  no shut it down  this is terrible  so whats going on  is tracy coming

taxpayer money  saying theres a veterinarian running around connecticut  trying to make a house out of breasts  for the governor to live in  but theres a positive message at the end of it  if youre a

that name  it was a romantic comedy  with reese witherspoon and patrick dempsey  reese witherspoons just a likeable version of me  then she dropped out and it was rewritten as a buddy comedy  with dempsey and josh hartnett  but everyone fell asleep during the table read  so we moved it over to telemundo  where they tried to turn it into a variety show  hosted by a supermodel and a soccer ball with a mustache  i met that soccer ball once at a nohandsallowed sex party  then after another round of rewrites  it was picked up by our lowbudget thriller  highbudget porno division splatterflix  and now its a horror movie starring any blonde actress  thank you  wait thats our project  this is exactly what i was talking to lemon about  three years millions on rewrites  20000 in firstclass flights for the drill  and we still have nothing to show for it  and we never will  we just got shut down  because connecticuts being a douche bag  they wont give us a tax break  unless the movie
