you  oh i had to rehire that liz lemler that you fired  okay  and i didnt want any more trouble with her so i had to give her a promotion too  fantastic  its an amazing opportunity for her out at uh corporate headquarters  in connecticut  shes transferred to connecticut  yes  thats right  it seems that things are lining up once again for old liz lemon  and you say  thank you jack  youre welcome  i hear your girlfriend got transferred  sorry  yeah  i guess it wasnt meant to be  liz  you forgot to give me the key to your place  and i need it my wife knows about our little secret  i dont know how she found out  oh god  i shouldve just gotten a vasectomy  let me explain  hey did you hear the good news j d  im iriscatholic now  like you regis and the pope  oh no youre not  the church already has enough lawsuits  see i could screw up now and then just go to confession  no longer do i have to throw my parties in international waters  thats not how it works tracy  even though there is the whole confession thing thats no free pass  because there is a crushing guilt that comes with being a catholic  whether things are good or bad or youre simply eating tacos in the park  there is always the crushing guilt  i dont think i want that  im out  somehow i feel oddly guilty about that  i dont want nothing crushing me
