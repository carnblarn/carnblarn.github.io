                1 liz liz lemon  its me thad from college  ive had my skin tags removed  since then so you can see my eyes now  oh you ran the light board at the theater  everyone called you thad no nickname  and you you were the star the sound of music  thank you no everyone thinks of the young nazi boy  as the star of that show  you are one age going on another age   whats going to happen next  a lot of people didnt realize that was  the free unlicensed version  look i know its last minute but im having  an epic leap day party this afternoon  wow a daytime party celebrating leap day  sounds fun but i have to work  hey liz new bluetooth  no im talking to someone  oh im sorry  i dont see people that look like that  sorry  wow that was this creep i went to college with  such a nerd  and this is coming from someone who wrote lyrics  to the song the cantina band playsin star wars  figrin dan the kloo horn man   hes from clakdor seven  but at least i dont throw leap day parties  wait that was thad warmald the billionaire  no that was sad thad the skintag lad  chuckles i coined that  that name has been all over  the gold digger message boards lately  i dont know a lot about business  but he did an internet and now the computers like him  and wall street is google  oh my god  we are going to this party and youre introducing me to thad  liz im on a sexual walkabout right now  i need to know if anything can  make me happier than being with paul  and maybe 20 billion would do it  what how much internet did he do  poke your eye pull your hair you forgot what clothes to wear  what the hell  youre not wearing yellow and blue on leap day  so what leap day is not a thing  leap day william  leap day william  bursting from the sea  will he bring his bucket of sweets for mom and pop and me   what the crap is going on in here  why leap day william is visiting  leap day william  miss lemon did you not grow up  with leap day william  he lives in the mariana trench  he emerges every four years  to trade childrens tears for candy  what no  but white haven was founded by the amish  and we really only celebrated their holidays  after high school i went on rumspringa  it was crazy  i totally snuck into the witches of eastwick  but where were you when we did this four years ago  certainly not at a michaels crafts crafting cruise  oh miss lemon you are missing out  every four years you get a magical extra day  a day to do the things you ordinarily wouldnt do  to take chances  for instance i am wearing  a braided necklace with a sharks tooth on it  i listened to rap music for the first time  not a fan  and you and i are going to a party  thrown by a billionaire  come on take a leap liz  okay fine ill go but if he has a giant chandelier  in his house im out  those things fall  waah waah  all pretend to cry  leap day william leap day william   exciting jazz music    s06 ep09  leap day   knock on door  happy leap day lemon   help yourself to some rhubarb  rhubarb  is white haven the only city in america  that doesnt celebrate leap day  oh its not such a big deal in boston either  just a leap day william parade citywide ice maze  and uh we dont poke you
