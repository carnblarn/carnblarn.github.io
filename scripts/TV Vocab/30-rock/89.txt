a doozy  my aunt linda is bringing her new boyfriend  who is neither her age nor her race  and her exhusband will also be there  with his date alcoholism  i swoop in the next day for presents and pie  well if youre around come by for dinner  colleen will be up from florida  and um shed love to see you  because my youthful energy makes her feel young  no because she views you as a peer  she can complain with about how no one  wears pantyhose any longer  ah how are we supposed to conceal our spider veins  barelegged at christmas  okay guys this kabletown promo is the last thing we have to do  before the holiday break  liz lemon i cannot participate in this promo  why  because its not honest  as an actor  it is my job to tell the truth  hold the mirror to humanity  and sell proactiv  i will not spout your lies liz lemon  and i will not say merry christmas from kabletown  ever since tracy got nominated for a golden globe  he thinks hes sean penn  well they have both had screaming fights  with wyclef jean  well just do this without him merry christmas jenna  you can say both lines  crying merry christmas from kabletown  and all of us at tgs  i think we got it  sobbing  wait are are you

card did we end up sending out  oh  happy holidays  is what terrorists say  merry christmas avery and jack  knock at door  oh its just liz  why do people always say that  avery is keeping her pregnancy a secret at work  so shes been carrying around large objects  whenever shes in the building  i was wondering what was up with your show last night  the market rallying today  despite a pullback in gold stocks  anyway i was gonna bring dessert tomorrow  so are there any foods that are making you nauseous lately  please dont say a half sleeve of oreos  oh im not gonna be there  im leaving tonight to spend christmas with my family  really  thats why i like dating older men  their parents are usually dead or senile  so theres never an argument about the holidays  why arent you and colleen going with her  oh you know uh colleen is frail  and avery is in her third trimester  gasps you havent told colleen  about the baby yet what  i have been watching the mentalist a lot lately  because my tvs on cbs and i lost my remote  i think ive become a bodylanguage expert  for instance i can now tell  that jack wants to kill the person to his right  why havent you told her  i just havent found the right time   shrilly that is no excuse  shrilly this is so bad  i cannot have the two of you on the same side of an argument  we donaghys believe that when theres something  at all delicate to talk about  it is best to suppress it  until it erupts into a fistfight at a church barbecue  i understand all that jack  the symbol on the jessup family crest  is a knight refusing to talk about his feelings  but this baby is not bad news  you dont know colleen were not married avery  why should that matter i mean she did the same thing  i mean what did colleen say when you told her  you knew about your real dad  gasps you never told her about milton either  i am the mentaliz  you have so many secrets that was over a year ago   how do you not get hives  how could you not tell her  for the love of god  sir this came for you  thanks klmnop  ive been waiting for this  oh i didnt know you made  another chunks movie mr jordan  that first one was a classic  dearly beloved we are gathered here  to celebrate the life of althea chunk  farts damn thats funky  obesity is killing the africanamerican community  with laughter  yeah well this sequel is never coming out  i bought the rights so this movie wont be released  why wouldnt you want people to see your movie  it looks so funny  thats the problem ken  its 67 minutes of me acting like a hilarious fool  if this movie comes out before the golden globes  itll ruin my new image  mr jordan i thought you loved acting like a fool  no i dont  im lying  my favorite thing in the world is making people laugh  but i cant now  i had to go on charlie rose kenneth  charlie rose   oh thats horrible  i have no choice  i got to stay serious  from now on the only movies tracy jordan makes  are about the holocaust georgia okeeffe or both  i didnt care much for the gazpacho soup  i mean wheres the fun of sending it back  because it isnt hot  mother  yes  avery and i are having a baby  i see  may i remind you this is good news  this is a disgrace  what are my chums at the death shore retirement community  gonna say  when i tell them that my unmarried son  has knocked up a protestant  oh i knew you would do this  take a happy moment and ruin it  just like you did when i won that scholarship  at my highschool graduation  it should have gone to the other boy  this is the reason i waited seven months to tell you  you kept this from your own mother  oh oh colleen dont talk to me about secrets  i know some things youve done that you would not want me  to bring up right now  most people thought i was a hero  for killing lydias parrot  im going upstairs now  and think about more comments  for tomorrow  this isnt over  line ringing  jack  guess what they just got caller id in vermont  milton i hope you dont have plans for tomorrow  im having a little christmas dinner  and i want you to be my guest of honor  well it is a little sudden  but yes id love to come to your holiday dinner  christmas its christmas dinner  holiday music  hey rick can you cover section three for me  im in the weeds oh liz  oh im sorry i thought you were a transvestite  paul i need to talk to you about jenna  oh how is she  honestly i dont think ive seen her this upset  since hurricane katrina  the coverage preempted a tampon commercial she was in   oh  and she keeps trying  to pretend its just about some new years party  but i think she misses you  look ii miss her too but its over between us now  ii dont even think about jenna anymore  i dont think about kissing her or laughing with her  or photographing her with just salamanders  covering her nipples  when its not meant to be its not meant to be  you cant be on the floor  without your roller skates rick  im not rick  merry christmas jack  sorry i finished the oreos in the cab  im glad you could make it lemon  welcome to my christmas attack zone  your what what does that mean  professor milton greene  is on his way here from penn station  milton your father is coming here  please tell me that colleen  has no idea  the father that she hid from me for 50 years  the man that she doesnt even know  i know exists is joining us for supper  uh red or white  white jack what are you doing  you promised me a dramafree dinner  i could be sitting at the corner table  at the kmart cafe right now  doorbell buzzes oh that must be dad  wait does milton know that colleen is here  no i want it all to be fresh  will he erupt with anger over her years of secrecy  who knows miltons a hippie pacifist  but i once saw colleen provoke a buddhist monk  into whipping a battery at her  my boy  oh jack this is going to be  the best winters eve light festival ever  liz  ana happy whatever you believe in too  no i am not letting this happen  milton jack has an ulterior motive for bringing you here  yes its true  youre going to be a grandfather  oh what a blessing oh life is beautiful  joy beautiful spark of the gods  daughter of elysium  and liz youre already showing  no its not me a that is not what he has to tell you  colleen is here  and jack is using you to ambush her   why would you do that  ill tell you why  because when my mother found out about your granddaughter  its a girl shell be intuitive  colleen did not see it as a blessing  she saw it as an embarrassment  because my girlfriend avery and i are not married  an embarrassment she has no right to judge you  she needs to read my new book  theres no wrong way to make a family  thats for you  i agree with you milton but colleen disapproves  well thats awfully hypocritical for a woman  who kept her son a secret  from his own father  im gonna give her a piece of my mind tonight  oh great averys here and she looks mad  jack i got your message  how dare colleen disapprove of me  of us oh sweetheart im sorry  i didnt mean for my message to make you angry  and have you come all the way back here  now there are three people here that are mad at colleen  wait this is avery  how could that woman not adore  such a beautiful daughterinlaw   oh  by the way we have  a tradition in my family  where we let the child name itself  oh yeah thats hippie nonsense  absolutely not  well suit yourself but my son spiderman  turned out just fine  okay this is disgusting  it is christmas you are not going to ambush  an old woman for the mistakes that she has made  i mean who hasnt made mistakes  i once frenchkissed a dog at a party  to try to impress what turned out to be  a very tall 12yearold  lemon we all know what mistakes are  im going to tell colleen whats happening  while you all calm down  wheres her room  whispering dont worry i sent her to the east wing  its very confusing it was designed by mc escher  these stairs are weird  mother  dinner is ready  what are you doing here sir  i wasnt setting this up because im spending christmas at work  i certainly wasnt going to pretend those trash cans  were my parents  im here picking up a serious outfit  from wardrobe for my event later  all the big actors do charity work on christmas eve  russell crowe is having an auction  to benefit the victims of his own mood swings  so what are you doing sir  screening my very sad movie hard to watch  at a womens shelter  its gonna be real depressing  i hate seeing you like this sir  and you ruined ludachristmas  in the darfur region the dead may be the lucky ones  next slide  what else can i do kenneth  people only take you seriously if youre serious  but comedy is just as important as drama  people need to laugh  especially in these tough times  and after all isnt laughter the best medicine  except for insulin spironolactone and bupropion  which i have for you whenever youre ready sir   mother you look lovely  i see you brought the bag  that my bastard grandchild will come in  merry christmas mrs donaghy  my gift to you is the feeling of superiority youll have  for the next two seconds is she drunk jack  because you know when youre pregnant  one bottle of wine a day and thats it  mother you must remember milton greene  my father and your shameful sex secret  why would you bring him here  oh i see  trying to make me look like the bad guy is that it  you are the bad guy  you kept me from my son for 50 years  you didnt miss much  hes a good boy he got me a kidney  from elvis costello  all that time lost because of you and your pride  and think of what ive lost  going on fatherandson habitat for humanity builds  and road trips in my vw van  yeah or other things  and then you dare to judge us and our life decisions  who do you think you are  god this house is enormous  oh hi colleen i tried to stop this  well mother what do you have to say for yourself  its speechless  merry christmas merry christmas one and all  gasps  cell phone vibrating  jenna this dinner is a disaster  my life is ruined  i just came up with the perfect couples costume  for new queers eve  and i cant use it because of stupid paul  you know what  the reason im not with my family right now  is because i didnt want any drama  and thats all im getting  first from these jagwagons and now you  paul is the reason youre upset  its not about this party its about the party  i want to eat shrimp off an old gay  dressed as baby new year  ugh cell phone beeps  hi colleen   hmm  are you all right  just thinking about my next move  no no what next move  this thing hasnt even started  welcome to my christmas attack zone  ladies of the battered womens shelter  please be quiet a man is talking  youre about to watch a film that holds a mirror  up to your own terrible lives  youre gonna see poverty drug abuse  and a bunch of babies having a hammer fight in a dumpster  comedy is just as important portantportant  laughter is the best medicine

heart attack  yes i do believe a heart is required  that is enough jack  what happened tonight was so scary  and the reason that it happened  is that we were not being honest with each other  so from
