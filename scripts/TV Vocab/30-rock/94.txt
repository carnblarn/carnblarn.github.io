                1 listen up everyone  i have an announcement to make  as you may have heard  carol and i broke up last week  hang on why do you have a cat  and a fanny pack  and your ponytail  its being held up by a chip clip  because im giving up jenna  i did the math  how many times does a woman meet mr right  ive had three chances  floyd then carol  and i was once in an elevator with tom brokaw  and i blew all three  opportunities  so i am making my graceful transition  into spinsterhood  i have adopted this cat  named her emily dickinson  oh come on  named her emily dickinson  lemon a word  hang on  recent breakup fanny pack cat  quick who is the lead character on ncis  special agent jethro gibbs  in your office now  whats the point jack im done  i took the money i was saving for my honeymoon  and i bought a cemetery plot  i also joined a book club  at the senior center near my home  were reading murder on the orient express  you know theres a movie of that right  i did not  i want to help you lemon  but this is not the week  averys maternity leave was cut short  so she could go cover the collapse  of greeces banking system  since inventing democracy  those guys have been coasting  so youre all alone with baby liz  were calling her liddy after liddy dole  g gordon liddy  and my martial arts instructor li di  in addition i have a huge presentation coming up  meeting magazine is already calling it  the first great meeting of the decade  i have to be at my best  im negotiating nbcs licensing fees with kabletown  but arent nbc and kabletown the same company now  that seems like a pretty big conflict of interest  why would the government even allow that merger  its okay dont worry  you just keep watching bridalplasty  alysinna died last week  oh damn it i didnt leave  my baby nurse her check this morning  i have to go back home and pay her   right now  its complicated  these women run your household  so you have to keep them happy  which means not saying anything  as your dvr fills up with trinidadian soap operas  but as soon as im out of the woods lemon  ill take care of this latest dysfunction  theres nothing to take care of jack  watch this  i can fit emily dickinsons whole head in my mouth  no   oh hey pete whats up  well nobody told the musical guest  that tracys in africa  so all their instruments got delivered  even though theres no show  rock stars man  people screaming your name  hot women throwing themselves at you  living on a bus  ha  i had all that once  for three months back in the early 80s  really what band were you in  everybodys workin for the weekend   what  yep i was in loverboy  but then i had to choose  between staying in the band  or taking that college scholarship  to study tv budgeting   mmm  i made my choice  that part of my life is over  hey its never too late  what did you just say  its never too late   its never too late for now   yesterdays dreams are gone   but today im singin this song   cause its never too late   its never too late for now   we need to start a band  i think we just did  im sorry you had to wait for this sherry  i hope there was enough shark meat  in the refrigerator for one of your sandwiches  hold on this is the same amount  i was paying you when you worked full time  and now youre just working nights  its my hourly rate  you understand my confusion  im actually paying you more money  to be here half the time  im not saying that what you do isnt important  avery and i appreciate you  and liddy just adores you  but lets just say youre at the market  buying potatoes  and that tenpound bag of potatoes costs  400  but then the uh grocery concierge  tells you that a fivepound bag of potatoes  costs 400  well that would be shocking right  because a fivepound bag should only cost 200  what im saying is that we value what you do  but this rate is uh unreasonable  so what you wan do  i want to resolve this fairly and amicably  and i dont want any bad blood so  it was nice negotiating with you  and uh here is all of your money  an impulsive murderer  has been murdered  but in which of the two ways  that i have suggested  in the simpler way by the mafioso  disguised as a wagonlit conductor  or in the more complex way  liz enough  i am not gonna just sit and watch you  plummet into spinsterhood  why are you talking so fast  because im upset  also ive been taking  these new czechoslovakian organslimming pills  they contain a little bit of meth  which is something my body needs anyway  listen im not gonna let you wallow like this  i am taking you out so you can reboundsexually  what no  now when im rebounding  i like to do it with an nba player  because its fun wordplay and theyre mean  well thank you for that disgusting offer  but i will be in editing all night  putting together the best of tracy jordan  to replace this weeks show  so cant go out too bad  well im not giving up  i didnt give up when eric roberts  abandoned me in the desert and i wont now  no judgment liz  mr roberts thought i was dead  oh  its never too late for now   two three  its never too late    there you are  great  you just ruined a really boss take  were recording a song called  its never too late for now  its about that delicious little mystery i call life  oh my god that sucks  come on we gotta go to editing  no im not going to editing  im in here shredding away like a righteous ax master  and my arthritis is acting up  do you have any ibuprofen  uh my fanny pack is in my office  in my minifridge  i like my tampons to be cold  ill be downstairs  wait hornbergerrossitano  why is your name first  its alphabetical so what  so im the one who said  its never too late  i invented that  when we get up at the grammys i talk  not you  welcome to brokeblack mountain  you need to go black marty  this is loz liz this is liz  lemon i am supposed to represent nbc  in a negotiation that rex belcher  the american journal of meetings rated four chairs  four  im sorry is that another magazine about meetings  meanwhile i just got worked over  by my trinidadian night nurse  i made every mistake you can in a negotiation  i spoke first i smiled  i negotiated with myself  if i had done that during a mock negotiation  in business school  professor widmer would have spanked me  in front of the whole class bare bottom  okay but its harder with someone like a nanny right  theres an emotional component  she takes care of your baby  lemon you just had a structural analytic insight  professor widmer would have given you  a good job spanking  what is business school  the reason sherry can manipulate me  is because she has leverage  eight pounds of screaming  toothless softskulled leverage  liddy loves sherry  and sherry assumes that i love liddy  but you do right  yes but sherry cant prove that i love liddy  so i renegotiate under new conditions  specifically that i hate my newborn daughter  wow jack i could never pretend  to hate my beautiful baby daughter  emily dickinson the cat  oh boy  uhoh i dont feel so good  i think maybe i have food poisoning  really cause ive never had a problem  ordering from american sub restaurant very clean come in  im sorry could you just um leave your notes  ill come in early tomorrow to finish  i guess this means youre free tonight after all  where did you come from  its a trick i developed  to catch people talking about me behind my back  did you know everyone thinks im insane  now you have no excuse to stay in  aw come on no  jenna you know how much i hate clubs  and dance halls and odeons  theyre all malarkey  okay what if i promise to find a place you like  and if i dont like it i can leave  yes if you dont like it you can leave  this isnt eric roberts tepee  ah sherry  excellent  ive been thinking about our conversation earlier  it occurs to me that you are laboring  under a fatal misapprehension  you think you have leverage over me  but you dont  i dont care about the baby  ive only known her for a few weeks  and other than a fondness for averys breasts  liddy and i have nothing in common  she is one of two people  ever to have thrown up on me  and i havent spoken to joe namath  since that mardi gras  whats more i dont think liddy looks like me  so evolutionarily that makes me want to eat her  in other words either you take a pay cut  or go and look for another job  who has the leverage now sherry  your move  please stay  ill send everyone in your family to college  mmhmm  so soft music  ample seating  and i know how much you like clearly marked fire exits  dont worry  ill find something to hate  oh okay here we go this sucks  this place is called canal yards project  what does that mean  i dont know  it used to be a factory or something  nope hipster nonsense  im out  no you are not leaving because of the name  excuse me can i order  two diet cranberry beach bangs please  you got it im gonna need to see your id miss  how about this for id  i participated in hands across america  nerds where is it  okay my license is missing  which is my cue to go home  excuse me is this yours  oh yeah thanks  i recognized your hair from across the room  what is that is that chestnut  oh the color is actually called  grandfathers shoe  uh can i get you a drink  im having white wine with ice cubes and sprite  thats my drink  i keep a thermos of it by my toilet  you misheard me  okay uh excuse me  can i get two more of these please  so did they make your droids wait outside too  seriously why cant droids go into the cantina  i mean ponda baba can try to shoot luke  but a protocol droid is somehow a problem  castles fall into the sand   could this really be gods plan   or is it never too late   its never too late for now   why cant i hear my vocals  i just mixed them down a little  i think it sounds better  oh really  do you think that or does she  this has nothing to do with yuki  this is about making my song  your song  all right you know what forget it  sound mound is finished  which means i now have  pete like 20 of these just came in for you  damn it  im having a really nice time with you liz  me too anders  i like how you dont have one weird little tooth  thank you  look i was gonna go back to my hotel room  get eat pray love on spectravision  and make fun of it  ew julia roberts in a movie about eating  give me kirstie alley  somebody who knows what shes doing  come on  lets go  oh boy that does sound fun but  i really shouldnt  i came here with my friend  so im just gonna stay here  get off me my eye  its a fight  typical nightclub malarkey  whoa  you okay  my hearts pounding like im watching  oprahs farewell season  i thought the stupid universe was telling me  to get a cat and be a spinster  and now i dont know  whats it trying to tell me with you  liz look  i dont believe in signs or messages from the universe  you know what i do believe  its never too late for now  its never its never   its never its never   its never too late   its never too late for now   every day we give you 100  for cat  home  do you realize what youre doing to me sherry  youre unraveling the very fabric of who i am  i negotiate for a living and i never lose  and now i have to go negotiate  with my colleagues at kabletown  after having been reamed by a woman  wearing winnie the pooh hospital pants  i dont have what you have sherry  a brandnew baby that theyve poured  time and money and love into  some helpless pathetic useless thing  that would die if left alo  oh god i do have that  i have nbc  look broadcast networks receiving licensing fees  is unprecedented jack  but were willing to offer nbc   i mean okay uh not to negotiate against myself  but i get where you guys are coming from  mmhmm  look nbc is part of the kabletown family now  its our baby and we want it to thrive  but your offer is its unreasonable  so what you wanna do  oh way to go liz  attagirl walk of shame  you bowlegged bitch  ah i see you opened the scotch nbc sent us  that week we came in third  im guessing your meeting went well  homerun lemon  and uh speaking of baseball metaphors  i see that someone got to first base  which is what i consider sex with a stranger  okay fine i had a onenight stand  and it was not the worst  and maybe youre right  i shouldnt give up just yet  mm  still i cant believe i did that  and i wouldnt have  if everything hadnt gone so perfectly  i mean what if i had been stuck in the edit room all night  or if i hated the club and left  or what if anders  yeah anders hadnt found my license  dont overthink it lemon  stranger things happen every day  i once saw an internet video  of a mouse and a bird that are friends  dont overthink it  ah  gasp  last night a repulsive act occurred at a hotel in midtown  there are two possible explanations  as to how this event came to be  a simple one and a complex one  the simple explanation is that i went to a discotheque  and a handsome interesting man fell for me  in the wake of my breakup i allowed myself  to have an experience that gave me reason  to be hopeful about the future again  very simple  great i think were done here  please monsieur  there remains of course the complex explanation  a vast conspiracy involving multiple agents  and precise coordinated efforts  a conspiracy that begins with the timely food poisoning  of donna straunk  and who here has access to donnas food  the second peculiar event i lose my license  allowing it to be found by a handsome stranger  serendipity perhaps  but how does one lose ones license  out of a malfunctionproof velcro phillies sport wallet  someone must have had access to my fanny pack  i only wanted ibuprofen  then why is my ibuprofen bottle still sealed  ah  and then there is the matter of the wine  four glasses and yet i was wide awake  was my uncharacteristic energy  perhaps due to the giddiness of the evening  or was someone slipping me  black market organslimming pills  liz i wouldnt  the conspiracy continues  what pushed me out of the club  when i was wavering about leaving with anders  yeah i came here with my friend  so im just gonna stay here  aah  yah  get off of me my eye  what this  i got hit by a bird on a roller coaster  even the club was strange  almost as if it had been designed specifically for me  but who has the resources and the connections  to create a liz lemonthemed club in one day  you had to sign your crime didnt you  youre the one who gave me those modvds  and what was the final straw  it was anders saying  its never too late for now  a coincidence that i took as a sign from the universe  also its just a great song  that pete wrote  thanks man  sound mound rocks the town  shut up both of you  so how did anders even know that phrase  how did anders seem to know everything about me  its white wine ice cubes and sprite  she calls it  funky juice  i dont know if i want to do this  theres only one question i cant answer  who was anders  an old harvard chum of toofers  the son of one of jacks senator friends  he certainly wasnt a swiss prostitute  that martha stewart recommended to me  and that is the complex explanation  of course such a conspiracy would require a group of people  who knew me so well and cared about my happiness so much  that its impossible to believe  no one could ever be that lucky  which is why i choose the simple explanation  i choose to believe that last night  liz lemon went out got some  and felt good about it  and so i say goodbye to spinsterhood  goodbye to giving up and to  oh god a hawk got her  emily dickinson  cause shes a weekend lady   shes got that weekend style     temperatures risin   shes gonna make you smile   monday tuesday wednesday unh unh unh          weekend woman
