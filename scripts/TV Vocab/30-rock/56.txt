down there  and a guy like paul who can drive at night  you just dont say no to that  well i apologize then  i thought we were going to get through this together  i guess your coping mechanism  is to bring a married man back to your hotel room  coping  what am i supposed to be coping with  its the 35th anniversary of dad leaving  which time jack  that man left and came back so many times  that i totally lost count  one night he went out to move the car  and he was gone  from the spring of 57 until  one night he just showed up out of the blue  put your shoes on collie  were goin to see some like it hot  you honestly dont remember when he left for good  because i sure as hell do  oh my god is that what this is all about  is that what youve been holding onto all these years  jack stop wasting your time thinking about that man  youre nothing like him you know  no way you ever could be   what does that mean  i dont know  im old jack you know  and i dont know what im thinking about half the time  i do know this  youre my good boy  voice breaking i just love ya to death  thank you mother and i love you too  paul  youre on your own tonight  i have a date with my son  hes taking me

cant take it anymore  i hate it  one of those strippers took of lutzs shirt  that gland thing is no joke  everything is upside down  we need to go back to the way things were  with both of us getting preferential treatment  yes we upset the natural order  youre going to strip clubs im up writing all night  look whos a sailor  were dressing monkeys up as people  and monkeys are playing with people as toys  its not a toy tracy  little jenna thinks that this is her baby  screeching   oh no  you said you loved me  your foot fingers are so strong  we dont wanna end up like those two  youre so right jenna laughing  were okay  hes just expressing himself  monkey chittering  hey before you hear crazy rumors and start believing them  the gibbon did not attack jenna  he was trying to mate with her face   what  nothing everyones fine  hey some like it hot i love this movie  my mother told me she and my dad  went to see it together  and if thats the stuff she remembers  maybe thats how i should remember him too  on a date with my mom instead of walking out the door  been fun to write back then  you could get away with crazy plot twists  because audiences were so much less sophisticated  wait a minute  this movie came out in 1959  how could my father have been gone  from the spring of 57 until 1959  if i was conceived in 58  jimmy donaghys not my father  gasps twist
