hurts  ok i love a good joke but i am their boss  and at a certain point it crosses a line  to quote rodney dangerfield hey i  hey i no lets see lemon if youre about to say  that you dont get any respect youre right  i mean in a postapocalyptic world  how would society even use you  traveling bard  radiation canary i have to run lemon  i have an appointment in washington  the hearings on the kabletownnbc deal are underway  and the company has entrusted me to be their front man  hey will you ask congress where they put the usa network  ive been trying to find monk for like three months  the only thing i will be discussing  with the house subcommittee on baseball quiz shows  terrorism and media is vertical integration  whats vertical integration  imagine that your favorite corn chip manufacturer  also owned the number one diarrhea medication  thatd be great cause then they could put  a little sample of the medicine in each bag  keep thinking  except then they might be tempted to make the corn chips  give you vertical integration  wow that should not be allowed to happen  but its my job to make sure that it does happen  do you know who gets elected to congress these days  former athletes washedup actors and women  im locked and loaded and ready for whatever  these beltway lobotomites throw at me  what if we have to stay overnight  and there arent enough rooms so we have to share a room  and i forgot to bring a shirt to sleep in  and the stores are all closed exciting jazz music   liz quick question about the johnny appleseed sketch  does it hurt it if we cant call him johnny appleseed  yes why  well johnny appleseed was a real guy  and his descendants are very litigious  so here is a list of the names that legal says we can use  jerry bananaseed and nothing else  great so what are my choices  either i argue with legal  or i spend all day writing something else  does anyone care how hard i work text message beeps  oh we cant use jerry bananaseed  someone with that name killed a bunch of nurses in portland  sighs  kenneth youre back  i need you to get me something called vagitrax  its for dry knees  i wish i were back miss maroney  im reapplying to the page program  but its a lot harder than my first time around  its gotten really competitive  you shoulda seen what i saw in mr winerslavs office  well your interview will be thursday  is there any av equipment youll be needing   equipment  inside schwartz 21   hill street blues wings is fun   golden girls quantum leap   outsourced is the new friends   the process used to be dignified  now its just a pageant  just a pageant  thats like saying a guy is cool because he has just a speedboat  if you need help winning a pageant  youve come to the right place  well if itll get me back into the page program  when i was pageantizing my mother told me  theres only three things standing between you and winning  your breasts and wanting it bad enough  im not sure that applies weve already started  and this deal will count as a 39 bump  variable against an 11 increase of synchronized flexibility  sir my name is rob reiner  and before i became a congressman i dabbled in television  won a couple of emmys  and i believe that my experience out there  in hollyweird gives me a special insight  into these types of deals  particularly when it comes to say it meathead  vertical integration  ahh the dreaded vi  bad for america kills innovation drives up prices  is that it  i guess thats why big oil and microsoft  are such great american failures   what  dare i say vertical integration drives down prices  by streamlining the process  consider the farmer  he owns his land the equipment he uses to harvest his crops  the truck that he uses to drive that product  to the farmers market where he sells it  directly to the consumer  is that not vertical integration   mark the time ladies and gentlemen that congress put a bullet  in the head of the american farmer  no you win  the acclaimed director of when harry met sally  would never do that  as always its been a pleasure  mr donaghy one last question  why is nbc so racist  tap dancing  horrible  what else can you do  oh everybody   born before jesus   is in hell   they went straight  enough  im gonna have to reinvent you  break you down completely and build you up from scratch  just like mickey rourke did me to sexually  but miss maroney i dont want to be reinvented i want to be me  all right first things first  can you lose that goony accent  well i dont know maam  accent getting thicker you made me think about it  and when i get to thinkin bout it it just get worse  mr donaghy i represent  rhode islands first congressional district  its a diverse community from the hardworking moms and dads  of smithfield to those spoiled jags at brown  to a thriving flourishing italian criminal community  in providence  its my responsibility to make sure  that public airwaves represent the face of my public  now one question why is it that nbc looks about as diverse  as a wilco concert  i would point to sunday night football  which features many black players and coaches  oh and we have anthony anderson  the star of law  order which is entering its 21st  whispering its been cancelled  what why did we cancel that  that doesnt make any sense  mr donaghy this may just be about money to you  but as a member of congress and a black woman  i dont really see color or gender mr chang  i feel i have an extra duty not just to my constituents  but to future generations  now unless i see some serious change at nbc  and soon i can guarantee you this deal will not happen  people murmuring  rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb  peas and carrots rhubarb rhubarb  peas and carrots rhubarb  dotcom you run tracys

kabletown hearings  as a soap box from which to complain  about a lack of diversity on tv  well she has a point  i was reading the new malcolm gladwell new yorker piece  on my kindle did you really read that  no i did not  i really resent the congresswomans accusations  ive long been an advocate for diversity  its made this nation great  the chinese built the railroads  the irish built and then filled the jails  a guy named juan built my armoire  diversity means new ideas and new markets  it is our best hope for true innovation  did you tell all that to congresswoman bookman  no i was too busy trying to remember  the name of the black kid on community  dnall glover  it wouldnt have mattered anyway  the whole thing was just political theater  you should have seen her grandstanding  the future and america  now i may have lost my train of thought several minutes ago  but if i continue to talk like this  no one will notice and when i stop  you will applaud my energy thank you  thank you  applause thank you  i cant let bookman jeopardize this deal  tell me about diversity at tgs  well lutz claims to be inuit  at least that was his explanation  when i found his poem about snow

promotion  of some kind sure  make him cohead writer  i always figured hed take over for me when i die at my desk  really youre okay with that  oh yeah let someone else share the total lack of respect  deal with the meetings the complaining  the stupid johnny appleseed sketch  whoa whoa whoa  you are not doing a sketch on the appleseed family  monty appleseed and i share a liquor locker at the opera  screams  hoarsely i forgot my doctor said no more frustrated noises  because it makes my vocal cords go muttering  now its gonna be like this all day  there you are  ive got hair extensions for

can tell that youre off me  mr spurlock do you think the system is broken when it is news  that an africanamerican man  is a head writer for a network tv show  i think i can answer that  another question that we could be asking  is why isnt it a big deal that a woman is a head writer  i would argue that tv is more of a boys club than a white club  i like your dress  do you have to wear a bra with it  i will let you get back to toofer  whos toofer  i dont know  james when people think of tgs  they think of tracy jordan jenna maroney  the mysterious crew deaths the angela lansbury lawsuit

troops and the flagtroops  youre doing it  and i apologize  but i only talk this way so i can get people to listen  i care about these issues  and so do i  if you just give me a chance  instead of ambushing me in front of the congress  and my own employees  you think i dont take diversity seriously  only a fool doesnt  diversity is the engine that drives this country  we are an immigrant nation
