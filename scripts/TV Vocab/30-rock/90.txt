rectified immediately  see this is exactly the kind of thing that happens  when there is no order no planning  hitler and martha stewart would have hated that wedding  of course its everyone elses fault  that the minister thought the lady  in the white dress and the veil was the bride  it was a mens tennis shirt  and a governmentsanctioned head net  you kept holding on to my arm  its hard to

briefly  how do yall make up  ah  look paula and i love each other  but two people living together its unnatural  and while our children  are basically snot silos with bb guns  they do come in handy as a buffer  is that like being a fluffer  because i have done that and did not enjoy it  blowdrying animals at a pet salon is hard work  no a buffer is a protective barrier  like pigs have around their delicious testicle meat  we cant fight around the kids  you see them looking up at you with their little faces  their hair already receding  and you bite your tongue  a buffer  what is it  thanks jack for coming to this emergency meeting  im sorry im four hours late  but my alarm clock didnt go off  because it died in a cockfight last night  tracy what can i do for you  well its come to my attention that im going to die  oh please you have nothing to worry about  we have martin lawrence on a holding deal  look i dont want anything to happen to my husband  but if it did we have a lot of expenses  estate planning is complicated  what with the government taking half  what  thats double taxation  i like you angie  how can i help  well to maintain our standard of living  i need to be able to earn as much as tracy does  and if you need to make millions of dollars  but have no real skills or education  the best place to do it is in entertainment  i mean look at me  i cant even find mexico on a map  things are a little tight at the company right now  but if you want to learn about the entertainment business  i can find you something  oh yeah im willing to start at the bottom

of your plan worked  yes she hated me  and yes i mentioned slavery by mistake  i knew i could count on you  but you also made me her boss so i fired her  she chased me around for a while  so i hid in a closet down on news  but then subhas and ann curry came in  just going to town on ea   damn it  is this a game for you two  i thought you were trying to help my family  my family  im not a pawn  i

god angie no  ow she pulled my hair out  i should never have made you an intern   youre a star  thats right i am  entertainment is where untalented people go  to get rich and you have all the makings  of a reality superstar hair pullingness  delusions of grandeur  an insanely short fuse   catchphrases  its my way till payday  thats the tshirt  i should give you your own reality show  friday nights   what that is when tgs or wrestling is on  i guess i could reconsider the time slot  in exchange for your signature  ugh you know what  im calling your bluff  youre not giving her a tv show  fyi i am friends with a hilarious fat girl  and a crazyeyed divorced white lady  who wants to be in the music business  oh id watch that   can dfwan be on it  mmhmm  with his even gayer boyfriend  okay fine

paula fight a lot  no ii walked into a door  im so clumsy  jack is using tgs  as leverage in our divorce  he says hes gonna replace us with a reality show about angie   oh id watch that  obviously  but how do i fight back  well first off you cant back down  if you do that we get nothing  i agreed to go to a furniture store  instead of watching football one time  and i havent seen a game since  oh i hear ya i mean take danny  please  then you got to hit them where it hurts  find their weakness and viciously exploit it  thats what marriage is  dont even get me started on marriage  thank you  kenneth your danny has something to tell you  what is it danny  well sport im gonna be moving out  i dont understand  well sometimes two people who care about each other  just cant live together  oh

artists  and theatrical jugglers  who will ask the world what is art  we know what art is  its paintings of horses  good morning  how is the happy couple today  well its no surprise were sitting here  you two have always thrown off  that will they or wont they vibe  and its been a real hoot to watch your courtship  okeydokey  now when two employees get married  it is my job to make sure that the employee  is not receiving favoritism from his or her boss  favoritism really hes trying to cancel my show  uhhuh and what about your little announcement last night  do you know how many fires  i had to put out this morning because of you  and what was that voice  it is my imitation of drew barrymores impression  of that crazy lady  lets keep this meeting short  our marriage is a technicality and it will be remedied  also in order for there to be favoritism  wed have to actually still be friends  all righty lets just dive on in  does the employee spend an inordinate amount of time  in the employers office compared to other employees  well yes i suppose  but only because miss lemon is incapable  of doing anything on her own  oh please half the time when i go up there  its to help you choose a tie and theyre all red or blue  where i come from  if you have more than two colors on a tie  it means youre looking for a certain kind of bar  are all workday conversations businessrelated  or do personal issues often dominate discussion  including but not limited to mothers diarrhea  having babies  problems in the bedroom neckties  food issues  foot disorders   having it all  okay  yes in the past we have advised each other  for instance jack taught me not to wear tan slacks  with a tan turtleneck  i thought it looked nice but he rightly pointed out  that it made me look like a giant condom  and lemon is the only one  of my subordinates whos not afraid to warn me  when im being too authoritative or handsome  or when you have eye boogers  have you spent time with each others families  have you attended special events together  such as class reunions  birthday or holiday celebrations  weddings  or extended car trips  are you each others emergency contacts  do you ever drink together at work  perhaps while summarizing what youve learned  over the day or week  have you shared intimate details  of your fears hopes and dreams  both personal and professional  is this the longest and perhaps most meaningful relationship  in your life  do you often find yourselves thinking the same thing  and then saying it at the exact same time   i apologize lemon  im sorry jack  i never should have tried to blackmail you  ill sign the papers  and i shouldnt have threatened your show  ill leave that to the parental decency groups  and ill back off on the budget  and the bat mitzvahs  okay  now were gonna do word association  foreplay  were done weinerslav  uh try to walk like a woman lemon  your flys open jack  im angie  i think elegance and attitude are the same thing
