help my weird buddy  but while i cant help directly  i have through backchannels like bet  back channels i have secured you a lifeline  the kabletown board has agreed to hear a presentation  from you tonight to convince them that  tgs is worth more alive than dead  perfect ive sold this show once  before you were even here and i crushed it  its a topical sketchcomedy show  for a little demographic thats i dont know   ill take that nod as a yes  lemon this is not a question of selling your creative vision  thanks to hazels lawsuit  tgs has cost this company millions of dollars  okay well we can make cuts  youll have to do a lot more  than trim the budget lemon  your show cant cost nbc any money at all   thats impossible  impossible  would any of your female heroes say that  would amelia earhart or dian fosse or joan of arc  boy women who try to do things sure get killed a lot  you know what i can do this  ive saved the show before and i aint afraid of no board  lemon expensive musical cues  are exactly the sort of thing you cant afford anymore  s07 ep11  a goons deed in a weary world   youve got lemon make lemonade  hey when do you think youre gonna be home  cause we gotta do some power nesting  upstairs i want to paint a mural of houston for the kids  but im terrible at drawing swamp humidity  i dont know criss late  im sorry ill make it up to you   sex on the couch  sex on the couch  thats a good one criss ill call you later  okay  listen up jagweeds its go time  we are at defcon 5 here  the lowest level of defense preparedness fantastic  have you dudes ever been to deafcon  the comic book convention for deaf people  man if youre a dude who can hear  you are just kneedeep in  this is serious our show is cancelled  now we all need to pull together  wing to wing and oar to oar  fine ill skip to the end  and that little boys name was marshall mathers  so whos with me  ll did you save the show yet  cause jmo and i have a new problem  last night at a party we urinated into the same fountain  during a lightning storm  and i think we switched brains  no i havent saved the show yet  i cannot save the show without all of us stepping up  we get one shot at this tonight  we have to do a sample show  so you guys need to start writing  we have to rally our fans  so you two are doing press all day  im glad the band u2 is doing press all day  jenna quick run before liz lemon realizes what i did  do you think this is a joke  if tgs goes away you are actors without a show  and hornberger you and i are gonna slash the budget  like weve never slashed it before  are you ready  my whole life has been building to this moment  has it really god  yeah  you wanted to see me sir  no  i wanted to see kenneth the page  kenneth the page  thats a name i havent heard in a long time  some say hes dead  but others hear his name on the wind  we dont have a lot of time here what do you say  i cant say no to these colors  i bleed blue and gray  especially where i stepped on that nail  excellent ive got a vip tour group coming in  and i want my most experienced page to lead it  now who will be on this tour  i like to cater my presentation to the audience  for example if theyre japanese  ill make sure we accidentally walk in  on a blonde woman peeing  kenneth youll be showing around the five final candidates  for my old job at nbc  now they think this just a formality  before the final interview  but the tour is the final interview  its an old ge trick  you can only truly judge a man  who doesnt know hes being judged  its like nbcs tv version of willy wonka  starring bob uecker  i do admire wonka hes a true capitalist  his factory has zero government regulations  slave labor and an indoor boat wonderful  during the tour the candidates will drop their guard  and show their true selves without even knowing it  and then you choose the one whos purest of heart  what no kenneth this is broadcast television  its a nasty ruthless business  no sir its a magical ruthfilled business  its dying and its leader needs to be a grave robber  wholl strip every last bauble off the corpse  im getting concerned about who were gonna pick here  there is no we kenneth youre giving a tour  im picking the next president of nbc understood  yes sir of course  not  all the right things we have to do to make the show cheaper  gut the crew no more taped pieces  fire danny scrap all the sets  and shoot everything on greenscreen  no greenscreen always looks so fake  yeah but to actually break even  we need somebody to sponsor the show  what then ill have some executive from nokia   giving me notes  you wish  we couldnt get them before the lawsuit  right now our only advertisers are nbccom  and a german guy who wants to eat somebody  and even gunters having doubts  okay so i need to find someone  to put their name on the show and i cant be picky  whatever it takes  i get it you need a sugar daddy  so dazzle me  why should bro body douche get in tgss panties   well broseph  sup  i think tgs and bro body douche  would be tight   totes  nah mean no homo   mos def  so jeah  look betty i dont know if it is jeah  tgs it sounds like a news channel  or an std you know ive got  we could change it were open to anything  thats what you said  look dont get me wrong  i like tracy jordan dudes a baller  i like that youve got a slut on the show  even if she is a little boned out  and i love the sexual harassment thing  noice  but if youre gonna get in bed with the douche  its not just gonna be the tip  this is senior year  were go need creative approval brand mentions  and the whole tone of the show needs to be more  have you ever seen the porn version  of transformers  blorch look do we have a deal  almost itd be weird if my show  were created by a woman  so could your credit be todd debeikis  its in honor of my frat bro died during hell week  after passing out in the trough  i went to syracuse  neverknewmydad  god  liz is wrong right  if the show goes away well be fine  yeah i got some stuff on the back burner  left unattended long enough the house burns down  insurance money  i mean lots of people got more famous  after their tv shows have ended like george clooney  we just need to have our next great roles lined up  like how after e r clooney had dumb gay batman  but parts like dumb gay batman  come around once in a generation  if tgs goes away what are the chances  that therell be two perfect roles  one for each of us  but we dont need two roles  if we play siamese twins   one is the president  the others santa claus  and theyre both in love with the same woman  elvira  tracy jenna so i hear youre rallying fans  to save your show  tell me whats going on with tgs  actually kristy wed like to talk about  our amazing upcoming project  its a movie called heads of state  colon the rise of doctor ronfulus  the third floor is also home to nbc news  fun news fact  the today show was originally designed  to entertain prison inmates whose iqs were too low  for them to be executed  what i think is a fun fact is that the todayshow is  nbcs most profitable news program  news funtertainment  with very low overhead  we pay most of our hosts in white wine  but im wondering is there a way  to make it even more profitable  more of a party atmosphere  food segments where you could order the food  show it again later on e but have gay guys make fun of it  i guess for some people  the today show is about money  but for me its about america starting its day together  and its about seeing your friends matt  and savannha and your butler al  i watch thetoday show  this morning out on the plaza  al made a classic weather pun  januwhere is the snow   yes  pure of heart  kenneth a word  was i not clear earlier about your role i this process  i am sorry sir but this is bigger than both of us  its nbc we comedy  kenneth its we peacock comedy  you say the peacock  what thats insane  i will continue with this tour myself parcell  your services are no longer required  hey im sorry i forgot you called  liz are you in favor of our kids having a trampoline  or do you hate fun  what no trampolines

for ladarius  whose wife died in a trampoline accident  ill call you back  stop i hate it  okay liz were about to start writing i swear  no of course you havent done anything  why would i ever think that you would  we did something ll  i play gretchen vanderhausen  a sexy 20something president  i play her siamese twin nick  a downonhisluck but muscular santa claus  the movie is being directed by michael ba io  scott baios uncle  it comes out 131313  which is january 13th 2014  and the theme song will be like rap breakdown  twins twins twins twins  i know what youre thinking liz  but it is possible to have twins who are different races  i saw it on maury it was a episode entitled  my obese toddler did my stepfathers makeover  we have two hours to save the show  but i guess ill just do it alone again  ill ignore everything thats going on in my life  and save your jobs for you  just one question out of curiosity  what would it take  i just remembered i gotta leave early  what would

into glue ken  that is a waste of delicious dead horse  mr donaghy dont do this  he may have a fancy degree and know lots of business terms  like meeting and envelope  but if all he cares about is the
