europe  whats his name  i dont know his real name  i got his phone number  thats all  okaygood enough  ill take it  ohandby the wayi should mention  i went through your fridge while you were out  do you know its one of the most frequently used hiding places  found this in the orange sherbet  i assume youre holding it for someone  ill keep it until our job is finished  until thenyou keep your mouth shut about our little chat  even the most careful spy leaves a trail that could get them burned  a patriot making illicit deals for his government  looks a lot like a traitor making blackmarket sales for his wallet  somebody upstairs gets the wrong idea  and suddenly youre burned and out of a job  mikepiece of advice  ladies like attention  they dont want to be second to a dossier  not even a big one  youve been talking to fi  if by talking to fi you mean listening to fi thenyeah  solooki got ahold of my contacts at the fbi  about the guy who put your little dossier together  they were not very helpful at all  they stuck me with the bill  did you get anything  everything i know about philip cowan  who works for the national security agency  fits right here on the back of the receipt  ill read it for you  he works counterintel for the nsa thats it  thats all i got  is there any way to reach him  mikeyou know these nsa guys theyre like ghosts  they got no phone numberno addressno nothing  sorry i couldnt be more help  guess ill have to find another way to get in touch with him  hows your jewel thing going  i could use some more helpactually  i need you to run down a phone number  it belongs to a jewel thief  make you a deal  ill talk to my cop buddies  you cover my little working lunch  you want one  theyre awesome  thomas is a hell of a cook  playing catch  hes teaching me baseball  its really nothing like cricket  sams checking up on the real thief  so thomas should be out of here soon enough  ohno rush  i like having him around  thanks for suggesting it  i need a favorfi  i need you to reach out to your blackmarket contacts  the scarierthe better  is this about the dossier  its about the man who burned me  hes hard to reach  i need to recruit some help  how you gonna do it  ive been accused of being a major security risk  its time i started acting like one  i know a few iranians who are coming into town  lets avoid people who use michael westen and jihad in the same sentence  how about libyans  i hear theres a group here talking to some south american oil companies  see if you can set it up  heymike  hello  phone number you gave me belongs to lawrence henderson  does he work at the hotel  i wouldnt say work he owns it  i meanfor nowat least  he bet big on the victor  now hes got a cashflow problem  soif you do the mathits a little screwy  hes got 2 million bucks for a brooch  but thats not gonna bail him out of his hole  but it might give him a year or two to turn things around  lawrence henderson  hotel owner thief  cops ever look at him  nothey cleared him  he had an alibi and a fleet of lawyers to sell it  a few years backhe had a club in new orleans  it was hit byi guess youd call ita very convenient fire  almost killed a busboy  he got the hotel with the insurance money  got a hell of a security setup  hes a little paranoid  even paranoids have enemiessam  youre living proof of that  what are you saying  wella little i mean  we should go  the guy who owns the victor did this to me  i dont even know him  its not personal  you handled the brooch  you had easy access  youre an easy fall guy  sowhat now  i meancan we go to the cops with that guy cristo  what do we tell them  i broke into his house and extorted information from him  meanwhilelawrence ditches the brooch  cristo denies everything  and the only guys that go to jail are you and me  its fine  hard or easyyour choice  take thomas out the back   noi   fi  right   you  can we talk  noim done talking  watch your head  ohdamn  when youre giving 5 inches and 100 pounds to a welltrained opponent  it helps to know the terrain better than he does  that step is hard to see  i did the same thing earlier  whered they go  i cant tell you if you keep choking me  italy was one of my favorites  thank you  he has to stay with you  with mefi  my place isnt safe  we just left the worlds largest bounty hunter knocked out on my front lawn  guyslooki dont want to cause problems  i can go stay at a motel or something  nodont be silly  cheap motels are the first place guys like wayne are gonna look for bail jumpers  michaels fine having you here  yeah  wellyou guys are the expertsi guess  seriouslymanthanks  well figure this outthomas  tell him about the planmichael  the plan  theres a plan  ohyeahtheres a plan  im gonna pose as a buyerset up a sale  get lawrence to bring the brooch out into the open  then the cops will arrest him  and we will be celebrating your freedom by the end of the week  heyfican i  can we talk about the plan  just  what are you doing  im not doing anything were working  nothis is differentand you know this is different  i didnt think we were in a relationshipmichael  do you want something to drinkthomas  maybe a yogurt  mixing romance and work is a bad idea  veronicajust the other day  she asked me if bullets came in different sizes  isnt that the cutest thing youve ever heard  that is so adorable  samyou gonna help me on this  yeah  when have i ever said no  lawrence needs a buyer  thatll be me  youre the middleman  cristo is setting up an appointment with you and lawrence  sowhats my cover id  a shady international business guy  yeahsomething like that  youre gonna take point on this deal  ohthat means i got to shave and put on a suit  its 90 humidityand i got to come on all professional  and paranoid  extremely securityconscious so he doesnt have to be  veronica and i were gonna go to the keysmike  sam  okayokaybut i just got to go on record  i think this whole thing with fiona is unhealthy  you got to go through all this crap just to get some guy she picked up out of your place  okayill break out the suit  a good cover identity is a team effort  if you want to meet someoneits a good idea to play a little hard to get  put people between yourself and the target  make them come to you  yesim looking for a mr henderson  ahthank you  mr henderson  charles finley  we spoke on the phone  its good to meet you  cristo said you were a good man  he he vouched for you  listencan i get you a drink  some 20yearold single malt  thanksbut no  i im not a drinker  lookill get right

ask around  my situation has changed  my side isnt talking to me anymore  so that leaves you guys  dont make up your mind right now  do your homework  see what you think  im around  are in their convertible at the gas station  and she had her baby in the back  am interrupting something  thomas made dinner  yeahto say thank you  iuhi did make some for youmikebutum  we ate it because it was so good  howd it go with sam  great the meeting is set with lawrence  if i can get him to bring the brooch out into the open  we can get him caught with it  so i might get to go home soon  lets hope so  hes locked down pretty tight  hes either expecting an armored assault  or he has something to protect  unfortunatelywe only have a few minutes  we have some important meetings  wellthank you for comingmr uh  smith  smith  yes typicallywith this sort of deal  we like to keep things not so personalyou understand  for security purposes  normallyi do not like to do meetings in person  but for a piece like thisi was willing to make an exception  wellthe way i see it  you cant trust a man if you cant look him in the eye  am i right  of course youre right  mr finleyyou can wait right here  its important that i stay  charlesthats fine  wellthe least i can do is  ill take care of it  something to drinksir  yeahwater will be just great  thank you  so how did you hear about me  ive worked with cristo before  and the people youve contacted in europe  arent being as discreet as you might like  is that right  word is out  none of my businessbut i would sell quickly  it might not be long before somebody tries  to take it off your hands without your consent  shall we say  welllet me worry about that  that brooch isnt going anywhere soon  ohdont be pessimistic  let me see what i can do to pry it loose  brass tacksthen  the item is worth 2 million  i could give it to you for 175 million cash  for something i have to cut up into little pieces  hmmno  12 million is more than generous  then lets call it 16 million and be done  let me show you something  stolen from an armored truck over two years ago  i picked it up this morning for 50 cents on the dollar  would you like to talk to cristo about it  125 million  im being very generous offering 12 million  fine  in cash  smallused bills  excellent  of courseill need to see it first  just because someone believes you are who you say you are  doesnt mean hell do what you want him to do  there it is  cute  im serious  mr smiththis brooch isnt coming out to play  till you come back with the money in that little case of yours  fine  we do the deal tomorrowbut not here  we have to take the diamonds out to an independent lab for authentication  we do it herewhere i can control it  or it doesnt happen at all  im afraid an independent testing site is a deal breaker for me  then im afraid we dont have a deal  pity  lawrence needs the money  he thinks its too risky to move the brooch now  what do we do  convince him its too risky to stay put  i already planted the idea that somebody might be trying to steal it  we need to back that uppush on his paranoia    i thought you said that his place was impossible to get into  it is  between the security systemthe guardsand the safe  wed need a small army   well just have to make him think weve got a small army  christthis is turning into a full psychop campaign  what are we talking about here  psychological warfare  give you an example  us used to broadcast static to soviet listening posts  trying to get them to think it was some new kind of cipher  so they spent all kinds of rubles  basically trying to decode white noise  we need to convince the enemy were stronger than we are  yeahexcept it takes forever  mikei was supposed to go car shopping with veronica  were talking cadillacsyou know  you need to do it next week  we got a lot of work to do  you two scout it out  i got to get ready for the meeting  clandestine meetings are never fun to arrange  its a big part of the job for a covert operative  but its never pleasant  get in  wheres anwar  its not so much the fear of death that bothers you  its driving to the meet with a bag over your head  sometimes they wash the bag  sometimes they dont  guysyoure really missing out on the miami beach scene  staying in a place like this  have you checked out the beach hotels  theyre surprisingly affordable in the offseason  guys  okayyou wanted to talk  talk  you checked out my situationi assume  your own people turned on you  yes so what  now youre working for us  why should i believe this  your government would like to know  who attacked your gassupply depot in ghadamis in 2002  i could supply that information  and why would you do this for us  the us and libya have mutual enemies  this would be a winwin situation for everyone  welleveryone except for the guys who blew up the gassupply depot  why dont i just make you tell methen kill you  you could do that  the information might or might not check out  torture is unreliableas you know  and then youd have to deal with fiona  who put me in touch with you  more trouble than its worthtrust me  all right  what do you want  im trying to reach out to the man who burned me  nsa officer philip cowan  i just need you to mention him as a friend of yours  when you know the americans are listening  a friend  and say what  i dont know  have the head of your secret police send him a fruit basket  be creative  hell try to figure out what the hell is going on  andin no timehell figure out its me  well think about it  i love this part  you ready back there  drive  the thing about security is that the very things  that protect you can be turned against you  by someone who knows what hes doing  its tough to compromise a wellthoughtout security system  but making someonethink you can compromise it  wellthats much easier  take surveillance camerasfor example  you can disable one by shooting a laser at it  and overloading the lightsensitive chip  cheapeasy  and exactly the sort of thing  a sophisticated criminal gang with lots of resources would do  leave around some telltale signs of surveillance  like cigarette buttsa forgotten cameralens cap  and the more security there is  the more likely they are to think theyve got a very serious problem  even the security team itself can be an opportunity  the more employees you have  the more you have to worry about  hello   can i help you   maybe  you work at the hendersons  youre tedright  yeahwho are you  my name isnt important  weve been watching you  you look like you could use a little help  well be in touch  deliver some vague threats and a few hundred bucks to a security guard  if hes honesthell tell his boss  who then wonders whowasntso honest  for the cost of a nice dinner  you can get a whole security team canned   here you gorocky  okay man  thank you  mikei got to tell you  this is more fun than i expected  i meani havent done this sort of thing since  geesince there was an east germany  glad youre enjoying yourself  sohow are things at home  a little strange  fiona likes to test relationships with the emotional equivalent of artillery fire  does she even want this guy  i dont know ive never been able to figure her out  wellim not one to tell you how to live your life  hang on  its our buddy lawrence  charles finley here  yes  wellim not sure if the offer still stands  but i can talk to him  no guaranteesbut ill do my best  byebye   howd it go  good  i think we got him whipped into a pretty good lather  he wants to meet you at the hotel  ill let him stew for a bit  call him back when im done with my slushie  mr smithits good to see you  we can have our meeting in my office  i was about to leave town when charles called  im happy to talkbut my conditions havent changed  we just have some issues with timing details  its right this way  one of the dangers of any kind of psychological warfare  is it can betooeffective and send the target into a paranoid tailspin  i have to thank you for telling me to check my security  weve had some problems at the house  happens all the time in this business  better safe than sorry  i agree entirely  that paranoia can be useful or deadly  at firsti thought it might be one of the europeans  i was talking to about the brooch  trying to rip me off  and then i thought that didnt make sense  so i saidit might be cristo  so i brought him in  listenwhatever he told youwhatever you think  he has said some very interesting things about you  on his carotid artery  hell bleed out in 20 seconds  let him go  thats not all you have to worry about  i could crush his windpipe with the tie if im not careful  oops back off  back off  back off  next timelawrencego limp  its really hard to drag a human shield  jesus i meanhe really tried to kill you  it didnt get that farbut it was heading in that directionyeah  i meanw what are you gonna do  i meanh he knows who you are  nohe just knows im not who i said i was  a big difference  he still thinks were gonna rip him off  he still thinks his security system is compromised  hes still got to move the brooch  and weve still got to get him busted  we just need to figure out where hes taking it  but how are we gonna do that  ive got some friends  there he is  hey  howd it go you work your magic  magic was made  you have something for me  michael wanted you to know that that was compliments of cristo  ticohit me  bloody mary  well in that caselawrence has accounts at five banks in the miami area  only one with a safedeposit operation is dade trustdowntown  yeahany good  you kidding  best in miami  thank you  if hes moving that broochhell go there  nice  what else can you tell me about dade trust  you buying lunch  youre the money launderfor christs sake  why doihave to buy lunch  i knowi knowget in  can we do it without the head bag  i hate the head bag  sothis information you havewe are interested  and philip cowan  arrangements are being made  that should give you what you need  to find out who the team was that blew up your gas depot  dont be gentle on them  they hurt a lot of innocent people  the security services in my country are not known for being gentle  michaelif you ever want a job real work  let us know  im flatteredbut ive got someplace to be  the key to good security is good systemsconsistency  but those very systems make you predictable  where will you take your valuables  a bank you trust  how are you going to get there  with armed men in a big suv  when will you go  when the bank is least crowded  all good procedureall 100 predictable  fitheyre on their way  yo  all setsam  im here good to go  looks like theyre taking the highway  they should be there in 5  ill

here  ohmy god  i have to go  if you know someones going to be at a bank at a particular time  its not hard to make it look like theyre robbing the bank  shoot out a few videosurveillance cameras  block off the street with a stolen car  like theyre preparing an escape route  fire up a sparkgap transmitter to kill the security radios at the bank  and theyll look like they know what theyre doing  mr smithyoure too late  you sure  check the top floor of the building behind you  gun  youll like prisonlawrence  drop your weapon  they got a lot of cool security systems  this is a mistake  thats minethats mine    t thats mine  thats mine  quiet turn around  all this to clear the name of an innocent man  thats noble  you should be proud  you know who i did this forfi  all rightim here  what couldnt you say over the phone  bondsman wont have anything to do with me now  that youve told him i was aiding and abetting  so i was thinkingwhen you collect your bounty  maybe we could split it
