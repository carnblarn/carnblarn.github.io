in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you   a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them

line  until you figure out who burned you youre not going anywhere   in the world of intelligence if an operative hands you a crossword puzzle  chances are youve just received a coded message  its the art of steganography   sending coded messages that dont look like messages unless you have the key  meet at marwa mall noon  fiona so does this new handler of yours set all her meetings with crossword puzzles  or is she just flirting with you  michael these people burned me blacklisted me and threatened my family  i think were a little past flirting  keep the engine running   if you see her leave   tail her i know  we cant take more proactive measures  theres room in the trunk  the idea is to find out who shes working for without her knowing fi  it calls for something a little more subtle than throwing her in the trunk   you ready sam  all set  listen mike uh i hate to bring this up but is this gonna take a while  cause i got a meeting of my own i got to get to  yeah the pilates class with veronica fi told me  look its a great way to strengthen your core okay  give me a break will you  im in the doghouse with veronica and its all your fault  yeah shes still all over me about how the cadillac got all banged up  i wont make you late sam  just make sure you get a shot of carla before you go  in covert ops you always want to be the one setting the meeting  when youre following someone elses instructions  they set the agenda they control the security  and they get to make you jump through hoops to remind you they are in charge  carla hello michael  can i get you something to drink  carla the new handler  ill have what youre having  i dont think they serve qishr here  mmm yemenese coffee  i prefer to brew it myself  drinks you get in restaurants you never  quite know whats

working with people like you  wed like the duplicate and the original back in two days  then what  were done with the burn notice i get my life back  its not that simple michael  not by a long shot

cargo anymore okay  yeah you tell him that my god  hey uh you el jefe  you ship stuff cause i got stuff to ship  im talking pilates equipment  a lot of it  you know its those things that are in gyms theyre like big beach balls  all of a sudden every joker in tampas got to have them  so i need to make this happen like you know yesterday  you have the wrong place  well hear me out i mean these are your trucks right  im just  im just looking to rent a little extra space  you know uh off the books frankly  sorry all of our spaces are taken  oh i get it okay ill play your game  how much you want  like 5 bucks a cub  leavenow  well just consider that a down payment for the future  okay thanks a lot you have a good one now take care  okay big opportunity right out the window there  see you guys have a good one   who are you  who am i what do you mean  we stopped by rauls work  hes loading trucks full of lidocaine and coffee cans  i dont knowi dont underst  lidocaine is used to cut cocaine and coffee masks the smell from the dogs  dios mio drugs  drugs shocking  you never saw anything huh  now it never occurred to you that most trucking executives dont drive in porsches and carry mac10s  please dont hurt me  you approached sam at a cooking class which costs more than you earn all week  and then you happen to mention a sad story about raul  what a coincidence  sam can help  im telling you the truth  who are you  im dea im a cop  ive been undercover for two years making a case against rauls boss campos  he runs a billion dollars in cocaine through miami for the valdez cartel  and raul is his numbertwo guy in charge of security  okay look  is raul really stalking you or was that a lie too  no its the truth  the hostess job at ernestos is my cover  thats where campos likes to eat and talk business  i tried not to draw attention to myself but raul noticed me  and if you went to the dea with your problem theyd pull you off the job  yeah my investigation would be over  ive worked too hard to let that happen and thats why i came to you  nice touch approaching me through sam  well im sorry i lied  but i needed to be sure youd help me  youd do the same thing ive heard the stories  what stories  there are rumors about a guy who took on the cartel a while back  i found the people you helped and they told me what you did  dont believe everything you hear  listen i dont care who you were i just need help  they have a big shipment coming in a few days  im really close to finding out where  but not if raul kills you first  i could go to jail for involving you  im out here alone do you understand  yeah actually  i have a pretty good idea what thats like  ernestos  thats where i work  theres campos  he and raul meet every day for lunch  campos the boss  is that kind of firepower normal or is this a special occasion  campos is in a turf war with the mexicans  they put a hit out on him last week its pretty ugly  uglys good we can work with ugly  how  i need to get in with raul quietly make myself useful get some information  then i let campos know that raul is spilling information to a new friend behind his back  campos deals with raul for us and it looks like you had nothing to do with it  you make it sound so easy  that sounded easy   raul  where the hell are you  on the buscoming to work  i called youleft you messages  you didnt answer or call back  who are you with  im not with anyonerual  if you are lying   i sweartheres no one here  well talk about it when i see you  you dont have to do this  i know  sam told me about your latest client  she sounds like a handful  just helping her with a job  where did all these checks come from  barry whatever you said to him must have been convincing  these are leftovers from a defunct shell company  what are you doing with them  becoming a forger  approach the tunisian with a few phony checks  and youre not just a client youre a colleague  check fraud is more about technique than hightech equipment  some old checks a roll of scotch tape some nailpolish remover and youre in business  nailpolish remover is mostly acetone which dissolves ink  get your hands on a check thats been filled out by the account holder  dissolve everything but the signature and youve got yourself a blank check  counterfeiters call it check washing  there may be no honor among thieves but theres a certain amount of respect  establishing youre in the same racket is a great way to make an introduction  nefzi right  how did you find me  barry  nefzi the counterfeiter  barry referred you  ah manner of speaking  he called you a son of a bitch which i figured anybody barry doesnt like cool by me  anyway i took this job i got to dupe this  little out of my league  im good with papers not with computers  i think this is a computer thing right  yes its a computer thing  why would anyone believe you could do this  did i mention im good with papers  check fraud is for children  counterfeiting electronics takes real skill  no argument from me thats why im coming to you  i can do this job but uh itll cost you  yeah i figured maybe we could do a whatchamacallit  like the barter  you know i give you some of my work and you do the badge for me  this is hackwork i can do in my sleep  cash only  10000  5000 now 5000 on delivery  okay  people who try to cheat me  they regret it you understand me  i wouldnt dream of it  when can i get the badge back  i can have a basic knockoff by tomorrow  but if you want a better quality itll take a few days  take your time  yeah mom  michael im at the counselors office  you missed our appointment  oh um some something came up i should have called  yeah well they have a very strict cancellation policy here michael  its worse than the airlines  ill pay for the session  thats not the point  hello  carla you look upset  is everything okay  yeah everythings fine  just some personal issues  thanks for asking  if you need to talk michael im here for you  i appreciate that  why dont you give me your home number and ill take you up on that   i assume well be getting our badges soon  a few days  that wasnt what was agreed to  we were expecting them sooner  yeah well thats the best i can do  i doubt that michael  yeah the man im looking for  and why is that  youre in  lets call it the shipping business and me lets call me a consultant  now a guy moving your kind of cargo is always looking to make it go from point a to point b  i can help with this job  i can make your life easier  a lot easier for the right price  i dont know what youre talking about  i import coffee  right and i used to work for the mexicans lets cut the crap  sophia  you know where i come from talk like that  can get you killed  well im sure you wouldnt want blood all over that nice suit so why dont you just hear me out  talk  i busted my ass for the mexicans  they didnt truly appreciate what i do  and what is it exactly that you do  i expedite things  i got a lot of friends  who are these friends  police customs on the docks  anything beyond that id be giving away my trade secrets  but i can assure you that your deliveries would come on time hasslefree   how does that sound  too good to be true  strange that you come to me not to my boss  what do i want with your boss  youll be my boss i dont even want to meet campos  i mean the way i see it im just here to make you look good me to make money  as long as im paid you can be the hero  you know if youre interested give me a call  sit allow me to buy you a drink no  s  sophia  my girlfriend  raul i have to work  yesyes my love  we need a tabke for two and a bottle of dom  very nice girl huh  catholic  a volcano waiting to erupt  she loves me more than her own life  thats a lot  mom  i wanted to apologize for you know missing our appointment  michael the new coffee maker  thank you  thats more than enough apology  why didnt you wake me last night  i was in a hurry  madeline uh excuse me  you were here long enough to read the paper  did your mom like the coffee maker  i picked it out myself  builtin grinder integrated water filter  makes up to 10 cups  perfect for her weekly poker game  yeah id stay away from her  you were the one that told me i needed to buy her a coffee maker  what about these do you like these  it depends on where youre staying  theyre nice for south beach but if youre in coral gables id go with something conservative  always pushing always probing  its cute  but you need to understand something  right now you work for us  and who would that be  theres an easy way to do this and a hard way  i like my way  is that why you decided to take your time delivering the badges   to see how i would respond   quality work takes time  right right  every puppy starts off chewing the furniture michael  eventually they learn  next time i give you a deadline i expect you to meet it  dont test me again or the next time i leave a gift at your moms house  its not gonna be a coffee maker  if you want to make a friend solve a problem for them  no problem to solve create one  almost done michael  make it look professional  yeah im gonna pretend you didnt say that  you getting friendly with raul  yeah friendly enough if i know my drug cartels  it wont take much longer to make it look like hes going behind the boss back  got to go  hes searching your car  relationships are about trust  people trust you when they have something on you   like say the name and address of a mistress in orlando or information about a secret gambling habit  its all about making them feel secure   money problems  thats my business  relax  if things go well everythings okay  if it doesnt  we know where your friends and your family are   a little insurance in case you get scared and run to the police  fine  maybe now youll give me a route and shipping information so i can do my job  that is not how it works  then how the hell am i supposed to help you with the mexicans and the police if you keep me in the dark  you tell me what you know first  man this is a waste of my time  no you sit  people dont trust information they get for free  if you want to sell someone on a lie you have to make them drag it out of you  its effective but often painful  you said you can be useful no fine you tell me something  it checks out we talk if not  all right  the dea  they got a gps tracking device on one of your trucks  i got a source in the das office  how could you be so stupid  ive always liked to think that the c in counseling stands for communication  it sounds like what madeline needs is for you  to share something from that part of your life thats been closed off  nothings coming to mind  youre missing the point  youre right ma i am  lets try it this way  madeline um you mentioned there were times  when you wanted more communication but didnt get it  can you share an example with michael  every year michael called me on my birthday  about eight years ago he forgot  i was very upset and i never understood why he didnt communicate  michael would you like to respond  at the time i was stationed overseas transporting a colleague to a locked facility  there were some individuals who were trying very hard to prevent me from doing my job  i was injured and in a field hospital for six weeks  they didnt have a phone so i could not communicate  excellent  now its your turn michael  my turn  when i was 9 i stole groceries because dad blew his paycheck  go on  the owners son tommy knox the bag boy caught me while i was running out   pounded me pretty good gave me a black eye  but i got away with the groceries  when i got home you took the groceries mom but you never asked me about the black eye  any communication about that  boys fight michael  i thought youd bought the groceries  then why did we never go back to that store  madeline  lets talk about the time that we went to disney world  so what made you pick her  there was something about her i liked  i dont know what i was thinking  really i didnt think it was so bad   yeah  its raul  ive been thinking about your proposal  meet me at the restaurant  raul whats going on  whats going on  well that is what i would like to know  what are you talking about what is this  a friend of mine used to be in the secret service in venezuela  he knows how to find things like phone records  i had him look in sophias cellphone  you two were talking no  did you think that i would not find out  i dont know what shes told you  she did not tell me nothing  i had to figure it out for myself  now i will ask you the same thing i asked her  how long have you and this puta been sleeping together  you are out of your mind raul  do you think that i am stupid  no i dont think youre stupid raul i know you are  inexperienced operatives abandon a cover idunder pressure  experienced ones just play their roles harder  stop wasting my time  of course i talked to sophia  im checking up on you  you dont think i do my homework on the people im doing business with  im a professional  please raul  i wish that i could trust you  nothing happened  you know shes right nothing  she wouldnt give you up  i tried to give her money she wouldnt take it  but if you want to shoot her go ahead   in fact ill do it myself  no  you did that for me  why didnt you tell me  i was scared  you have nothing to be afraid of  were going somewhere nice tonight  can we talk now  we done playing games  no  it is time for you to meet the boss  yeah remember we said no bosses  thats not how i operate  i dont care that is how i operate  mike thats gonna screw up the whole plan  i thought the idea here was to make raul seem like a traitor  well how you gonna catch him selling secrets behind his bosss back  when hes standing right in front of the guy introducing you  if we cant make raul a traitor one way were gonna have to do it another way  fi get me a sniper rifle and some c4  ooh i like where this is going  i just opened that  we have work to do  morning fellas how you doing  im back good to see you  most people think distracting a group of guys is best done by a beautiful woman  the problem with beautiful women is people want them to stick around  which can cause a lot of problems  ever seen one of these  i got plenty more ready to go look  i got to talk to your supervisor again  tell him im offering some real money okaymucho   obnoxious guys they just want to get rid of  dinero  see that was a good upperbody workout  you know youre just uh uh  you truly are bullies okay okay okay got it  raul says you may be able to help us  he told me about the gps device what else do you know  i know your operation has problems  vulnerabilities  vulnerabilities  you have problems with your perimeter out there  i know how the feds are getting to your trucks  show me  you see those boats theyre an easy access point  you ready sam go  im not talking about fencingim talking about a wall   you know blocking the view from the street  im in a meetingsophia  im sorryi dont want to bother youbut i need your help  whats wrong  theres a man here  hes drunk and keeps putting his hands all over me  hey come on over here mamacita come over here and meet chuck  give it up give me some  stay right there  i have to go  i need to handle something with sophia at the restaurant  im sorry  you dont think raul would ever  nah   what  i dont know  raul would never go to the cops   of course not  no i know  its just that sophias not at work today  so why is he going to the restaurant to meet her  most assassinations involve the firing of a single wellplaced bullet  get down  the trick to selling an assassination attempt is to use a lot more firepower  and an explosion or two doesnt hurt  raul set you up  find raul  bring him to me   drug cartels have their own internal justice system  it doesnt involve courts or lawyers or proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt  if they think you might be a traitor theyll kill you just to be on the safe side  run raul run baby  and we fit a half a kilo of cocaine in every can  look im not talking anymore okaynot until im   im sure that you can protect me from campos  dont worry you cooperate well take care of you  just got to make sure youre telling us everything  so were gonna have you talk to one of our agents   someone who knows your operation pretty well  hello raul  howd it go  raul took a plea  hes headed to a maximumsecurity facility for his own protection  with what he gave us campos will be going away for a long time too  i cant thank you enough   if theres anything   there is  the rumor you heard about me  keep it a rumor  dont worry  cant even tell the difference  of course you cant  it took three prototypes but that ones my masterpiece   now the rest of the money  yeah  hey any way of telling what these things are for  of course there are ways  theres an extra 5 grand in the bag if you could tell me  you know i got a guy who wants to know what buildings these get you into  i can find out  come back next week  in intelligence a good adversary lets you think youre winning  they know the best attack is the one you dont see coming  so you learn to be vigilant when you think youve got the upper hand  because thats when theyll strike  nefzi  if you walk in on a corpse and cant catch your breath  you might be suffering from a panic attack  or someone might be pumping nitrogen gas into the room to displace all the oxygen  its not a bad way to kill someone  they suffocate before they realize theres a problem  it wont show up on a tox screen and theres no trail left behind  unless you know where to look  there are a lot of disadvantages to being at the scene of a crime  you can get arrested  you can get yourself killed  and no matter how many times youve done it its never fun hanging out with a dead body  but the advantage is theres no one around to object to a little intelligence gathering  mom  hi honey want some coffee i made a pot  no uh we got to go dont we have the session  i decided to find another counselor  someone who has better questions  mom what i did while i was away i dont like to talk about  but if you want to spend time together we can do that  we can take a pottery class together  no thanks  thats all i need is another ugly ceramic ashtray  i remember when you came home with the groceries  you said you bought them  and you looked so proud  that it broke my heart  i thought that you didnt want me to know michael  i always hated that bag boy  its nice to know i was right about him  he was awfully good dont you think  are you gonna kill everyone i talk to  better them than you michael  no more nitrogen gas no more highpowered rifles  all right fine  oh look you forgot your money  no im never gonna work for you carla not that way  thats okay michael  ill hold on to it for you  no coffee today  sorryi have another meeting  but well be in touch  sam hey mike whats up  yeah sam i think i got something  carla speaks arabic with a kurdish accent  you think she was stationed there  i was hoping you could ask around  will do
