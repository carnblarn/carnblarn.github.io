our thief  yeah im told hes a total psycho  you know this is the reason why i dont look forward to virgils visits     one of the reasons  listen were in the homestretch here we just gotta get the medicine out in the open  look ill run point okay ill go in as a buyer   fine the sooner we get this done  im all over it mikey  so you gonna hook up with fis arms dealer friend hows that going  yeah

not a cop  see kill two birds right   whoa whoa whats this  you said you wanted a gun  no no no i wanted information about a sniper rifle  oh right the dragunov  i mean i could maybe import one from this guy in the czech republic  no im not looking to buy a sniper rifle seymour  i just need to track down a place where someone can calibrate it   do me a favor wave at that guy    uh if im not mistaken thats one of the guys who shot at us  he is bringing the rest of the money see fifty gs   and why would i wave at him  i told him you and me dont have a beef with him anymore  we we seymour do not have a beef with him   you have a beef with him  whatever look look here he comes  and hes not bringing your money he has a gun and im not part of this  damn it lli told him well talk later       for certain kinds of criminals  partying hard serves an important management function  you can keep your eye on your employees during the offhours  and keep them spending money  so theyre hungry for the next score   did you miss me  scotch and soda   you finley  i am youre gerard  get out of here  yeah feldman said youd be by he didnt tell me a whole hell of a lot   so youre what a gun dealer  i deal in everything  guns so people can shoot each other medicine to get em ready for round two  even somali warlords need penicillin my friend  so i hear youre in um acquisitions   hostile takeovers  ah i got a client breathing down my neck for antivirals  feldman said you had a shipment to spare  antivirals thats bad timing i sold those a couple hours ago  well thats a shame i assume they havent been delivered yet  maybe they can be unsold my client has deep pockets  the deals done we deliver next week     excuse me a second    dont touch me  why dont you calm down and go play with your boyfriend   bar fights arentjust a way to blow off steam  theyre a great way to showcase your leadership skills  and theyre a teambuilding exercise  watch it there broken bottle can hurt someone   theres also no better way for someone new to get noticed  okay if this guy gerard sold the medicine what can we do  maybe we could get the cops to sting the buy  buyer shows up cops swoop in  we dont know when the delivery is  and if the cops get involved gerard might find out no forget it  wait a minute i got an in with this guy  we can use that to find out where hes keeping this medicine   we just need an inside man  an inside man what does that mean  he wants me to join gerards crew  so i can find out where he hides the stuff that he steals  no sam i cant  mikey come on let mejust pitch a whole new heist  something where hes gotta bring you in well never actually have to do it  just has to look good get him talking  virgil can you get us a yacht  you know i think i probably can  i helped a rich guy out in fort lauderdale  sank his catamaran before his exwife could get it  he might be in an accommodating frame of mind  guys you think you can find the medicine  i dont really have any idea but we gotta give it a shot      michael you home  you are not here   arent you gonna invite me in  oh im in a hurry ma im going to meet fi   but i made you this  you baked a pie  okay i just

a connection michael a romantic connection  an intimate steamy connection  im just saying that when an important woman in your life meets someone  it can be an adjustment   is this about your date because im fine with it    i dont think so michael  not one question about who he is youre not in the least bit interested  no not interested  i thought spies were meant to be good liars  you are

yesterdays little brawl  some people dont understand their place in the food chain  not afraid to get your hands dirty i like that   i got a job for you  no thanks i dont do work for hire  well then consider yourself a partner in a very lucrative business opportunity  what do you know about designer performance enhancers   you mean like steroids  more like steroids on steroids  i know a lab that makes undetectable stuff next generation  human tissue 100 biological its worth millions  theyre running a shipment up north on a yacht   you want us to hit it  shipments worth 2 million  youd get a third how does that sound  a third sounds like work for hire half sounds like a partnership  all right done  you handle the heist but you gotta bring in a pro  to keep the drugs at the right temperature and humidity   you got someone in mind  yeah works at the lab his name is jackson  he used to cook meth before he got into designing steroids  youre gonna convince him to help   convince him  im sure you can be persuasive   why dont you do it  me oh no  no in my line of work you stay in the shadows  so the name finley is never mentioned  we clear on that partner   dealing with an aggressive adversary  isnt always about showing strength   you jackson  sometimes its best to show weakness  if they believe they can dominate you theyll drop their guard   of course that means getting dominated    a heist seriously no no no im a chemist i dont do heists  guys with guns violence thats why i got out of meth  i mean its just not my thing it makes my chest tight   i cant

that moves the stuff he takes off in the morning   how bigs your cargo  uh six canisters not so big   so what do we need to do with them  you gotta pack it in coolers  you gotta get it inside a custom liquid air rig asap as soon as  uh because you let this stuff warm up and it is a its a nasty cocktail   cocktail  i can train one of your guys to move it off the boat   one of my guys youre the guy  what  no no li got a thing with boats andand water  and l i get  i get i get seasick  i mean look at me can you crack a window   well scrounge up some dramamine  then theyll recognize my face   well

all right  thats one       hey fi  michael just called me from a bar does the number 1820 mean anything to you  yeah a place in the marina why  im gonna miss my movie     when you need to distract

makeup and i didnt see you and  let me give you my insurance information  oh so silly    okay  how about just your number and well call it even    do you have a pen   do you have a pen   sorry no  oh

i dont want him dead just bruised  hurry up looks like the shows starting   beautiful there you go   counterfeiting pharmaceuticals is pretty straightforward  fill some vials with your choice ofbeverage  the trick is to keep people from looking closer  with some compressed gas from your local farming supply store  and a few cryogenic containers  you can convince people that if they get a little too curious  they could lose a finger to frostbite  where wheres my mask i need my mask   you dont need one  what are you talking about  i told you the guy on the boat will recognize me if i dont get a mask so i need a mask  let him he can tell it to the fishes  the fish what youre gonna kill him  trust me jackson its better this way no loose ends   dealing with a trained operative is like playing chess with a master  dealing with criminals on the other hand  is like playing checkers with a threeyearold  they like to change the rules   well i need a gun i need a gun gimme a gun  you said you didnt want one  yeah well man that was before i knew people were gonna be shot  and if youre gonna shoot people theyre gonna shoot back  and if they shoot back theyll probably hit me so i need a gun  im not going on the boat unless l   you happy  yeah   using a zodiac to catch a yacht has certain advantages  its low to the water so its hard to see coming  it tops out at a brisk 60 miles per hour  and its designed to turn on a dime  of course the one disadvantage is it can make for a bumpy ride  shut it down  take it anything you want boat anything   wheres the shipment  its the steel canisters in the fridge  get to the bow   find them   all right lets do this  check in there  we got something  virgil you go with this hey shut up  i dont even know what youre talking about shut up i never met you before in my life   did i miss something  yeah he says he knows me  no i do know you youre that guy from the lab the chemist   no shut up stop saying that  everyones gonna know you did this  i dont know what youre talking about  navy seals are trained to hold their breath for three to five minutes underwater  if youre an exnavy seal you probably still have the chops  but theres only one way to find out  oh god what did i do  good for you you broke your cherry     hey you wanna lose a finger put that down put it down  whats the matter  you lose a finger you keep doing

good   lets see if they lead us back to where theyve hidden the antivirals  ow ow watch out im fine im fine watch out thats rusty  here we go dont lose em fi  i know how to tail a car   come on through   well theres no barbed wire  just one guard with a beretta so getting in shouldnt be a problem  why dont we wait for mike and gerard and the guys to leave and well make our move   why not go in now  because mike could get hurt  doesnt sound so bad   whatwhat what is this place   big office supply company uses it for inventory  we got a guy on the inside keeps us off the paperwork  i got building security on the payroll too  arent you uh you know afraid someone might find your stuff  in here good luck everything you needs right up here  oh okay all right thisll do okay  youre gonna have to have power sources clear  cause this thing will suck up a lot ofjuice  okay yeah oh all right good  now listen uh my rig will generate a lot of heat  so you have anything thats yours thats nearby thats pharmaceutical itll fry it  is this yours any of this yours  dont worry about it all our other stuff s scattered around nothing nearby  oh yeah oh good oh good so then then uh  yeah yeah itll work out  i guess ill go out to the van and uh get some tools   give him a hand  okay  fi  hes waving us off  i guess we wont go in then  thats the warehouse he hides the medicine in but its massive   i mean it could be anywhere  so we got to the end zone and no touchdown  you wanna search through 10000 boxes be my guest   sounds like the worlds worst game show  oh sorry about the fridge mike  it was kind of a lastminute thing  hungry  look i gotta do something wheres that warehouse im going down there   maybe theres somebody i can beat it out of  virgil its not gonna work  no we   we gotta get gerard to move the medicine   we do that and we might be able to get it back  you got any ideas  yeah i think its time to bring back the mysterious mr finley  i like where youre going  i just want my money i just want my money can i have my money  can i have my money man i just want my money  what the hells wrong with you  you said this was a simple heist you never said chuck finley

buyer  chuck finleys the buyer oh man  you dont get it he comes in he gets you to bite on a job  he tells you a story he says i deal in everything  i got guns to shoot people up i got medical supplies to patch em up for round two   ive never heard of him  because everyone hes worked with is dead  hes everywhere  if the devil had a name itd be chuck finley  who is he and what do you know about him  he did the same thing to a couple of guys i worked with out west  he used to run black ops for the government  assassinations man stealing secrets  but now he just steals from people like you and me  he takes what he wants and he just leaves a trail of bodies  hes not stealing from anybody we got the warehouse  you dont think he already knows about the warehouse are you kidding me  and if he doesnt hell figure it out one way or another  and notjust this stuff hes gonna take everything hes gonna clean you out  in fact yeah hes hes probably already done that  hesheshes gone id like to go  give me my money ill get on a plane a train anything  youre not going anywhere youre gonna help us move the drugs  no no no i am not going back to that warehouse are you crazy  are you  you tell me      hello police  im on the corner of 29th and first ave  there are these men here with guns i think theyre drug dealers       oh you have patrols in the area already thank goodness   need the police to respond right away call ahead  if youve reported a few minor crimes within a sixblock radius  you can be sure someone will show up when you need them  whats that what are the boxes whats that   antiviral drugs  antiviral i cant be responsible for that  dont worry you wont be theyre already sold  oh my god oh my god hes here thats the guy  thats finley we gotta go   hes one guy  one guy you dont understand  hes not alone he must have guys in that truck we gotta get outta here  youre not going anywhere keep loading the stuff  well take care of finley and his guys     most people think  that shooting the gas tank of a vehicle makes it explode  unless a cars on fire youll just spill a few bucks worth of gas  an explosion requires something extra  like a few bags of acetone peroxide taped to the gas tank     hands in the air get down  dont move  you dont know what this means for us  may i suggest that you fly the medicine next time  what can i do to repay you  you know some guys who can help move a fridge  the cooler doesnt hold much beer mike   your daddy would have been so proud of you    thank you   mike i didnt call her  i know  michael told me what you were doing here in miami  and its a wonderful thing you did virgil   im sorry about before  its okay  you can make it up to me over dinner  take her someplace nice no guns  you got it     you know mike if you had to have a stepdad you could do worse   seymour has our information  he didnt say  just wanted us to stop by his place he sounded more paranoid than normal   you missing a date for this  oh dont flatter yourself  seymour promised to upgrade my laser targeting assist     said i could pick it up tonight should be quick  i have no intention of missing any more dates  you look beautiful fi    so this guy is he nice your date  yeah very hes a paramedic   i think youd like him  yeah i wouldnt count on it       what the hell did you get me into   i was wondering the same thing  who the hell are you huh  why do you keep asking me about that sniper rifle  you start answering questions or your girlfriend gets a bullet in the head  im not his girlfriend   anyone who played soccer  knows theres a long nerve that runs down the shin  hit that nerve and people lock up in pain    arms dealers keep gunpowder handy to manufacture custommade rounds  but gunpowder doesnt need to be in a bullet to be dangerous  even muzzle flare can set it off so when dispersed through a room  anyone with half a brain puts his gun away  no no no no no jackass dont shoot youll blow us all up       seymour you wanna tell me what that was about   dude look  i tracked down a shop that had done some work on the gun youre asking about  the place was burned to the ground man  they killed the guy who owned it i thought you were setting me up for something   who brought the gun in seymour  i dont know  no i swear i swear  all i know is some guy picked up some stuff for it okay   specially calibrated muzzle brakes night sights and a fiber optic camera   thats all i know  whos the guy whats his name  they said his name was billjohnson okay  thats all i know i swear please dont hurt me  fi  we were never here you understand  i got it never saw you    sorry about the dress fi  im not  i got this baby with laser targeting assist  you thinkjohnson has something to do with the people who burned you  have to assume so hes putting a fiber optic camera on a sniper rifle  thats for proof of death wed better find this guy  now weve got his name but he could be anywhere
