                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre black listed  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  its never fun to be the guy  who clears a location for a meet  in the best case you waste your time  looking for dangers that arent there  in the worst case of course you miss something  hey your buddy went in  sam you didnt have to scout this for me  come on mikey i am not gonna let you meet a guy like gilroy without backup  if he was planning on killing me i doubt hed pick such a nice place  do you know how hard it is to get a reservation in there  yeah and i know what they serve in there too   foie gras  lapin  lapin  yeah whatever its still french for bunny rabbit  look im all for bringing gilroy down  but isnt there a way to wrap this guy up  without actually working with him  i went to a lot of trouble to convince him  im as much of a psychopath as he is  might as well hear what he has planned  odds are hes not gonna ask you to walk his dog for him  well i dont have much choice  whatever he is planning the only way to stop it  is to be right in the middle of it  bon appetit  thats french for watch your back amigo  even routine meetings can be risky  if youre sitting down with someone you dont trust  you have to be alert to any subtle clue  that tells you what youre walking into  are they armed did they bring backup  of course there are also notsosubtle clues  glad you could make it i hope you dont mind  i took the liberty of ordering an appetizer to start  like a third place setting at a lunch for two  we expecting someone else  i didnt tell you claude should be here  claude  wonderful chap excellent conversationalist  has great fashion sense  and hes the best thief in the western hemisphere  useful skill in this phase of our little project  i dont mind sharing a meal with him  but uh i prefer to work alone  dont be so hasty michael youll like claude  his rsum is almost as nasty as yours  working with someone you dont know is stupid and dangerous  look whos full of theories  well im afraid youll have to make an exception this time  learn the value of teamwork  no thanks  claude michael  michael claude  so this is your local boy  actually michaels not sure he can stay for lunch  decision time  splendid  lets get some wine shall we to celebrate  something old french and expensive  what exactly is this gilroy job  he wants me to break in to the chilean consulate with claude  get our hands on a file  invading foreign territory and stealing documents  with someone youve never met  sounds great  working with claude is not in the cards  well that i like the sound of are you walking away  no im gonna come up with a way to take claude out  without making gilroy suspicious  you know if he is a thief working internationally  youre thinking we might have mutual acquaintances  ill make some calls michael  but seriously how far are you willing to go  with this gilroy thing  as far as i have to  thats easy to say now but   theres the man i need to see  i come in peace bro  friend of yours michael  you remember sugar  the drug dealer who used to live beneath my place  thats right the man you shot in the leg  yeah your boy capped me through a wall  did something with duct tape  i thought i made it clear  that we should never see each other again  you think i wanted to come back here  i came to hire you man   my cousins in trouble  dont waste your time  look dude i didnt come here emptyhanded all right  in covert ops you get used to seeing old enemies  sometimes theyre looking for intelligence  sometimes theyre looking for revenge  what are you gonna do shoot me again  cause if thats what it takes to get you to help my cousin  go for it  and sometimes theyre looking for a friend  my cousin is messing with shady dudes right now  shady shady like drug dealers  i dont bring my business around dougie i never have  its this jacker named lynch  punkass runs a crew that does big robberies  every time they do a job somebody gets hurt or worse  theyre working an angle on dougie  what makes you say that  theyre not hanging out with him cause they think hes cool  d  dougies slow  i told him to stay away from lynch and his crew  but they keep buying him stuff and taking him to parties  i mean he thinks theyre friends  i talked to lynch mantoman told him to leave dougie alone  i can see that went well  his whole crew jumped me  there wasnt much talking after that  these guys are strapped man  i need a guy like you with the tricks and everything  five grand  im figuring we mount up and ride on these jokers  hows that sound  like a good way to get somebody killed  you dont need a hit man sugar  you need to move your cousin get him off of lynchs radar  you know how long it took dougie to get on his own two feet  hes got his own place now a job  i cant make him start over  im not gonna let lynch do that to him  if you dont want the money fine ill do it myself  im sure dougie would rather start over  than have to bury his cousin  what happened to the badass that used to live here  when he comes back give him my number  youre just gonna let him go  yeah ma are you okay  no im coming right over  its mom its  its important  youre getting the take a bite out of crime award  its for citizen crime fighters  this just happened out of the blue  well i mean you know  that im the neighborhoodwatch captain for my block  and it didnt hurt  that i called in three stolen cars in the last two months  you mean the cars i asked you to call in the ones i stole  theyre giving me a plaque  now im allowed to have one guest at the reception  but you have to dress up  because the chief of police is gonna be there  mom i cant be in a room full of cops  giving you an award for reporting crimes i committed  michael im being honored  do you want me to be the only person there with no family  i mean its not like i can ask nate to fly in from vegas  noon on saturday   hey guys  hi honey  hey maddy you got some sugar  ms reynolds wants to make me some caramelized strawberries   whoohoo  thanks  hey you saw about the award pretty cool huh  sam nominated me  well more like i signed the paperwork  that she already filled out  hey so is fi gonna help you check into claude  shes asking around  good cause i ran his name through some channels  and i got nothing  thanks maddy  ill bring some over later  so  hi fi  so  what  did you get a chance to make any calls  oh you mean about claude i sure did  heard some disturbing things too  i wrote it all down on a piece of paper  but i just cant remember where i put it  im very distracted  i keep thinking about sugar and his cousin  you were there fi i told him what he needed to do  if he doesnt want to listen thats not my problem  what about dougie  are we gonna let sugar  make a bad decision for his cousin too  forget it  claude is former australian sis  real name tomas smalling  which is why sam hit a dead end  you say sugars not your problem  did you ever stop and think  gilroys not your problem either  my man  yeah okay  guns and duct tape when do we go  we dont go ever sugar  you said you would help  i will but my way  so no mounting up no riding on people  okay so hows your way go through the roof  go mission impossible on his ass  that would fall into the riding category so no no  first i check into lynch  see why hes so interested in your cousin  what about me  youre gonna leave town  oh  i ride the pine while you handle this  that punk sent guys looking for me at a club i work out of  i mean i need to answer  yeah thats the kind of thinking we dont need  you want to help your cousin you want me to help  then you will leave town  you will take a trip and you will wait for my call  fine  great now where can i find lynch  whether its a drug compound in the mountains of colombia  or a tropical estate in mami  nothing says success like a lot of land  of course the more land someone has  the easier it is to hide out and do surveillance  lush landscaping may be beautiful  but its hardly secure  i see two on the deck including lynch  let me guess  the one with the pinky ring  hows it going fi  singlelatch sliding window  on the side of the house  getting in shouldnt be a problem once they leave  well lynch and his crew stay plenty busy  theyve hit everything from banks to car washes  how is it they dont get arrested  well lynch is pretty thorough about covering his tracks  they dont leave anybody around to tell the story  that guys a public health hazard  could be game time fi dont forget to plant that bug  a minivan  lynch doesnt strike me as the soccerdad type  well it cant hurt to find out where theyre headed  can you two handle the house while i follow lynch  so were gonna take the bus home  okay fine save gas help the planet  hey im as green as the next guy you know  finding the best place in a house to hide a bug can be tough  but if you cant wire every room for sound  the tv remote is a good allpurpose choice  its got a power source  its kept in areas where people gather  and its usually in the hand  of the most powerful guy in the room  bugs in place sam  look around but make it quick  sam i found something  what are you seeing  looks like lynch h something special planned  something very special  special how do you mean  hes got enough firepower  for a fullscale amphibious assault   machine guns mini oxygen tanks dive watches  maybe hes planning some sort of water heist  either that or he likes to snorkel  get your pictures and get out of there fi  you can often tell when a team of guys  is going out to kill someone  theres something about the way they drive   always below the speed limit always careful at stop signs  theres something about the way they move   a little strut a hard set to the jaw  see it enough times you dont even need clues  like the targets car sitting in the driveway  time to get busy  sugar tell me you left town  no man dont worry dug in at my stash house  nobody knows where it is  lynch knows hes out front  go out back right now  what  oh he wants to go tombstone  fine im strapped to the nines  we can settle this right now  no no sugar theres too many  get out now get out now  no go bro im not letting him run me out of my house  microwaves are one of the most dangerous appliances  in the home to repair or modify but in a pinch  you can use their extremely high voltage to your advantage   did he go down  i dont know i cant see  remove a microwaves surge inhibitor  mix in some reactive household cleaning supplies  and pressurized cans and a fistful of silverware  i think we got him  lets make sure cover  make sure the door is sealed tight  now you want to use duct tape  and to save time just press popcorn  do it right and you have the makings of a very big  sorry bro im staining your leather  you better stay alive  cause im gonna make you clean that later  four shots from assault rifles  and somehow sugar is still breathing  i talked to the doctor  hes touchandgo but if you hadnt been there mike  he would have just been go  police say anything  uh drug dealer gunned down in a stash house  doesnt exactly get you you know frontburner status  the car they were using was torched  so theres no evidence there   we need to get dougie out of town  no  we pull sugars cousin out now  lynch just moves on to a new heist  someone else winds up in his crosshairs  i want this to be his last job  im glad to see you so fired up michael  but is this about taking lynch down or helping dougie  both as long as lynch needs dougie for a job  hes safe until it goes down  well thats great  except we know nothing about this job  well we have some work to do dont we  guys how about this   mike you still have your meeting  with gilroy and claude right  focus on that ill talk to dougie  hes been hanging out with lynch  maybe he heard something  and if we have to move him on short notice  im a familiar face  great  fiona maybe i could borrow your car  the chargers a little stained  gentlemen  i cant stay for long  i just wanted to make sure that our first strategy session  gets off on the right foot  team building is a process  so i thought id help speed it up  matching watches perfectly synchronized  with mine  if you look like a team youll act like one  maybe we should get jerseys  feast your eyes on the thirdfloor window  second from the left  my file arrives in that room on friday evening  on sunday morning its headed for processing  you two will get it saturday  since claude has the expertise in the gettingthings field  he will take the lead  you dont mind do you michael  go team  excellent  did you know that your resting pulse  tends to synchronize with your watch  that means by the end of today our hearts will beat as one  ill leave you both to ponder the possibilities  tata  you just create a diversion cover the alley  i get the file  thats it  you need more  how are you getting in  from the outside not your problem  well it is if you want me to stage an effective diversion  look just make certain no one on the street  is looking down that alley when the time comes  what about the security on the third floor  one guard  if he sees me itll be the last thing he ever sees  usually i get some kind of advance notice  before somebody pays a visit  yeah its weird how that goes  if youre with the independentliving program  what happened to ms lee   who berta  yeah  no no shes county im city  states gonna send somebody in a month or two  then a trijoint panel does their review  its a whole big deal  well dougies a big help around here  we love him youll see  hey dougie  somebody from the program wants to see you  dougie how you doing chuck finley  im fine sir thanks   tell him what you do dougie  okay  i have to make sure that the door to the storage room  is shut real tight before we open the big door  so the bad air doesnt get the flowers  when the cars drive out  and then when the deliveries come in  i have to do the same thing except backwards  sounds like a lot to remember  im good at it mr autry says im vigilant  oh its cold in here isnt it  its good for the flowers  were you in the navy  a  a lot of people in the navy wear those  theyre called luminox  yeah good catch i was in the navy  yeah i tried out to be in the army  but they said i didnt pass the test  my friend mr lynch  hes a marine  he still goes on missions sometimes  he said maybe i could help out on one  thats cool when is it  i dont know im on alert status  did he say what youd be doing  no  he just said to be ready  well mr lynch sounds like a cool friend  you want to meet him hes having a party today  oh that sounds fun dougie but i got a lot of work to do  so you go do your thing  and ill catch up with you in a bit  okay see you later  yeah thanks  fi are you in a partying mood  infiltrating hostile territory is all about blending in  which means if youre a sniper in the bush  you wear a ghillie suit  and if youre a beautiful woman at a miami house party  you wear a slinky dress  retards looking bored watch this  dougie have a little shot with me  cheers pal  its good huh  show us some moves  there it is huh  fantastic  excuse me folks  thank you  enjoy the party  lynch just called a meeting  thats great stay close  looks like its members only  well then you got to join the club fi  we got to get ears on those guys  a bug is only as good as what it hears  so if the discussion you want to be part of  isnt taking place around your listening device  you have two choices  you can move the discussion or you can move the bug  uh excuse me excuse me  this rooms offlimits now  well i  my car keys were in my pocket and i was   yeah yeah yeah yeah your keys   your keys honey we can help you find them later all right   no theyre in here  yeah well help you find them later  if we cant find them  ill give you a ride myself personally all right  call me enjoy the party  i just got off the phone with bolo  he said he found us a thief  who can get us the last piece of hardware we need  sweet how soon can we get it  hes making the intro tomorrow with la covacha  way to go fi  we got the retard  well get the hardware and be good to go  those are some gradea sons of bitches in there  wheres your gun sam  i moved it fi for your own good  look if itll make you feel any better  i think your trick with the bug gave us something we could use  yeah if we can use it to bludgeon lynch to death   ill feel much better  one step at a time fi  lynch is meeting with a thief  good news is hes never seen the guy  i know somebody else hes never seen  youll know bolo when you see him  yeah i figured if hes pimping thieves  he must be a fence so i called barry  he knew him  gave me a description of the guy and his car  and there it is  got the cooperation juice ready  yeah its ready  lets do this doc  bolo right  hey uh somebody left a note for you   a note  yeah its right back here  everyone knows about the placebo effect  people get healed by sugar water  because they think its medicine  you cant just bring it to me  oh its right around the corner here  of course the placebo doesnt just work for medicine   whoa man what the hell  youre gonna want to hold still for this  it turns out fake poisons work pretty well too  which is useful when you need someone terrified enough  to do whatever you say  youve just been injected with 3 ccs of  methyl chlorate benzamide  thats science talk for  you got five hours to live unless you find an antidote  oh my god who are you guys   man what do you   doesnt matter shut up and focus  now youll get the antidote  if and only if you do exactly as say  do you understand   i understand i understand  good  you are going to call whoever youre introducing to lynch  you will tell him to go back home   i am him today  right  try to stay calm  the faster your heart beats  the faster the poison gets into your bloodstream  man im feeling a little uh  a little uh    feverish  yeah  well thats what happens when the chlorate kicks in  your hands will shake  then youll have difficulty controlling your bowels  oh god whyd you do this to me man  youll be fine if you get the antidote  now pull yourself together and make sure lynch likes me  lynch been a long time man how you been  you been good you look good  lets get to the introductions bolo  sure  this is dj the one man who can get you what you need  youre familiar with heavy equipment right  oh yeah he knows heavy equipment like i know hot stones man   lets make a deal  you need to stop talking for a minute  let me talk to dj  cool do your thing man  you know what this is  mm that theres a hydraulic cutterspreader on steroids  some people call it the jaws of life  can you get one for me  are you kidding  dj hotwired aa front loader  and drove it off a live construction site  you think he cant get one of those man  he can get anything you need  wont be easy seeing how only emergencyresponse agencies  are allowed to have that kind  well if i could get it at walmart  i wouldnt need you would i  you sure you cant use the stepdown version  still cuts through metal like butter  just takes a little longer  what are you cutting on  theres a can of tuna im having trouble with  yeah where is this can of tuna do you have a power source  i mean the more details i know the better job i do  you dont get details  you get little pieces of green paper called money  when i get my equipment  you want the gig or not  he wants it  i know a match when i see a match and this is a match  can we shake on this please  its gonna take a few days for your little dream to come true  you get one day  otherwise i find somebody else  oh no no no you cant do that  tell him its a deal  working undercover is all about judgment calls  give the bad guy too little help  and you cant do your job  dj say its a deal  give the bad guy too much help  and you become part of the problem  deal  its a tough call  but sometimes things have to get worse  before they get better  you know i dont like this  we got all these pieces and still no answer  dougies out there flapping in the breeze  and now we have less than a day to pull him in  there has to be a connection to the flower mart  otherwise they wouldnt need dougie  no thing is theres not enough cash there  to justify a major heist  and lynch isnt doing this to steal a dozen roses  well those flowers have to go somewhere  lynch might be using a delivery to get access to a target  makes sense  he uses doug to sneak his crew onto one of the vans  well now youre cooking with gas  you order a bunch of tulips  and you get a fullscale heist to go with it  ill circle back to the flower mart  try and get my hands on the delivery schedule  fi when sam gets that schedule  hes gonna need help scouting locations lynch might hit  consider it covered  oh i got word on your friend claudes preferred mo  i dont know if this helps any  but hes made a habit of scaling  the sides of buildings  free climbing  helps a lot fi thanks  michael your ears must have been burning  i was just calling you  listen about the reception  i was wondering   mom wheres that cityinspector shirt  dad used to wear when he was stealing equipment   you mean borrowing  uh sure  where is it  move  a false wall  im surprised you never found it before  your dad liked to have a place to keep his private stuff  um you should find what you want in there  anyway so i needed a new outfit for saturday  and while i was out i got something for you  you like it  mom  i know its not exactly your style  but it goes great with my skirt  about saturday  somethings kind of come up  so put it back down  i cant its complicated  people could get hurt  well we certainly wouldnt want that to happen  so by all means do what it is you have to do  i bought it on clearance i cant return it  so you might as well keep it  mr autry i know its a pain  but i need your whole delivery schedule  im a little busy right now cant i just fax it later  look im sorry to rush you mr autry  but i got to have it now  i was supposed to turn my report in yesterday  but the supe wont take it without the schedule  all right all right ill be right back  appreciate it   thats a pretty bouquet doug  thanks  mr autry said i could take flowers to my cousin  he got shot  well ill tell you  getting flowers helped me when i got shot  you got shot in action  yeah we were pulling some civilian workers  out of a hot spot in kuwait  i caught a bullet on the way out  after those flowers came  i got better like licketysplit  thats cool i hope these work  mr finley  all our deliveries for the next two weeks  that is great boy have you bailed me out  thanks see you dougie  even the most skilled operative  knows a good plan is 10 execution   advance work is crucial  if you want an operation to be successful  advance work is also crucial  if you want an operation to fail  for example  for someone who likes to break into buildings by free climbing  tampering with potential handholds  could be a very serious problem  fi sam get the schedule  yeah any progress getting the hydraulic cutters lynch wants  im just on my way  jaws of life are standard equipment  for emergencyrescue outfits  if youd rather not take a set that might be needed  you dont steal them from a fire station  a fire training center on the other hand  can probably miss theirs for a few days  without risking anyones life  now who sent you to get our cutters  h q routine maintenance  have them back to you in a few days  a headsup would have been nice  tell you what  why dont you come back on monday   well have them ready for you then  no can do  h qs already breathing down our ass for falling behind  i got you and three other firehouses i got to hit today  i dont know what to tell you  see its my job to get recruits ready to fight fires  i got a class training on those cutters today and tomorrow  so uh you have h q call me  if theyve got a problem with this   what youre using them right now  yeah  shut it off shut it off shut it down   what the hell are you doing  you see those twin lines  one wrong twist and that thing goes snap crackle pop  that thing will start flipping around  like a rattlesnake on pcp  you know what you can do then lieutenant  you take your right hand you wave goodbye to your left  wait wait wait hold on  somebody want to help him load them onto his truck  yeah thats heavy  come on lets go lets go  act like you got some sense here  hey mike  we got the location on lynchs heist  hotel milano  its the only one that fits  theyre hosting an international art auction so theres loot  back of the place lets out onto the miami river  easy water getaway if youve got mini o2 tanks  how do hydraulic cutters fit in  you ever seen those steel crates  they ship priceless paintings in  you couldnt use torches on those  without burning the paintings  im telling you mike its got to be this one  its got to be the hotel milano  best part is flower mart is not delivering till next week   were off the clock  thats right  you get those cutters into lynchs hands tomorrow  well have plenty of time to make sure  hes walking into a bear trap  nice  get it in the van  listen i uh sprinkled a little extra cash in here   since you beat the clock  i aim to please  you ever want to put in some time with a real crew  you give me a call  just might do that  call the retard make sure hes at work  i called him this morning  call him again  fi get sam  whats going on  lynch is on the move we missed something  ive checked they cant be headed to the flower mart  then why would lynch make sure dougies at work  check again sam  theres nothing worse than the feeling you get  when you know youve made a serious tactical mistake  when you thought you had two days to deal with a problem  and you realize you may not even have two hours  oh damn it  how did i miss that  because when you make mistakes like that people die  miss what sam  theres a pickup this afternoon thats listed as anderson  i figured it was a guy named anderson  but its got to be anderson couriers an armored truck  todays friday  so theyre probably doing endoftheweek pickups  this late in the day  that trucks gonna be loaded with cash  we got to get to the flower mart  lynchs heist is going on right now  when you make a mistake in the field  the key is to focus on solutions not regrets  being sorry doesnt mean much in combat situations  you cant apologize to a corpse  theyre gonna hit the armored truck in the loading bay  they needed dougie to let them in  mike they got a guy on the roof  theyre gonna gas the loading bay  its sealed to keep the flowers fresh  theyll kill everyone and then cut open the truck  with the jaws of life  and they use the oxygen tanks to breathe the bastards  how much time do we have  armored truck is due any minute  fi can you make sure that truck leaves in a hurry  sam you take the guy on the roof  ill get dougie out  no no mike he knows me ill get him out  seriously i got it  hey big guy just came by to take a look at the flowers  um the bank truck is supposed to be here in a minute   i got to go get the door  oh thats okay pal  well make sure to stay out of your way  you know the last thing you want to do in miami  is fool with peoples airconditioning  dougie hey hey dougie  you cant be there thats where the trucks come in  no doug i just got to talk to you outside real quick all right  dougie come on  i got to get you out of here right now  dougie what the hells going on  dougie what the hell are you doing   mr lynch what are you  dougie go run  i said get out of here  keep going dougie  go on go go go  get in the car dougie  go  hello  tyler the doors are locked  you got to get us out of here now  sorry tyler cant talk right now  but hey the cops are on their way  and i hope that they can get in there  before your oxygen tanks run out  the gas get the masks get the masks  whoever you are you are dead  do you hear me you are dead  good luck  i dont know how many times i have to get shot  before i start listening to you  hopefully this one did the trick  it was for a good cause anyway  dougies safe  lynch and his crew are going away for a long time  thank you  when we were kids  no one was meaner to dougie than me  i wouldnt even let him hang around me  one day ii ran into some trouble in the neighborhood  i was getting my ass kicked  all of a sudden here comes big dougie backing me up  i asked him why later  you know what he said  i love you raymond  were family  like it was just that simple  a good diversion draws peoples attention  but doesnt make them run for their lives  if youre using a parked vehicle  that means you want smoke and fire  without the risk of an explosion  olive oil starts to smoke at 375 degrees  mix it in the right amount of cheap motor oil  with a low flash point  apply it to the inside of the exhaust pipe  and you should have enough time to walk away  before the fun starts  if anyone comes into the alley   i know shoot them several times   can we get this over with  right  in free climbing  the general rule is always to maintain  at least two points of contact with the surface  challenging climbs always include a point  where the only way to continue is to make a leap  from one point of support to the next  for experienced climbers  its a routine technique with minimal risk   unless of course the handhold youre jumping to  is coated with a siliconbased lubricant  come on we got to get out of here  the department needs more people like you citizens who care  one thing ive learned over the years   no city can be truly safe unless the people  ordinary men and women get involved  cops get the credit but youre the real heroes  well you should meet my son michael  hes always getting involved  maybe someday you can introduce us  oh hed enjoy meet  i thought you couldnt come  yeah i was able to break free  anybody get hurt  is it over now  not yet  you know what  lets get you out of here  what about your award ma  oh they can mail it to me  you can take your tie off now michael thank you  glad you could make lunch after such a busy morning  i heard drinking whiskey before dinner was a sign of weakness  indulge me out of respect for claude  dalmore was his favorite  was his favorite  unfortunately our comrade didnt survive his injuries  he broke his ankle  there were complications  luckily we still have each other  you wanted to work alone bully  the acquisition of those documents  is now solely your responsibility  you know i feel like weve moved on  to a new level of trust  maybe now you can tell me  where this relationship is headed  if claudes failure teaches us anything  its that we must live in the moment  i suggest you honor his memory by completing his mission  consider it  a reason for living as it were  to claude  and to living
