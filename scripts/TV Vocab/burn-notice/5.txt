looked into these guys a little bit for you  thats eli zamar he runs the company  ari and ilan are the sons  elis the one that beat up nate  the name sounds israeli  but jake said they were lebanese  yeahthe business is registered there  they got an office here  and they got a hangar out at the airport  nowthis guy eli  mike i think hes had some training  every time he comes outside he does a perimeter scan  you see that  in gathering intellittle things can tell you a lot  a topflight alarm system  wellplaced cameras without blind spots  paying attention to strangers in the area  uhoh time to go  more aggressive intelligence gathering  is more delicate  but someone who knows what to look for can find out a lot  hey  is this hangar 12  what you looking for  hangar 12 i think  i met this guy at a club  and he told me that he had a private plane  and that he would take me up in it  and ii get here  and its nothing like a regular airport  nothis is a private airport  i meanthis is hangar 12  but its not your friends hangar 12  godwhat a jerk  whats the problem  no problem relax  you have to leave  you guys are workinghuh  you knowbefore i go do you guys have a bathroom  i meani drove all the way out here from south beach  and it looks like i have to go all the way back and  im sorry you have to leave  hey  youre theuhboss  thats right  ii was just looking for a bathroom  no bathroom  out  okay unh godi just need to pee  if you know what to look for a bunch of little things  can tell you everything you need to know  arms dealers great  heavy stufftoo that plane had new engines  it could probably carry a few 50caliber machine guns  maybe even a small tank  probably shipping off to some african war  off limits to legit dealers  youre sure i meanyou saw guns  didnt need to know a gunrunner when i see one  theyre my people  they ship in a special lubricant  and the whole hangar smells like it  mmm there it is  no wonder i got my ass kicked  ohyou were lucky  the old guy had a desert eagle  exmossad  what do you mean like israeli spies  sure  every other retired spook is an arms dealer  not a bad gig if you can stand the exspooks  you should probably call your client  so sowhat do i dohuh  i meaninever saw anything like that there  noof course not  theyre too smart to keep anything around  that would get them busted  listenjakenow that we know what were dealing with  we can try to do something  i should call the police  ii know im gonna get busted  noif you call the police  the only crimes theyll find are yours  and the zamars will know you turned on them  thats not goodjake  take a look at this  this is how your job opened up  the old security manager died in a car accident  all of his brakes just happened to fail at the same time  jesus  i cant believe this  i went to a goddamn basketball game with these people  the seats werent even that good  wellnext time you accept a bribe  id hold out for courtside seats  jakefocus  we need to deal with the problem  im sorry i dont what do i do  cooperate  we need to get them busted with the guns  and they need to go down in a way thats unrelated to you  so it looks like you had nothing to do with it  get them busted with the guns  but where are the guns  thats what were gonna go find out  mikeumtheres something i want to talk to you about  yeahsam what is it  i know youve been pushing hard on this burn notice  trying to get yourself off the blacklist and all  and i understand that  but im getting a lot of pressure  pressure what kind of pressure  wellyou knowthey they want me to give them more  its always morebut the thing is that  yeahsam  ohheythere they go  talk about this later  one cheap and effective security measure  is working in an area with low or no traffic  anyone is a car is too obvious  so you force any wouldbe followers to get out and walk  theyre in there somewhere  ohmikeycome on its 10 square blocks  my cardiovascular fitness isnt what it used to be  you never

life  it could be fate  or it could be that you have a listening device  planted in the airconditioning vent of your car  so there i am in the mountains of afghanistan  and i dont speak a word of the dialect  i got all this training im sent over there  and im stuck with a bunch of guys  from the wrong side of the country  i love it i love it  excuse me excuse me  ah its just my brother so what did you do  well i tried like hell to learn the language  and i ate goat for a month  oh i love it  afghanistan are you serious  thats crazy why were you over here  business this and that  to miami  where the beautiful women are allowed to go outside  youd be surprised how often covert operatives  pose as international men of mystery  fantasies about glamorous covert ops  can be extremely useful to exploit  though some secretagent fantasies  are more useful than others  now that we know each other i have a confession to make  its not a coincidence that we met tonight  i want to talk to you about something about work  i do importexport furniture regional food  import the cigarettes  ari were adults here  the fact is the people in my business know  about your familys operations and we respect it  im listening  we also know that your father does not work  with anyone outside of the family  still your name gets around  we also hear about your brother hes a hardass  yeah hes been calling me all night  hes probably on his way here now  thats why i want to talk to you about an opportunity  what opportunity  why dont you mind your own business  i dont want to cause problems  if youre not allowed to talk about your familys  no no no im allowed to do whatever i want  its just that my father is a little you know  jesus your father again  i dont want to get in the middle of this  god its my brother  ari where you been  i called you three four times  ive been here what do you want  lets go  im having fun now  nice car  im a little tired of it actually  i want to upgrade to the new model  sorry about earlier  my uh family is a little paranoid  comes with the territory  so tell me about the deal  i was in town to do a deal with some plastique  good stuff militarygrade  but the contact fell through  anybody in the arms trade knows  that the mark of a pro is the blow and burn  its a detonator on whatever youre selling  in case the deal goes bad  this is very high grade   you can get commercially  with all the same kick of course  i just need a distributor  you get the buyers  you could double your profits ari  how do i know this is good  oh its very good stuff  you want a little demonstration  please  are we in business  so you gonna go see your new girlfriend debbie  shes not coming no which is good  because i think ari is the jealous type  well i can see why she likes you  you look like a secret agent  listen fi i just need ari to show me  where daddy keeps his guns  we bring in the cops  everyone goes home happy except debbie  well maybe you shouldnt be so hasty  imagine some south beach model hanging on your every word  how many times she call you  five  maybe she wants ari to do the deal  she wants to trade up  admit it   you are tempted  not for a minute fi  if i need a beautiful woman to mess up my life  i could do a lot better than debbie  oh you know your chardonnay  a little  dont be modest  you should come to my place in france  they call it a chteau  but really its just a big house  so about this deal  i think we should start with something small  okay  in addition to the c4 i can get you  militarygrade 50caliber machine guns  50caliber wow  and then we can go bigger  i just need to see your operation  oh no operation no i cant do that  my father would kill me are you kidding me  ari this is about trust  i cant just give you a 50caliber machine gun to sell  without knowing what warehouse its going to  what transport its getting on  i cant its impossible  you know what forget it  im going out on a limb here and you dont trust me  no i get that i understand and thats fine  its just not how i do business  so thank you for your time ill get the check  ah sit sit sit sit sit  i like you i like you  okay meet me tomorrow night  well see  okay are you happy  very happy  i can do the deal and then talk to ilan and dad  you can make a lot of money  okay sounds like hes gonna go for it  just goes to show you  a car is a bad place to have a conversation  mike you know i was gonna tell you  whats that sam  dont treat me like im stupid the bug in your car  i thought we had a deal sam  mike we do i help you out  i tell you what i know  but they know you got something  they wanted me to bust into your place and search it  i told them i wouldnt do it  so they made me plant a bug  and said if i told you theyd be all over us  at least i tried to make it obvious  i mean i practically signed my name on the goddamn thing  oh that you did sam  mikey im with you but this fbi crap  im grinding my teeth at night  its bad for my blood pressure  so break into my place  yeah search it  these fbi guys dont know anything  it might get the attention of someone useful  i got to go  jakes meeting with the zamars tonight  so you should have a couple of hours  i would search in the kitchen area  cabinets sink  behind under dont break anything  all right then  so tomorrow youll do this huh  youll talk to the customs people yes  yeah  is there a problem  nno theres no problem  you need some motivation huh  huh huh  ow  hey  im sick and tired of waiting  i have to be somewhere and this  get up  get up  its me you never answer my calls  wheres ari  hes coming  hes getting bitched out by his dad or something  i wanted to talk to you alone  how long are you in town  arent you and ari engaged  whatever  come on can you have a little fun  youve been around the world  but you never talk about a girlfriend  i want to see  your gun  okay thats not my gun  not my gun  debbie get out of here  now i know your secret you son of a bitch  get in there get in there  ari calm down  i dont know what you think you know  you lied to me  dealing with a blown cover is about stalling for time  stay alive long enough to figure out what they know  and tell a bigger lie to save yourself  you lied to me since day one  what is this secret youre talking about  you wanted debbie huh  you wanted debbie from the beginning  debbie thats what you thought  you were watching me the whole time werent you  you sent her over to test me  you wanted to see how i handled the pressure  oh thats good  oh you are good  so what did i pass  yeah yeah yeah  oh your father trained you well ari  yeah  so i see the operation  yeah yeah okay  riding in a car with a blindfold on  takes some getting used to  the good news is if the drivers busy  making sure you cant see anything  hes not paying attention to whether hes being followed  ill take you to the warehouse but if you screw me  why would i want to screw you  ive got merchandise to sell youve got buyers  its that simple  i just want to know what im getting into  okay  okay security is airtight  the warehouse is not connected to us  we keep the weapons there till we ship  if the cops come they cant arrest anybody  a dead drop  so what if someone tries to steal your merchandise  nobody knows where it is  just the family  out  there now you see the operation  not bad  on the warehouse front  what about security  we have no problems with cops  we have cops on the payroll  they let us know if theres a problem  great m1a 308  nicely balanced  special forces  airport security  we have a guy reliable  yeah  if not we uh  how do they say   we liquidate him  fn p90 with halo sight  state of the art very nice  looks like you have things wired here  so are we gonna do some business  after we send out the shipment well make a deal  you and i we put it together  and then i take the deal to my father  trust me  youre doing him a favor  shall we  you want me to talk to them again  theyll kill me  you see what they did  i thought the plan was to find the guns and call the cops  that plan wont work anymore  theyve got cops on the payroll jake  if you want to get out of this its your best chance  for your family  what do i do  i think its about time  the zamar family learned about aris new friend  any good operative is going to be a bit of a control freak  above all they dont want to hear  that the people they think they own  really belong to someone who can destroy them  look i said i would help you  i got to help your friends now  i cant do this  what are you talking about what friend  steve something he said he worked with ari  he checked out the logs had me show him the airport  he said i belong to him now  what the hell is that supposed to mean   i belong to him  he had my social security number  my passport information  he had all kinds of stuff about you guys too pictures  what are you talking about  i dont know whats happening to me  i want my life back give me my life back shut up  shut up  hey  who is this person  who is he  i dont know okay thats what im saying  he said he was friends with ari  i dont know anything  get out  get out  ari what did you do  ive told you never to talk to anyone  no no this is my deal  i did this on my own  a deal who asked you to do this deal  who is this friend huh  what what he has documents about us pictures  met him at a club he came to me  what does he know did you tell him anything  did you show him anything  i showed him the warehouse  we took a little tour  but but its okay he was blindfolded  he just wanted to see the operation and   ilan go to the warehouse now  come you fool  was that okay  fiona perfect michael trained you well  theyre on their way michael  i am telling you he was the real deal okay  he had the trunk full of c4   stop someones there  its all gone  everything  theres nothing worse  for anyone who spent time in intelligence work  than being up against a ghost  you can deal with an enemy you know  but an enemy you dont know  he could be a competitor  who knows all about your operation  could be law enforcement getting ready to bust you  could be a foreign agent  setting you up in some deep spy game  your only option is to disappear  steve remington  he said he was special forces  try again he could be using a different name  enough ari  lets go  as long as they think steve remington owns you  youre safe  as far as they know theres a mystery man out there  who can destroy them and youre his property  thank you  yeah im not here fishing for thanks  you need to understand the situation  eli will have his ear to the ground forever  if word gets out he got conned youre dead  you guys look so serious  come on its not that hard man  i mean secrets are what keep a family strong right  something like that  im just glad that you guys are finally happy  i got to tell you though when i busted into mikes place  i didnt know if i was gonna find anything  and then i find this document here  in a hideyhole under the sink  i dont know maybe hes as bad as you guys say  we sent this up the ladder sam  this documents
