                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until    we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted     when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit nojob history   youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way   you rely on anyone whos still talking to you     a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fb i  you know spies bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  hey is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere   get your hands on any classified document worth having  chances are its going to be redacted  which makes reading it a lot like watching a movie on an airplane  all thejuicy parts are missing but you still get the basic idea  anything good  hard to tell when you only get every third word  well are you surprised these are the people who burned you michael  youre lucky if you get any information about their operatives  looks like carlas cover in kurdistan was an irrigation consultant  hmm maybe she could set something up to water the ferns in my apartment  when shes not threatening your family or forcing you to run black ops  ill be sure to ask her  cheer up its a start isnt it  yeah and theres a decent chance  shes using a similar cover here in miami   jobs in agriculture are a convenient cover  makes it easy to explain your presence in the field and the boardroom  the only downside is you might have to become an expert on chickpeas  why dont you put that away give it a couple hours  you um  you might see something that you missed  like a tail  lincoln town car up the street  i saw them before we left my place   do you think its them  could be  its gonna be a very interesting conversation if they catch you with that file  can i watch  you drive     you can tell a lot about whos following you by the maneuvers they use  quick evasive driving a casual bailout feigning car trouble  these are signs youre dealing with a professional  smashing into a rickshaw like a crash test dummy  thats a sign youre dealing with an amateur somebody who doesnt know what hes doing   easy easy bro come on its a rental man     thats when youve really got a problem    you sure its safe here  as safe as it can be   you wanna tell me what you were doing nate  well i was following you  i was making sure you werent followed  dont look at me like im crazy all right  the last time i saw you you were being chased by guys with guns  by the way i never got so much as a phone call from you to let me know that things were cool   and i guess you called mom  mom called me  i just figured you wouldnt leave me twisting in the wind in fort lauderdale  after i risked my ass for you  it was just a little unclear at the time whether i should call you  im not here to talk about that   look i got a friend at work whos in trouble  work  yeah i got a job driving for a limo company  a real job an actual job  im friends with the receptionist shes in trouble with some russian mafia guys  theyre holding her sister i was hoping you could help out  whats the angle   theres gotta be an angle  theres always an angle nate  are you trying to get money from her trying to sleep with her  maybe im just changing my life did you think of that  you blew up my truck right  you got me shot at you had me hide mom  thats the kind of thing that gets a guy to step back and make a few changes  and by the way im still paying off that truck   its like 600 a month  200  well 300 but you see what im saying  look would you just talk to her  fine    where is she  moms house   i dont need tea mom  its good its herbal  so youre gonna help right michael  thats what im here to find out   excuse me  uh ma  could you   ma  oh  yeah ill leave the three of you to talk alone  without me  its all right tell him just like you told me   my sister elena  ive tried to bring her to america for years  one day she writes to me says she found someone to take her here  i knew something is wrong is too good to be true  she doesnt think she gives me a name and i go  its this patsan ivan a gangster  he brings people here for money  first he wants 25000 all i have  i go to pick her up this week and now he wants 50000 more  or youll never see your sister again  and if you go to the police hell kill her thats usually how this kind of thing works  howd you get this did he hit you  yes after i attack him with the the bar  you know the metal bar for taking out the nails   you hit him with a crowbar  yes  hes lucky his ohraniki take me away from him hold me away  if they were not there id bite his finger off  katya asked me to help her get a gun  after i heard what her problem was  i figured the best thing for her and her sister would be talking to you  nate says you could help he says you do these things every day  i dont do them every day  but ill see what i can do   here you go  thanks just put that on my friends tab  sure  a crowbar that sounds like a handful   come to think of it i dated a few ukrainians in my day   feisty  fis doing the surveillance  hopefully well track the guy back to where the girls are  before katya gets her hands on a blowtorch     hows it going with the file on carla  pretty good talked to a guy named harvey gunderson  hes the secretary treasurer of the agricultural association of south florida  among other things  so if carla is still using agricultural specialist as a cover  chances are pretty good that hes heard ofher  nice work sam just keep it quiet all right  cant have this getting back to carla  quiets my specialty mike hey whats your budget on this  you know im thinking it should be facetoface with harvey you know  so i can thoroughly debrief him   ill cover it sam  ill try and keep it reasonable   who is she    someone i work with shes gonna tail ivan  hopefully hell lead us to where your sister is  hes there uh that is his van    wow    guys got interesting tattoos  russian prison ink each one means something  really   whats the spade for  it means hes a thief   tiger means enforcer  yeah  huh  what about the skulls what are those for  mike what do the skulls mean   it means murderer nate  murderer  he has my sister why wejust sit here  i wont let anything happen  i promise   cultivating intelligence assets  usually requires some wining and dining  the more connected somebody is  the more they know  the more they feel entitled to a little special treatment   another cocktail  think were ready for a bottle of something dont you  uh im still workin on the scotch thank you  okay a bottle of scotch im kidding   96 uh chteau lafite  excellent choice  i know its an excellent choice i made it  ill pick em you bring em  mmm its a hell of a wine youre gonna love it  so anyway youre thinking of growing hops in turkey is it  yeah outside ankara hey um  so harvey were you able to put together that list of irrigation specialists  you know i need to make a few calls and work some things out  i was thinking you dont wanna waste time going through a bunch of names  i can point you to some topflight people but you know what  maybe you and i can take em to dinner together   so you can get to know em thats all  oh oh great idea  yeah yeah but uh you know i really need that list harvey  just to make sure i got all the bases covered   smart operatives know how to steer the conversation  towards the information they need   you know what you really need sam  hmm   clever assets on the other hand  know how to make the wineanddine phase last as long as possible   the lobster     im serious you ever had the lobster here  no no   swimming off the coast of maine four hours ago  no kidding  which reminds me we should get a bottle of white if were gonna have the seafood  montrachet grand cru unbelievable  its liquid gold   600  what can i say mike  the guy ate like it was his last meal  and the liquor i mean ive had gunshot wounds hurt less than this hangover  you got like a bag of frozen peas or something cold for my head  did you get the list   look hes just trying to drag it out okay  dont worry about it im getting close  well do you think he knows carla  as far as i can tell he knows everyone whos set foot on a farm in the northern hemisphere  howd that thing with ivan go  not as well as i was hoping  i followed him all day  its pretty clear hejust collects the money  stays away from the girls till its over its smart security  if he has no contact with his guys no calls no conversations  then the cops cant make a decent case and we cant find the girls  if were gonna find the girls by friday well need to extract the information  how bout it sam  interrogation well its  its been a while mikey but you know its just like riding a bike  if we can snatch him by this afternoon well have three days to work on him  oh thats cuttin it close maybe if we hit the ground running  make him think hes up against the big boys you know the government types  we dont have a deep bench here  i dont know i think we can do it  fi grabs the guy shes the extraction team  you and me tag team the guy on questions we do the sunglasses the suit the whole bit  make him think hes up against every agency with initials  you think you can bag him alone fi       i like your taste  oh   thank you  im ivan     stun guns are a great way to bring down a larger opponent  the only problem is if you use one on someone whos touching you youll zap yourself too  you brought a toy you want to play  oh i love to play    fi you are one crazy chick      hows our friend ivan behaving  like an altar boy  he even asked me to use the stun gun on him again  he asked you with a gag in his mouth   oh he has expressive eyes  feeling better fi  everyone could use a few thousand volts from time to time   it clears the mind  all righty  i got a pal in organized crime ran down everything he had on this ivan character  whoo hes a hard rock from the motherland  what brings him to these fair shores  they got him linked to what they think is a russian syndicate active on the east coast  pretty much from here to new york  the guy who handles the daytoday operations in miami guy named takarov  but this guy ivan hes seen the inside of every prison from moscow to minsk  so i think the best approach here is we know everything  were rolling up his whole gang and hes just a little fish  well youre the expert sam what else  oh good news  i found the perfect place for our secret facility  its an old concrete plant in the middle of nowhere  they condemned it after the last hurricane this is gonna be fun mike   a lot of peoples first instinct  when they need information out of a captive  is to grab a baseball bat or a gun   this works   yeah ive been in plenty of secret facilities a lot less impressive than this  you get a cooler of drinks some snacks  fis driving ivan to the everglades and back   is that enough time  plenty   the fact is torture is for sadists and thugs  its like getting groceries with a flamethrower  it doesnt work and it makes a mess  getting useful information is about creating a new reality for the interrogation subject  with no hope of escape or freedom  you control every aspect of their world  how they eat where they sleep  even whether its day or night  when its time to ask questions  you want them disoriented anxious wondering who you are and what you can do to them  you have to make them understand that their entire future  their hopes their dreams  every breath they will ever take from then on  it all depends on one thing talking   hello ivan  i want a lawyer now  i know my rights you have to get me a lawyer now  that would be true if i was a cop  who are you cia  ci what no no see theyre only allowed to operate on foreign soil  so just think of me as uncle   uncle sam  do i get a phone call uncle   uncle sam  do i get a phone call uncle  you get whatever you want after i get what i want   what do you want  i wanna get to know you better  i wanna know all about a day in the life of ivan  where do you go what do you do  just think of me as your personal diary  i deliver cheese caviar and sausage to russian markets and restaurants   can i go now uncle  dont waste my time ivan  we know what you do we know who you are  and you sir are just a little fish  you know the difference between big fish and little fish  when big fish get caught they get cooked and eaten  when little fish are caught they get thrown back in the lake to swim away  unless they piss off mr fisherman  im offering you a chance to swim away ivan  its better for both of us really  cause if you dont accept it ooh boy  its a lot of paperwork for me and a dark little room for you  its not so bad  ive been in nightclubs darker than this  maybe i like it here  now look mike  we could send you back in there as good cop bad cop whatever  i dont know what good its gonna do  i mean this guys gulag tough ive seen the type  now after a month when hes been in isolation so long  hes howling at the moon you know maybe  we got three days sam  well thats why i think our best bet might be to have a friend inside  they speak the same language  someone to talk to confide in   the prison buddy  yeah  now look id do it mikey but he knows me already  come on its not gonna be that bad  well set up a cell for the two of you   bring your brother in he can play guard  nate  mike give the kid a break i mean we need a fresh face here  i cant sell ivan on a secret cia compound run by one guy  plus i gotta get back to harvey gunderson and see if he knows carla  im tap dancing as fast as i can  ill call him    so wait a minute you go in the cell with ivan and you make friends with the guy  thats your plan  if he knows what we want he can lie hold out until the girls are gone  we need him to think that im on his side that im safe to talk to  nate these are for you do what sam tells you to do all right  hey i can handle it you just take care of you all right bro   its unfortunate but true that no makeup  can simulate blood and bruises well enough to stand up to close observation  so if your cover requires looking like youve been beaten  you have to get beaten  yeah yeah   ow      nate  what just trying to be a team player    today is your lucky day ivan  got one of your boys in there to keep you company   it can take a lifetime to convince someone to trust you  you two play nice now  its much quicker to make them feel like they need you to trust them   you have the face of a traitor  what   who are you  you talked   you dont know me  i kept quiet  you not a scratch  be careful what you say     a fight is one of the quickest ways   to tell if someone isnt who they say they are    if you say youre russian but fight like an american   you can consider your cover blown    which means youd better know sambo the mixed martial art of russia  of course then you also have to win the fight  a great cover id doesnt help much if youre dead       what did you tell them  i told them nothing   what did you tell them  nothing  i swear it  good  who are you   sergei yoblanovich i work up in tampa    raised in america  youre ivan petrov  hey you run the girls right    who do you think gets your shipment through customs  they shut down the operation in tampa its done  theyre moving down here theyre closing in   how did they find you  i was ambushed by a little suka  they said they know about takarovs headquarters did you tell them   i said i told them nothing  then how do they know these things  they know when your deliveries are they know what kind of vodka takarov drinks  maybe they are watching maybe they have someone in the deli or the caf  i dont know   yeah make sure you stay that way  so if mikes information was right thats probably the place  i mean theres not too many russian restaurants next to a caf across from a deli          ah  hi harvey hows it going bud  yeah oh yeah i got the list  uh gotta tell you i was hoping for more than two names on it though but  oh well im sure theyre the best yeah  uh okay  yeah sure ill ill see you then  another meeting he is working you  ive got nuclear secrets out of kgb agents for less time and money  good thing my liver is flexible because a lesser man would be dead  okay where did we get a thermal camera  oh i borrowed it from my neighbors boat  hes been using it to peek at me  through the walls in my apartment so i figure were even   a thermal camera is a great tool for scouting  itll tell you where the warm bodies are in a building  or which rooms are designed to make those bodies invisible   top floor is heatshielded  oh   mmhmm  hmm    see the guy in the corner thats him  takarov  he runs half the russian mafia in south florida   looks like theres a little business upstairs too  you ready  oh my oh oh man thats horrible  whoa get the manager somebody get the manager   what is problem sir  are you a manager   ll  i didnt think so go get a manager  in fact get the chef  what a joke you call that food look pal get the chef   hes an impostor the freak    oh there he is mr manager i got a big what hello  what ho hey ho i need that     i write letters with that arm   get your hands off me im an american citizen  come now   one issue in dealing with modern criminal gangs  is that their operations are diversified  the heat shielding you hope is hiding a human smuggling operation  oh sorry i was looking for the ladiesroom  could be hiding radio emissions from software pirating computers   uh we call it customer service   you break my arm youre gonna be hearing from my lawyer  hey keep it up ill own this place   take your hands off my father  he has dementia  do you understand cant you see his mind is gone  he doesnt even know what hes saying  come on daddy   daddy  bet you never thought youd hear me call you that  it is days now and all you do is talk  katya were working on it okay  i know its hard but you have to be patient  and my sister how long does she have to be patient   take me to ivan  what do you want katya  do you wanna hit ivan with a wrench or do you want your sister back  cause its gonna be one or the other  and this place romanovs nate says that ivans boss is there why dont we go there  i dont know what nate told you but we have to stick to the plan  my sister doesnt have time for your plans  im going to them now and trade myself for elena  nate you told her about romanovs  its called need to know for a reason   ill take care of it    katya   katya hold up  shes my sister  i know and michaels my brother  and i cant stand that guy sometimes but hes good at what he does  if he says that this is the right thing to do then this is the right thing to do  its gonna be all right  all right  all right just go and talk to him       nate i was just in the hall  and i heard what you said about your brother  that is so sweet  yeah it was wasnt it not that hed do the same for me     a good interrogator  paints a picture of the world outside for a detainee  whatever hes holding on to you take it away  his organization crumbling his friends traitors  his precious information useless  gum  mmm cinnamony  mmm ivan good news  were about to wrap this up   looks like we wont need you much longer  thats why you had me in this hole because you dont need me  hey im doing you a favor im giving you a chance to come clean  you know were moving on romanovs next week  great restaurant try the borscht   look the point is  if you wanna see daylight again youll give me something useful  and hey now would be the time  well i can see youre on the fence  so im gonna give you some time to consider your options  you can wear the thinking bag     and heres some thinking music  oh whoa     is he tenderized yet  uh hes getting there  said he likes nightclubs so i thought i would oblige him  so i figure we let him stew in there for another couple hours  then put him back into the cell with you  hell be nice and loopy and happy to see his old friend sergei  are you off to see harvey gunderson again  mike i underestimated him thats all hes going down  the best of bulgarian disco  yeah well save that for bedtime  itll peel the paint off the walls  wish me luck fellas   working an information source is a delicate art  ideally you can get all the information you need with kind words and free drinks   more wine  you betcha   when drinks and good company arent enough however  a good operative has to apply pressure   mmm  and that means knowing just what a source loves  so um harvey  just wondering about that uh that list   hows that going  great im working on it  got a lot of agricultural experts in miami believe me  im making that list checking it twice  just wanna make sure i dont leave any names off could we get some more crab cakes here   sure sure in just a minute first i wanna ask you something  sure  do you like being secretary treasurer of the agricultural association of south florida  nah im trying to get back to teaching high school  do i like it what are you kidding  what are you talking about i love it  its the largest agronomic trade association east of the mississippi  and im two heartbeats away from the presidency   why  because i think youre jerking me around harvey  i came to you asking for a very simple list of miami agricultural specialists  and you drank my wine and you ate my food and you gave me nothing  you have no idea who youre dealing with here harvey  do you know why im interested in agriculture in central turkey  let me tell you i dont give a rats ass about growing hops okay  i care about opium poppies im with the dea  the  the dea  now one call to my buddies at the department of agriculture  and lets just say they have a little bit of influence over who can be the president  of the board of soil scientists  i mean one day youre the chairman of the miami water resources board  the next day they wont let you in the front door  now ive seen the bad boys of the usda destroy people harvey  and believe me its not pretty  no wait please please dont go sit down  youll have the list tomorrow i swear  make sure i do  mmm liquid gold  oh yeah its the best  they have you for hours and still they dont touch you  they asked me questions then left me in a room with a bag on my head  i guess youre just lucky  do you want to say something say it  every day they have new information  i know  the american he says they moving on romanovs  someone in your organization is talking  they gave us up if they know where the girls are  impossible no one knows where is the safe house but me  ivan if the americans link takarov to the girls  do you think im stupid my men have orders  if anyone but me comes to the safe house they kill the girls and leave  if they dont hear from me by friday same thing  takarov has nothing to worry about from me    the american can ask whatever he wants  by the time they do anything the girls are dead  great so i gotta tell katya that we did all this for nothing   that her sisters gonna be killed  im not gonna let that happen  how huh what are you gonna do use your spy magic  come on ivan has gotta be at the safe house by tomorrow or elenas dead  and he cant be there because weve got him in a box in a concrete plant  hes gonna have to escape  escape are you serious  hes gotta go to the girls himself   hes not gonna buy it if we just let him go  thats crazy man i mean  have you got a better idea nate because we dont have a lot of time here  you asked for my help you want it or not  if you want my help we gotta go to the concrete plant and do this  if you dont tell katya to get ready for her sisters funeral    okay  ill get my suit   michael your brother is trying  ma  please you sent him off to fort lauderdale and left him there for weeks  i mean what is that some sort of covert operations thing  or is it just a lousy way to treat your brother  ma ive been living in a storage container for two days maybe we can call it even  michael it isnt just about what you do its about what you say too  he cares what you think more than you know  do you know what his first word was   it was michael  it was juice  i was there his first word was juice  well he was looking right at you when he said it you know what he meant   you were his hero  ma i just dont wanna get into this right now  michael please look i know that nate has had his problems  but you know when it all first started  i mean when he first got into really serious trouble  it was right after you left  give him a chance  what what is wrong with you you cant stand still  you heard them this is almost over  and when theyre done with us theyre gonna throw us in some cia hellhole  for the rest of our lives  if by some miracle they let us go were gonna be dead anyway  dead what are you talking about  what will takarov think  he will hold us responsible  we will speak for each other i will tell him you were strong   you kept your mouth shut  before he cuts your throat or after  no no no we need to get out of here  listen if we can get to the girls maybe grab em move em  show takarov that that we fought  escape you are dreaming  can i trust you    yes  they showed me a file with surveillance photos takarov  i swore i didnt know him they beat me but i got this  i can open the handcuffs we can overpower the guard  maybe wed get out maybe wed die   but if we dont get out we die anyway are you with me  then what   we dont even know whats on the outside of that door  oh i heard em talking  its not a real jail its temporary   theyre gonna move us into a real prison     you have to decide now now    theyll handcuff you to the wall you keep em busy  you distract em ill take care of the lock you under    sergei    yeah i understand   all right lets go    feel a little more talkative now   you really think you can do this to us  shut up  we have people everywhere  doesnt matter who you are cia fb i  we can find you and kill you just the same  hey you ever wanna see the light of day again shut your face  lets go   one of the hardest things to do in a fight  is to make it look like youre trying to kill someone without doing permanent damage  they dont teach any halfmoves in combat training  there are moves designed to kill and maim as efficiently as possible    if those are offlimits one option is opening your fist right before a punch lands  painful but the force is distributed  another showy option is a kick to the shoulder  it might break a rib or two  but if you aim right nobodys going to the morgue           put it down   i said drop it     dont dont kill me no please      lets go   where is the other one  back there   i heard him begging  after the beatings he gave me he deserves to die more slowly  we have to go to romanovs  what show up at takarovs emptyhanded  no we gotta show em we thought of the organization first  where are the girls  ivan we dont have time for this where are the girls  theyre in hialeah i will show you   this is it  yes  you think theyve been here does anything look different  its fine see the van means the girls are still here   where have you been  ill tell you later we need to move the girls now   what who is he  this is sergei hes all right  now move go       we have to get them out of here  do you have a place  yes there is another safe house that takarov uses for guns  how do you know the cia isnt already there   we cant use anyplace they might know about  then where can we take them  i got a place down by the docks no one knows about it but me  youre sure its safe  youre right i should bring some of your guys take some guns along just in case  you go to takarovs you tell them they might be moving on romanovs   who knows we might come out heroes  all right   da  sergei   i dont forget this  im sure you wont ivan       theres been a change of plans     its all over drop the gun     in the spy game you spend a lot of time  getting people to betray their own  most do it for money some do it for spite  but the greatest achievement is to get a guy to turn on his own people  because he thinks hes being loyal   you have to get out  what what are you talking about  they busted the operation in tampa theyre coming here next   they had me and sergei but we escaped  what operation in tampa  we never had an operation in tampa   but but sergei  whos sergei  he took the girls he said he worked for you in tampa  it was the cia they had us  you talked to the cia  you gave the girls to this sergei  and then you come here  take him upstairs now    sam talked to a police buddy of his  sounds like takarov was worried enough to skip town with most of his crew  apparently he headed north because they found ivans body  in a dumpster in fort lauderdale  dumpster is too good for him  what my sister means say is thank you   yeah     how is your pain  breathings a little difficult  mike cracked three of my ribs  but you know it was a small price to pay  im sorry i was angry  nate said you know what to do always you are right  this nate nate said that  you wanted me to keep her at moms  i just said what i had to say  thank nate katya  i couldnt have done it without him and im not always right    1350 and all sam got on carla was a po box  more than i had fi  besides i dont think he could have survived any more intelligence gathering  well sams liver can take a vacation while we   what do we do now  now we watch  someones gotta pick up the mail sometime   i hate surveillance     intelligence gathering isnt all running around with a gun  and a spy camera  when the operation demands it you get to sit in a hot car with no airconditioning  in downtown miami
