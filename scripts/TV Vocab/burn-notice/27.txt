then one dayit was just over never knew why  he just said goodbyeanduhhe was gone  yeahthat soundslike michael  from private homes to financial institutions to military encampments  security consulting is a multibilliondollar industry  and while security consultants constantly tout new materials and technology  the basic techniques havent changed in 4000 years   get a better view of any danger headed your waymake your walls sturdier  and arm yourself well enough to fend off attacks  hardening a target against attacks from outside is pretty straightforward  which is why its usually best to attack from inside if you can  darlingare you readyto watch me become rich  im gonna relish this  ohwhat the hell this is not good  if that plane doesnt cometo uswe got to go to it  what if the buyers show   we improvise were gonna need a car  sam  yeahthats far enough  you cant be serious youre not gonna leave the planeout in the open like this  its not that i dont appreciateall your work on the hangar  i just liketo change things up  brennenyou dont understand  noyou dont understand  either your security workedand it scared samantha away  in which casei dont need it   or it didntscare her awayshes ready for itand i dont want it  holaamigos  cmo est  now what  come on do you see what did i tell you  how did they getinto the airport  i locked down the hangar  i didnt lock down the airport  i thoughti almost missed my ride  you said samanthawas gonna try to steal the chip  did that looklike a robbery to you  jesusyoure supposed to be smart  the only way outfor samantha was to steal the chipand put it back  when she couldnt do thatshe knew theyd find her  soshe didthe next best thing  she took you downwith her  you wanted to buy a mansionand a private army in somenonextradition country  if im not mistakenyour money just leftwith your buyer  good luckfinding a new one  fbiciansa theyll all be on high alert  and after thatin less than 24 hours  you used to workwith samantha  you said you were betterthan she was thats what you told meright  i am  you can put the chipback at afcand nobody will noticeits gone  how stupiddo you think i am  this is what you want thisright here  you get the chip i have to give it to you i have no choice  this is what you want am i right  yeahyoure right youve got no choice  youre either gonna be killed or serving a life sentenceby the end of the week  unless the chip goes back  it doesnt matterwhat you believebrennen  theres one movefor all of us  put the chip back  and unless you know somebodyelse who can do that  if you try tosell the chipif you dont put it backi will find you  and no clever story youregonna tell  is gonna stop me from blowing your brainsout of the back of your skull  do we understandeach other  welcome to afc industries  we manufacture satelliteand missiletracking systemswe design uavguidance chips  and sometimeswe accidentally hire thieves  thats the clean room thats where the chip has to go  the engineer that built itcomes back tomorrow  hes got a presentationon the chip at 300  wellthenthats our deadline  we put it backbrennens on the run from his nastysouth american friends  and were good to goso long aswe dont hit any snags  show me the snags  card reader up front  nowassuming they haventupdated their employee filesi can get us through  well dummy up an id that says you work with me  handprint reader here  yeah yeahbut thats not the problem  the problem isthe cleanroom door  its got a keypadthat has a  took me 45 minutes to hack itin the middle of the night  today we wont have 5  i meantheres no way we can get out cleanin that kind of time  then i guess well justhave to get out dirty  no large security building is designed to be 100 secure  doing business requires flexibility to deal with visitorsrepairmancontractorset cetera  getting inthenrequires using that flexibility  i need your ids  hes got a temporary pass ill sign him in  and would you mind calling downand just letting them know that were gonna be by to set him up as a vendor  yeahno problem  can you get me a raisewhile youre at it  you have to make everybody think youre someone elses problem  even advanced security measures are useless when people leave their keys lying around  and surprisingly oftenthats what people do  people leave their key cards in pursestheir passwords on desks  and their handprints on soda cans  oohyou want some he left a little  im fine   diet mountain dew  we dont have much time  shall we donour bunny suits  you knowif youre shywe can break into the ladieschanging room just up the hall  ohwe can do this  past a certain point in a clearance facilityyou stop seeing security cameras  lowly security guards dont have the clearance to see whats on the cameras  so theres no one to monitor them  usuallyin the top security areas of a hightech facility  its less about monitoring and more about fortification  and here we are  sotell memichaelwhat exactlydo we have planned here  its a shape charge  the det cord explodes  and the reinforced polyester from the hose shapes the blastand  youll see  wellits nice to seeyouve learned some new tricks since the last timei saw you  i would stand back  in a highsecurity situationmost people try to create the smallest disturbance they can  the thing ishigh security is built to deal with small disturbances  trip one sensorand youre toast  trip 100 sensorsthoughand nobody knows what to do  these look expensive  what what are you doing  its got to look likewe broke in for a reason  were trying toget everyone out of here in an orderly fashion  please have your bags readyfor inspection  you really thinktheyre gonna buy that someone wentthrough all this trouble just for some lenses  i dont think theyre going toknow what to make of this  nothing majors missing  hopefullytheyll double the securitykeep people like you out  speaking of that the bag   the bag what do you want to see my bag for  samantha  its justsome platinum wire its worthlikewhat8 grand  its done  sounds like you invited the miamidadessheriffs office  not exactlywhat i had in mind  but its exactlywhat you needed  one dayim gonna figure out exactly what gameyou were playing here  no gamebrennen  id focus less on methan getting out of the country  your buyers looked pretty upsetwith you  your concern for my welfareis much appreciated  see you aroundmichael  i love you bye  charlie says hi  he wants to knowwhen im coming to get him  you leave town today  and you need to stayout of townsam  brennen wont forget this  he doesnt knowwhat to think right nowbut if he were ever to confirmthat we were working together  wellhe wouldnt take it well  and you needto give up this life  you got lucky this time
