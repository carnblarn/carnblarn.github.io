                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you   a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  there are advantages to training with someone youre close to  knowing each others moves makes training more effective  but being involved in each others personal lives  can also make training a lot more painful   something you want to talk about fi  not really  i know youre not thrilled  about me reaching out to the intelligence community  no i dont have a problem with it  you want your old job back i said id be supportive  not a problem  are you expecting company  thats like two days worth of yogurt  that is either a brilliantly disguised bomb  or somebody knows the way to your heart  and theyre shy they didnt stick around  a thankyou gift from a client  well thats the most youve ever been paid for a job  pretty soon youll be able to stop bumming money from me  its a gift from your agency friends isnt it  could be  good for you  looks like youre getting back in  yogurt   meeting a new operative is a lot like going on a blind date  youre bound to be nervous the first couple of times you do it  but live through a few and you get to be an expert  you should arrive early prepare an exit strategy  and know you could be in for an ugly surprise  i figured youd run surveillance from the bistro cause of the sight lines  but youre the spy right this place is better  better escape routes better iced tea   so michael you like the yogurt  no i havent tried it yet  i was always taught never take yogurt from strangers  well lets not be strangers then  names tom strickler  and what is it that you do tom  match people with opportunities its a bit like an agent  a man with your skills is extremely valuable as im sure youre aware  and i just make sure all that doesnt go to waste  youre operating in miami  with no resources no operational support  thats no way to live  its not safe for you or the people you care about   and youre the solution to that  yeah im not asking you to change  you get to keep doing what comes naturally   and what is that  surviving  youre great at surviving  now youre a man with enemies we know that  but your enemies have enemies of their own  people thatll pay to have you take care of their problems  called synergy  the enemy of your enemy is your financial opportunity   whats in it for you  10  im putting together a deal for you now actually  i heard a rumor about  an old associate of yours whos making a move to miami  figure the smart moneys on michael westen in that fight  and youre the smart money   any details on this old associate  still working on that  apparently theres some ukrainian  whos very upset about an op you ran in the 90s  ill let you know more as i get the details   sorry im not a killer for hire  lets not get ahead of ourselves  this might be a killing thing it might not  let me do my homework and well discuss  theres nothing to discuss  well the thing is this guys coming one way or another  you have my number well talk soon  unless the ukrainian cuts your tongue out first right  so whos the secret admirer  whoever they are they have good taste in yogurt  his names strickler  he says someone i crossed paths with in the ukraine is in town  looking to settle an old score  and hes here to profit from any bloodshed  charming whos the ukrainian  strickler claims not to know which is inconvenient  because theres people from that region who would like to see me stop breathing  i know a guy goes by beck he might be able to help  hes made a lot of money for some very powerful people over there  if hes ukrainian hell be able to fill you in  based in miami  started as a local gangster and went bigtime  he hijacks cargo and ships it  like fedex with a kalashnikov set  hes about as connected as a hustler who doesnt speak russian can get  think you can get me a meeting  you dont want me as gobetween  i may have intercepted a couple of his shipments once  sparkly new p90s michael  they deserved a good home  so i get to walk up to him cold great  at least youll get a good coffee i know his favorite spot  yeah sam  yeah mike im at your moms  she got some curtains from a guy named tom strickler  is this a business associate of yours  put it this way you know that broker that contacted you in germany in 89  yeah mueller  tried to pay me to accidentally blow up a factory during an operation   bloodsucker  i have my own parasite  some ukrainians in town looking for me  if i can get to him before he does  strickler cuts you a check and youre one step closer to being a mercenary   what are you gonna do  run down the ukrainian  through a contact of fis  sam can you  check out strickler im on it  no one else gave me a houserewarming present  not even the guy who blew up my house  maddy i thought we were over that  forgiveness is a process  pick me up some curtain rods and maybe  fine curtain rods you got it  the cold approach is something you try to avoid in intelligence work  you want to ease into a relationship over time  when thats impossible  you just have to turn on the charm and hope for the best  john beck right  name is michael  i heard that you might be able to help me with a situation   word is youre a guy with connections  thats what they say   i just need a little information  why should i give it to you  im a good friend to have  let me explain something to you i dont have friends im a businessman  i got rivals i got associates i even got a few enemies  but friends  sorry thats not how i roll  i just need help tracking down a ukrainian  who might be in town looking for me   sounds like youre in a bind  could be   thats what im trying to find out  good luck not my problem  a while ago one of your shipments of p90s was diverted  i can make sure that kind of thing stops  see i dont like people in my business  this here friendship has gotten off to a bad start  friendships are about give and take  you give me the information ill take care of your shipment issues  how about i give you one more chance to get out of here  before i shoot you in the face  that ukrainian i mentioned  he brought a few extra guys into town with him id get down  a flashbang grenade temporarily impairs hearing and vision  id get down  it makes fighting back or attempting escape  futile and dangerous to civilians  so if you have to shoot blind its better to use a camera than a gun  that was a short meeting        in a hostage situation the same things that get you killed  will extend your life  look i dont know who you guys are okay  i got no problem with you i guarantee that you dont want no problems from me  or the people that i work with  so lets cut this thing off right here  no harm no foul everybody goes home and we just forget all about it  if you have money youll live till you pay  if you have information youll live till you talk  come on look you got the wrong guy im not a part of this  i just met him for the first time five minutes ago  what do you think theyre gonna do  drop you off at starbucks give you a couple of bucks for a cup of coffee  shut up well figure it out  come on im serious you got the wrong guy  and if you have nothing youre pretty much disposable            excuse me we need to keep this area clear  well you know i was in here  and i ran out when those men showed up  and my husband hes still in here  go ahead  sam im at the caf where michael was meeting beck   whats wrong  hes gone so is beck  an extraction team  professionals from what im overhearing  jesus you think mikeys ukrainian made his move already  well he moved quicker than anyone expected  wait a second  michaels cell  he took a picture of the team  you know what we gotta find strickler maybe he can put names to these faces   i dont trust that guy  yeah well hes all we got  plus itll give us a chance to kick his teeth in  im wearing my teethkicking heels see you in five  there is something wrong  not at all why would you think that  so why you packing your gun and your bulletproof vest  nothing to worry about i just gotta run an errand  really  so tell me about this errand      after the adrenaline rush of an operation comes a crash  heightened reflexes and awareness dont last  two boring hours of driving later  even the sharpest killing machine lets down his guard  you dont wanna meet this guy chechik  when its time get to the back door and open it  what are you doing  just remember  set your jaw  you traitor you son of a  are you thinking of selling me out to chechik  i will kill you   youve to head into the trees  i got nothing to do with this  i dont even know him  what do you want an apology lets go  look maddy how many times do we have to go over this  were doing a little practice thing mike is fine i swear  youre gonna hear some swearing if you dont tell the truth  sam what is taking you so long  theres fiona she never shows up when theres trouble  im telling you theres no trouble  fis just here to pick me up for  a movie  really  well im in the mood for a matinee should i bring a gun  dont you patronize me  i have a right to know whats happening with my son  did i fall apart the last time you told me what was going on  someone took michael   they took him where  thats what we need to find  the second you find out anything i expect you to call me  let me remind you youre staying in my guest room  you call me or god as my witness i will smother you in your sleep  all right all right well call  wait wait stop right now  we dont have time for this you wanna shoot me  youll have the same problem just with one less bullet  maybe ill drag your ass back to that road as a peace offering   i deal with russians  you speak the language   i got guys for that  you better learn fast  chechik didnt hire ambassadors  theyre not gonna wait for a translator before they start shooting  ill put a bullet in our head   that dont require translation  listen beck i got you into this i will get you out   if we head east  you wanna go deeper into the woods  we got enough problems without adding alligators to the list  you go whatever way you want  im going  im going this way  beck save your ammo  few days wandering around here starving youre gonna want to eat that bullet  if you wanna survive beck follow me  you missed a spot  youre michaels friends   where is he  want a mojito  dont look so concerned sweetheart  our favorite spy is in a bit of a jam and youre hoping i can get him out  i wish it was that simple i was the one telling him  to keep his head down till i find out more about who was after him  and   ive some calls out  youve got some calls out  i suggest you try harder  no need for theatrics  i want michael alive as much as the next guy  unless of course the next guys ukrainian  you know him  michael took this picture before he was snatched  i know that pretty boy his names blad  byrubin balubin b something  last time i checked hes part of a criminal syndicate run by pyotr chechik  chechik  that rings a bell  mikey met him back in97 when he blew up a  lets just say that he really hates mikey  where is chechik  well guys with records like him dont cross borders too easily  if he is in miami he didnt fly commercial  i know some of the pilots that do the miamieastern europe route  could put out some feelers give me a couple of hours  im not giving you a couple minutes i want names now  when on the run subtle things like broken branches flattened grass   and disturbed ground can give you away to an expert tracker  an inexperienced tracker may require a more obvious trail  what is this you trying to get us killed  followed  we need to lead them deeper in turn their strengths to weaknesses  their bulletproof vests  their guns will get heavy  we got to get them farther  whatever you got planned theyre far enough    listen  you listen  i grew up in the florida backwoods i spent my life trying to get out  i fought my way down to miami so id never have to swat bugs  in another mangrove swamp and now you dragged me back  i say we make our stand right here  you want to make a stand  can we make the stand over there  still think you can take them theres five of them   i got five rounds  thats your plan  youve a 100 kill rate   its better than running around in a swamp  i aint too bad with a gun ill  teach you   you fire theyll get our position theyll flank us and pin us down  we have to separate them  we got to lead them little farther in   and then we strike  and then we strike  looks like the guy strickler said flew chechik into the country  why anyone would allow him to pilot a plane is beyond me  great a drunk with a gun   this calls for subtlety  i can do subtle  i dont like to  but i can  what is a sweet little girl like you doing in a big bad bar like this  im looking for a big  bad man  like you  come with me or say goodbye to your two closest friends  give me your shoelaces  i may not be rambo but if youre making a trap  it doesnt have to work theyll see it and figure were close  theyll fan out well injure them   were injuring them  itll slow them down  if i have to drag a complaing pain in the ass through the woods   they can too give me your shoelaces  you know what  maybe its time we listen to the guy with a gun for a while  fine  now give me your shoelaces  mr smartass  all right lets try this again give me your shoelaces  please  yeah maddy you wanted me to call so im calling  you find michael  no but we found some guy who might be able to tell us where he is  were leaving hallandale right now  were heading over to the loft to ask him questions  you bring him here instead  its closer than michaels loft and you dont have time to waste  fanning out in a search pattern is a great way to cover a lot of area   but it also divides your forces   stand back  dont we need him alive remember  you wanna hit him  anytime  military units are a lot like marching bands  take out the guy conducting the operation  and youll throw everyone out of sync  pretty soon all you have left is sound and fury  we got two guns explosives a serious knife  we could even the odds real quick  not until they call chechik we need to lure him out here  what  if we get chechik we can end this   you want more men out here  when you started out who was the biggest hijacker in miami   cuban guy montez  how did you take him down  well i paid one of his guys to let me into his place  and then i stuck a gun in his mouth until he decided to move back to la  you dealt with the problem at the top thats what were doing   if they dont call chechik  they will  theyre in over their heads and they know it  see  dont get cocky  youve been running up frequentflier miles with a lot of shady characters  i wonder what the feds would think  i told you man all i do is fly the plane  i doubt the boys in suits would see it that way  chechik is a bad guy war crimes murder for hire  why do you think im keeping my mouth shut  that guy is more afraid of chechik than he is of us   we have to squeeze him harder  if by squeeze you mean choke   he cant talk if he cant breathe  he can whisper ive good hearing  you push him too hard hes gonna snap  and then hes gonna start making crap up  sam axe wisdom  how you doing  you comfortable you need anything  mind if i sit  you want a cigarette  mind if i do  i dont mean to bother you i need a peace and quiet  they get loud when theyre angry  luckily this place is wellinsulated  you cant even hear a peep from outside  probably why they like it so much  im sorry i hope i didnt give you the wrong impression  i have never once ever ever seen them make anyone suffer  if they dont think youll break they end it quick  you sure you dont want a cigarette  its good for the nerves  its not like youve to worry about getting cancer anymore  im sorry did i hurt you  there you go  good huh   i dont micromanage you  im not micromanaging you either  he dropped them off a few hours ago a cabin in the middle of the swamp  theres no address but i got the latitude and longitude  how  honey ive met guys like this before theyre brave when people are yelling  so you gonna go get my son or do i have to do that too  when fighting in the wilderness  the biggest threats are often the ones you dont see  dehydration  exhaustion and nerves  but boatloads of hostiles dont help either   theres chechik  damn  is there a russian word for hardass  if we can get him into the woods well have enough cover to separate him  you sound confident for a guy hiding in a jungle with a pair of slacks  we wanted chechik there he is  yeah along with more men more guns and damn airboats man  we go we take out chechik and all those guys will come after us  the men who work for you if you were taken out what would they do   shoot the bastards who did it  really you really think so  you said you had no friends  all right think like a businessman how long would they stomp in this swamp  once the guy who cuts their checks is out of commission   how you doing  yeah how you doing  whatll it take to rent one of these babies for a couple hours   25 for basic coverage 15 for supplemental liability  does that cover smallarms fire  what my friend here is saying is  were not big on paperwork  you guys werent even here  look we just disappeared  thanks                thats chechik some things never change    so we get him when he goes into the woods huh   only he aint going into the woods  weve to get him to move point is  no the point is that you wanted them to call for backup and they did  now were outnumbered five to one  in battle not even the bestlaid plans survive contact with the enemy  if you want to survive you have to be willing to improvise   all right if you distract his men  wait wait wait  distract a dozen guys with guns forget it you and me are done  id rather take my chances with mr hardass  beck stop  youre gonna get killed  so what you gonna do shoot me give away your position  of course theres such a thing as too much improvisation  its like you said im a businessman  i got something they want now its time to negotiate  i wanna make a deal  you want westen i can give you westen  get up    you think you can reach that bank underwater  guess i have to      you know i should have shot you when you first interrupted my coffee  lets not dwell on missed opportunities  you know  i got 25 people on my payroll  i got people who report to people who report to people  and here i am in the middle of nowhere about to die from a damn leg wound  well youre not alone  the hell im not   you gonna stick around watch me die  no were gonna get through this  what what are you crazy  youve seen what happens to people with wounds here  look it doesnt have to be that way  but you have to decide  are you ready to trust me and figure out a plan or do you want to die out here  is it really that tough of a call  delaying tactics arent the most glamorous part of a battle plan  but theyre often the most important  slowing the enemy down buys you time to prepare the ground ahead of you  and that more than almost anything else wins battles  where is your friend  i got nothing to say  where is michael  why should i tell you youre gonna kill me anyway  maybe maybe not  youre nobody  im here for westen  you tell me where he is  and ill give you some water and bandages for the wound  you see this  i swear on the cross  on the eyes of my children  all right fine  he went that way theres a swamp  where the airboats cant go          the pilot dropped chechik a few miles up  if michaels not there i hope you brought bug spray  right there  that must be chechiks airboat they got to be close  for a spy theres no shame in retreat  when faced with a more powerful enemy  youre trained to get out of the way and keep moving  its not about running away or giving up  the goal of any retreat is to find the right place  to marshal your resources and make a stand  military history is filled with stories of small forces taking on larger ones  whether its david fighting goliath  or the french resistance fighting the nazis  the strategy is basically the same  you have to choose the right ground  deploy your resources carefully  and remember that the greatest weapon in any battle is surprise  give me the radio  well well michael  here we are again  after so many years  you me plenty of guns  i almost forgot how much i enjoyed the hunt  you know i thought after serving  you would have found a new hobby  want to find you more  i never get over the one that got away  im flattered  you brought a whole army just to find little old me  times change  an army that big i got to fold my laundry  i work for fedor markov now  markov  you know i liked you kgb officers better  before you sold out  at least you believed in something  you should be happy michael  we all live american dream dream spies like you helped make  open borders free markets everyones friends  look at me ukrainian with russian team  german weapons funding from the west  so many backgrounds so many people working together just to drag  every secret out of michael westens head  before we cut it off and feed it to the dogs  but enough talk  as much as id like to catch up  you should have turned your radio off      you should stick to hunting things that dont fight back  get your men to drop their guns do it now  all right      nothing you have to worry about anymore  get up   thanks man  easypeasy huh  i expect some serious memory loss you understand  you think this is over  shevchenkos look out for their own markov will find you  dont you know its rude to drop names  yeah stupid too  especially when a nobody like me can drop bigger ones  all those kgb colonels in the russian mafia  well they work for an old kgb general  who happens to be a business associate of mine  i dont want to name names  but he can controls about 800 miles of the siberian oil pipeline  yeah i do all their importexport work  you nearly cost them a lot of money  im gonna have to give them a call see how they feel about that  i give you 50000 and i swear youll never see me again   i know i wont  get this fool out of here  stop 100000  dont be stupid come on  theres not enough money in the world  next time you get kidnapped can you stay out of the everglades  there aint gonna be no next time at least not for these boys  and you still owe me a shipment of p90s dont think i forgot  ill make sure they get to you  you know one day were gonna look back on this as a nice day out in nature  yeah dont push it  ill just say this  you said you were a good friend to have  could do worse  what brings you two out to this neck of the woods  well you know its such a sunny day  i thought you might need these  im beginning to think i should get you one of those harness things  you know like they have for toddlers  youve been wandering off a little too much these days  its nothing i cant handle mom  no see you dont get to act that casual  when im interrogating strange men in my garage to save your life  im sorry about that mom  whatever  getting answers out of him was a lot easier than getting them out of you  be careful  do you like my new curtains  you hung your curtains by yourself  actually no some very nice people came over and did it  they were sent over by your friend strickler  wonderful  try not to wrinkle them when youre sweeping them for bugs  no gift basket  so nice to have you back in town  no no gift basket i got you something better  your share of the ukrainian deal  turns out a group of baltic separatists wanted chechik out of the picture  just as much as you did  some quick negotiating on my part and voila  your daytrip to the swamp paid for itself  i didnt fight off chechik for the cash  i know you did it for you  this is just a wonderful byproduct  this is just the beginning i can get you whatever you want  let me save you some time im never gonna work with you  not for the money not for the yogurt for the curtains  im not a mercenary  but you gotta ask yourself this  what is it that you want what is it that you deserve  a man with your skills with your background  burned out in the cold with nothing  dont answer right now  think about it  ill be around
