                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  previously on burn notice  i dont know why youre willing to meet this gilroy  he sounds as bad as the people who burned you  hes worse  this man is a freelance psychopath  westen  i have to say i find you quite fascinating  you and i have a lot in common  what do you say we work together  tempting  the gist is this  youre to steal flight data for every private plane  flying in and out of miami for the next six weeks  what are you doing  im offering you a job  you do it you get paid money  thats all you need to know  this is another moment of truth michael  do we have a future together or not  double my fee  fair enough  i may lose my seat at the table  if i dont come up with six weeks worth of private flight records  i was thinking the coast guard  thats a good choice  this is every flight today  every day is exactly like that except one day  the 22nd  somebody needs a wide berth  this is some kind of serious black flight mike  originating in chile  fuel stop in miami destination poland  this is what gilroy is interested in  youre a tad overdressed for the jacuzzi dont you think  is this your card  its blatantly not six weeks of flight plans  just the one that you want i need to know whats going to poland  well i suppose its only natural to be curious  its a weaponized plague and a vaccine to match  and theyre worth a bloody lot of money  that wasnt so hard was it  youre in then  gilroy i think you and i have a bright future together  so learn anything  only that hes a damn good liar  when you need to locate a foreign spy office  its all about the food  spies like home cooking just like everyone else  find out who serves their original delicacies  tip the bartenders and delivery boys well  and theyll usually tell you who  placed the big orders on the last national holiday  if some of these orders head to an office with tight security  and scowling workers with short haircuts  youre in business  you know some guys take girls  to the beach concerts farmers markets  ugly polish militaryintelligence offices  not so much  believe me id rather be at a farmers market  than bribing a bureaucrat to tell me whats on a spy plane  i have an idea  instead of working with gilroy the psychopath  instead of sneaking around trying to figure out  what he wants to steal from this plane  shoot him and be done with him  ive considered it  but somebody hired gilroy  if i want to find out whats going on and stop it  i need him breathing and you know that as well as i do  oh there he is right on time  you sure this guy konrad is the one to go after  low on the totem pole at work short on cash bad divorce  hes perfect  were meeting later today  hows your polish  rusty but his moms from moscow  i approach him as a russian businessman  buy him a few dinners  and hopefully we end this quick  playing on peoples loyalties is an art  especially when those loyalties can be murky and malleable  poke around too much and youll look suspicious  sometimes your best move is just to commit  thank you so much for meeting me  its uh better to do business eyetoeye  so what is it you could not discuss on email  your office has information on covert flights  passing through miami to poland  i need information on a flight   why  i own planes  im trying to get contract on this flight  it would be easier if i knew what was on the plane  its a little thing but worth a lot of money to me  russians  yeah please yeah let me get briefcase  of course commit too hard to the wrong side  and theres not much wiggle room  instead of an instant ally  youve just made an instant enemy  did you really think you could buy me  that i would betray my country to you  you know i was wondering  why there is extra security at office this week  easy konrad relax  oh you sons of bitches cost me everything  my job in poland my wife my family  over there now  youre going to tell me everything  and then im going to cut out your lying fsb tongue  so much for an easy target  youre seriously going to try to break into konrads office  fi what else can i do  i cant approach konrads coworkers  well what about a better angle on konrad  konrad the guy who wanted to interrogate me at gunpoint  but we do know that he cant stand the russians  thats our in  our in  are you volunteering  i confess i am a little curious  about what a psycho like gilroy is so interested in stealing  probably best to approach as american intelligence  ill need cash for this  deal  sams has a job hes been bugging me to take  fashion house that got robbed  the lady who runs it needs some help  the pay is pretty good apparently  yeah he talked to me about it too  but he sounded more interested in the models than the gig  sam you know that job the fashion gig  so youre in tell me that youre in  is the money there  oh the moneys there mikey this lady is loaded  i mean you should see her fashion house  its in the viceroy hotel and she is willing to pay  all right sam im in  oh ho ho thank you mike  thank you thank you thank you thank you  this covers christmas my birthday present  ill swing by and pick you up  when youre conducting surveillance  from a dusty cave in afghanistan  you daydream about airconditioning  swimming pools and iced tea  but spend a little time waiting for a socialite  to hand off her tiny dog to a canine beautician  and that afghan cave looks a little better  his usual pedicure of course the oatmeal shampoo  and dont forget to rub his belly  colonel peabody just loves when you do that   who doesnt  youre funny and cute  my girlfriend said you were a man of many talents  youre gonna trust her you should do your own research  sam said something about a job  one of your employees is stealing  his name is tim hastings  and weve been fighting a lot lately  now the numbers dont add up which means that moneys disappearing  and you would like us to find the money  i need you to be discreet  well keep it quiet  how much do you charge is 30000 enough   thats too much  please  this might take a couple of days  huh well  you wont be disappointed  recruiting an asset  is about making your target feel important  everything from the clothes you wear  to the location of the meeting  should communicate how vital the mission is  wear the right outfit pick the right deserted bar  and your target will be ready to engage  in some good oldfashioned espionage  we understand you were approached by the russians  are you from the agency  we have reason to believe  theres a russian spy targeting your office  yes  he posed as businessman  we need to figure out who this spy is and what hes after  of course  he asked me for information about flight  this flight is very important  security at my office has doubled  konrad we need to know  i cant  its not my job to guard this information  it wont be easy youll be taking a risk  we know how important this is  we will cover expenses anything you need  some assets work for money others believe in a cause  the most effective incentive though  is a combination of the two  all right perhaps i can find this information  but what about this russian cockroach  i think we have a file on him  good  good news michael  konrads enthusiastic  i think were gonna win the cold war   hes in  and then some  thing is i promised him the cia file  on the russian spy he almost captured  i think im gonna call your mom  ask her for some pictures of you in your military days  not my mom i dont want her involved in this fi  oh dont worry ill take care of it  you okay there mikey  yeah im fine  whats up with this easymoney job of yours  well bad news  i had my fingers crossed  that tim the thieving vice president  had a police record  but hes either clean or careful  owns a gun but its registered   no parking tickets even  and yet youre smiling  well the fashion house is having a big party later  and everyones gonna be in the atrium  that means one of us can sneak into tims office  while the other one keeps an eye on him at the party  let me guess which job youd like  well hey im partial to isabella models and mojitos  but i play fair  i figured wed flip a coin call it  heads cheater  quite a party  sam didnt feel like coming  hes using your access codes to go through tims office  if youre dealing with a trained operative  there are hundreds of places to hunt for documents  if youre searching a desk jockeys office  its a far shorter list  before you can say in the cabinet  behind the bookshelf or under the desk  youve usually found what youre looking for  aha  so which ones tim i want to keep an eye on him  hes standing right over there  now go  act casual  of course  let me have a word with you  who is he talking to now  thats my business partner damon  he started out designing and i was modeling  this companys our baby  im supposed to be at home looking at his designs   okay  i really should go  you should go  go home do some work   ill call you later with an update  thank you  spies are trained to keep track of multiple conversations  at the same time  standing alone as you eavesdrop is too obvious  you need to engage in a cover conversation near your target  hi  who are you wearing  black suit  love that dress  ive never seen anything quite like it  no one has darling its an alexander deschuno   oh  i bought  pure lipreading takes years to master  of course  but confirming what youre hearing by checking lips  is a much easier skill to pick up  dont get upset at me she said it  you know what  im gonna go talk to her right now cause this is ridiculous  good i think thats a good idea  you must visit my shop in the design district  vintage couture  im talking classics  thats great  hows it going over there  jackpot found the books in his office   sent you a photo  good  tims heading over to talk to isabella at her house  shell probably want to see that picture  okay good head over there  ill leave tims office how i found it ugly  you were at the party   what are you doing following me  my names michael  i work for isabella i think the three of us should have a talk  i got nothing to say to you  save it for inside  we found her financial records in your office  you were in my office  thats illegal i should have you arrested  it doesnt take long working in combat situations  before you start paying a lot of attention to little things  isabella  things that dont feel right like an open gate  or a pampered dog running around loose  often lead to much bigger things  oh my god isa isabella  jesus christ what the  like a body floating in a swimming pool  we have to call an ambulance  yeah its too late for that  or the the police  somebody already called them  of course knowing somethings wrong  and being able to do something about it are two different things  sometimes the damage is already done  thats my gun  what  what the hell is happening  youve been framed somebody set you up  no no dont dont touch it  you have to believe me i didnt shoot her  yeah obviously we got to go out the backyard  the backyard wont work theres aa wall  well be trapped  i vote the backyard  i told you were trapped  want to head back be my guest  otherwise step on my hands  we have to go around and get my car  if they find it theyll know i was here  theyll think  i know you want to chat tim but now is not the time  grab this wrap it around your wrist  fall when you do youll be pulling me up ready   easymoney gig  been checking the scanner since you called  the cops are sending more units to isabellas house  they found tims car but they didnt see you  well whoever pulled the trigger  must have skipped out right before we got there  we got to call the cops  im gonna explain everything right now  you know im innocent  so if we if we go to the police together  we can we can even take a liedetector test  how do i know youre innocent  well you said you knew i didnt shoot her  back at isabellas place  you didnt shoot her  doesnt mean you werent involved tim  you had isabellas books she knew you were stealing  no no no no no guys listen to me please  all right damon was the one who was stealing all right  i was trying to convince isabella but he had her fooled  i i needed to find proof  however the hell damon did it  theres no evidence in those books  every large money transfer  was authorized by isabella all right  she signed them herself  i kept telling her i kept telling her  she just she believed everything he said  you think damon killed her   i dont know  well if hes behind it he had help  mike he was at the party the whole time wasnt he  yeah he had the perfect alibi  he told me to go to her house  he um made it sound like she was gonna fire me  ive been fighting with her  you know my cars outside her place  the cops are probably matching ballistics right now even without your gun  hes got you pretty good  pretty good its perfect  im dead its over man  its not over  if it was damon someone pulled the trigger for him   we turn up the heat  maybe find some evidence  we punch holes in their stories  you really think we can do that  no while i pay damon a visit  youre going to go pay cash for a motel room  and youre gonna sit tight until we come get you  ill drop you in hialeah  we got snowed mike we let isabella down  she never saw it coming  whoever killed isabella sure did their homework  when dealing with a pathological liar  dont bother looking for signs of a guilty conscience  true deceivers enjoy the lie  they know how to look you dead in the eye  and usually shed a few tears on demand  so if you want to know when theyre lying  look for the little smile that comes  when deceiving a roomful of people  that bastard is giving quite the performance  he planned this whole thing  lets see how he does when we mess with his script  thank you officers so much for all the work youre doing  damon belmont im max isabellas max   we need to talk  excuse me  we can talk in private or in public  okay okay okay we are on the clock  we need to reroute all italy shipments through paris  ministerial commissions doing some search and seizures  if youre planning on using laguardia in the spring  whoa wait a minute hold on first things first  who the hell are you  she kept you in the dark  oh i dont even know where to begin  uh this is too big of a conversation  to be having right now  just suffice it to say im max  her other business partner from l a  what the hell are you talking about  i starch heroin into isabellas fabrics  production in asia distro through europe  were running about 4 million a week  so we need to improve our communication here  when you make an approach as a spy  you need to choose a role  that puts you in the center of the action  and explains why no ones ever hf edyou before  claiming to be a criminal can kill two birds with one stone  you throw around some names and places and dates to confuse them  show them some account books to make it sound credible  and make the dollar figures big enough to play to their greed  did you say 4 million a week  now about the cops sniffing around outside  if this little murder case  leads to a federal narcotics investigation  my new business partner gets strangled to death  with his designer tie  the police have this under control  they already have a suspect one of our vps  he and isabella were fighting all the time  did they arrest him  hes missing but they will find him  oh they better  or theyre gonna have another body to investigate  i shook the tree lets see what falls out  all right ill let you know if damon heads somewhere fun  you want to look at old pictures of michael  well i realized just the other day  that i hadnt seen that many pictures of michaels past   isnt that wild  its wild  so have you uh kept any  sure collecting dust in the garage  wheres michael  uh you know hes hes helping a friend  oh  but he was hoping that we could borrow an album or two  so thats all there is to this  you and michael have so much time on your hands  that you want to just sit and look at photos  yeah  every once in a while you got to take a break  you hang on ill go get them  theyve been in the back for a bit  couple of photos we get ears in that conversation  and the cops will have some new suspects   cover the front  like a blanket  contact microphones pickup sound vibrations through walls  allowing you to eavesdrop on conversations  pair one with a wireless transmitter  and you have a bugging device  that doesnt need to be in the same room as your target  we have got a serious problem  damon calm down what happened to your plan  we werent supposed to see each other for months  we werent even supposed to call each other  thats because things have changed  theres this new guy  damon enough stop freaking out  everythings going to be fine i promise  no ones gonna find anything anywhere  christ  what was that  interference on the speakers  is your phone on  no i didnt bring my phone i think someones here  of course bugging a room from the outside  makes it impossible to see potential pitfalls  just as a cellphone reacts  when its placed too close to your alarm clock  a roomful of speakers  can create radiofrequency interference  if youre spying on someone with a wireless signal  you think someones here  shut up  better get out of there mikey  hes coming out the back  what happened to your plan  we werent supposed to see each other for months  we werent even supposed to call each other  hows tim  well hes keeping his head down  but hes a bit of a wreck you know  hes a boy scout so he doesnt have  a lot of experience with this type of thing  we miss anything  nothing to miss just two guys having an argument  wonderful so checked in with my buddy at the station  cops are running a fullfledged manhunt for tim  so besides his car at the crime scene  they just found half a box of bullets in his garage  predictably perfect match for the rounds that killed isabella  damon and his partner have been busy boys  yeah speaking of partner heres the guy rick pederson  hes a club deejay he runs the shop during the day  nabbed a couple of times for dealing ecstasy  had an assault a while back  let me guess no paper trail connecting him  to damon or the fashion house  nothing i can find  today was probably the last time they meet  this is two guys covering up a killing  so theyre not exactly itching to break the law again  well that is exactly what we need them to do  lawenforcement cover ids are tricky  pose as a lead detective and youll have unlimited access  but a single call to the station and youre caught  you need to think smaller  nobody questions the credentials  of a lowly crimescene investigator   oh  excuse me  oh you guys are still here  detective parks said you guys were done  yeah we were but you know thats how it goes  you get some detective with a new theory  and the whole department does a 180  what are you guys working on now  just picking up some samples  look i cant really get into it  wait please  isabella was a dear friend of mine  well look its not like i get the big picture  im just a lab tech but sounds like theyre talking  about two guys working together   what  you didnt hear it from me  ill probably be back tomorrow with a whole new assignment  looks like murder  is in style this season  who is this  its your business partner max  you said the investigation was almost over  you lied to me  i did not iit was it is  then explain why the cops  are crawling around the fashion house  do i have to burn that place down  it is not my fault that the cops are idiots okay  this is an easy case they have tims car  everybody here knows he did it  well i might be able to find out some more  im down in the parking lot get out here now  merry christmas  my god what are you doing  im being proactive  the cops questioned tims neighbors too  turns out tim has a little girlfriend  she lives down in homestead  and shes going to tell me everything we need to know  where is tim hiding  i havent seen him in days  i swear we werent even dating  he was just helping me with my book  i already told all of this to the police  honey i am not the police  and you sure as hell dont want me to get upset wheres tim  he he made a deal with some guy at the docks  theyre gonna smuggle tim to the bahamas  wheres the dock  on 64th street theyre leaving at noon tomorrow  he said something about calling the cops  on some designer who tried to kill isabella  no no dont shut me in please no  you killed isabella and didnt tell me  wait a minute wait a minute  listen there is no evidence that leads back to us  i dont care what tim says i used a partner  there is no connection to me at all  it was the perfect crime   perfect crime  yes  except for one little thing  tim got away  dont worry  youre gonna just black out in about 15 seconds  wait a minute we can get rid of tim  we can kill him tomorrow  now that youve found him we can end this  we can make it look like he got killed trying to escape the country  the cops will close the case this whole thing goes away   you can pull that off  oh yes  all right listen up im heading to the everglades  im gonna feed the scream queen to the gators  you and your partner are gonna follow tim to his boat  when hes on board you put two in the back of his head  okay two in the back of his head  you idiots will be tempted to touch everything  dont just steal all tims money and leave  itll look like he met his ride out of town   and they robbed him and shot him  done  you you do this right  and the cops will stop investigating  and my stylish new business partner damon  gets to live  you wont regret this  oh boy  so devious  he he infiltrates american defenses and then slips away  did you track down the flight information  oh  please tell cia  file is locked in steel safe at office  with guard night and day  whatever is on this flight is a big secret  its very very dangerous  so it is impossible for russian to get  konrad i wasnt supposed to tell you this  one of your coworkers is working for the russians  theres a mole in your office  what you must tell me   i will find this traitor  no  not yet  itll compromise our operation and were running out of time  if this mole makes his move if we find out whats in that safe  no no no this will not happen  i will find file immediately  its tough to get someone to compromise their values  in only a couple of meetings  the only way to do that  is to compromise a few values of your own  how are you holding up  i was doing okay  considering ive been sitting in a motel room for three days  but let me get this straight  were having damon and his partner  try to kill me  well they wont actually succeed  we just need them to get caught by the cops looking guilty  so we rented you a boat  you walk in through the parking lot here  mike and i are gonna be covering you from the roof here  when you get to the docks hide  the cops come in get damon and rick  you know there are a lot of things grieving coworkers do  but hunting with guns for someone on docks  mm not one of them  but wont the cops arrest me too  yeah and then youll have the opening to tell them the truth  that plus your gun dropped into damons trunk  is all you need to blow their story apart  okay  relax its almost over  theres tim fi you got him  yep  theyre our guys  time to call the cavalry  yes hello police im down on 64th  and i just saw two guys taking guns out of their trunk  i i think theyre headed toward the docks  yes thank thank you very much  uhoh theyre not exactly heading toward the docks  and theyre not pulling out guns  fi what are they waiting for  i dont know somethings wrong  mikey that bench wasnt there this morning  they moved a bench  sam we got a problem  guys theyve got a detonator  theyre not planning on shooting tim  mike if we dont do something quick  tim is gonna be part of a big boom  id say take it out but more than one shot gives us away  then i cant miss  mikey do it hes getting close  hes still alive   fi pick him up  im on it  get over here lets go  tim tim  fi get out of there theyre closing in  freeze put your hands behind your head now  i tried to grab him  i know we saw fi the guy panicked  there was nothing you could do  hey so how far are we gonna take this  are we busting tim out of prison  are we letting them get away with killing isabella  damon and rick just screwed up the plan  we can use that  mike if thats screwing up the plan  then how come they got everything they wanted  from where im standing it looks like they won  they havent won until they know that theyve won  fi any chance they actually saw tim get arrested  no he went around the corner  sam whats the time frame on the cops announcing the bust  well theyre taking him in now processing him  i dont know a couple hours max  then we have a couple of hours  we drive damon away from rick  get them to turn on each other  we give the cops another killer  max no we shouldnt be talking  what the hell happened down there  everything is handled dont worry  listen im gonna lay low for a while so dont call  everything is handled everything is not handled  what the hell was that we talked  everythings fine the cops showed up  theres no way he escaped  no he did escape for the second time  no thats not possible  you know im starting to think  that he is the only one around here  who knows what the hell hes doing  you meet me at your office immediately  or youre a dead man  do you hear me  no  wait what are you still doing here  i cant talk to you police business  its okay we talked the other day remember  look i told you buddy my higherups never tell me much  oh there they are now  yeah this is finley  does damon know tim got caught  uh i dont think so but im following up on your leads  looks like that tip you got was a good one  hes listening in isnt he  yes sir ill be right back down there  were you listening to my call  im sorry  i just really want them to find whoever killed isabella  she was a dear friend of mine  shouldnt be too long to wrap this up  it looks like our killers plan  is coming apart at the seams  no one comes in here  i said two in the back of the head damon  i tried to follow the plan just like we talked about  but rick said using a bomb was safer  you feel safe now tims probably talking to the feds  i know i just found out he called the cops  whats our next move  oh besides you and i and rick  who else knows all about this  no one else trust me  okay thats good real good  we just have one little thing to close the loop  no do not kill me  look i know we messed up that was unfortunate   i have an idea  of course you do   we put this on someone else  you tried that  another someone else  my partner rick  hes the one who killed her anyway he shot her  no rick will talk hell blame you  hell take you down too  no no that gets messy  and i dont want anything getting back on me  we could kill him  no the cops will just be investigating his murder  well make it look like he killed himself  now thats interesting  how would you do that  ill write a suicide note confessing to everything  ill even scatter some of isabellas files around his office  you can shoot him  nope  ill get you a gun  one of the many weapons in the spy arsenal is sabotage  your enemy cant fight back  when their vehicles wont drive and their weapons wont fire  if youre handing a bad guy a gun  and you need it to jam accidentally  fatiguing the trigger assembly to break under pressure  is probably your best move  its undetectable  so nobody gets suspicious and nobody gets hurt  here you go  it was stolen  serial number has been filed off  which means its untraceable  completely untraceable  keep the car running  yeah  how we looking sam  cops are on their way mikey  what the hell are you doing here  do you remember in the club  when you said everything would go perfectly  you said everything would go perfectly  calm down everything is fine  everything is not okay tim keeps getting away  did you want me to get caught  what are you talking about nobody is gonna get caught  i cant go down for this  theres no other choice now  no  you son of a bitch  oh i hope hes okay  thats gonna bruise  police stop  he shot my friend arrest him hes the killer  well it took a couple of days of explaining  and my lawyers still trying  to get his head around the details  but once damon confessed the truth was out  thats all you needed  were selling the fashion house to a label in milan  isabella hosted benefits for a local petrescue center  so were donating the proceeds to them  sounds good  take good care of colonel peabody will you  yeah i will hey thank you for your help  yeah fi  hi michael  any progress with konrad  i just got a message from him  hes bringing me the flight information today  and your mothers been calling  ill head over there now  fiona returned the albums  but some of the pictures are missing  from when you joined the military  i think someone must have stolen them  so mysterious hmm  oh well bring them back mom  michael i thought we agreed  that from now on youd tell me the truth  this was a small job  fiona had to put together a dossier  to prove that i was a a russian spy  just a small job  its kind of a long story  which ill tell  it wasnt anything dangerous  look the last time you and i went through this it was hard  i i just dont like seeing you get hurt  so what you kept me in the dark to protect me  you know how it goes  these things arent so predictable  well she left one behind because it was special to you  no its probably cause theres  uh theres writing on the back  oh it was special to me  its one of the few times you ever sent me anything  to tell me where you were  well actually i had already left the country  i wrote that so that you didnt know where i was  oh  well then in the um grand scheme of things  ii suppose were making some progress   you  you want some iced tea  thatd be great  this information russian spy is after  is much worse than i thought  you found out whats on that flight  not what its who  whos on the flight  theres no names but he is maximumsecurity prisoner  this document is instruction on how to deal with him  id translate it for you but  if russian pig gets his hands on this envelope  hell never get it my friend  thank you konrad  we were right its bad  its a rendition to a black site in poland  somebodys highrisk enough to be flown alone  do not engage in conversation with prisoner  under any circumstance  sounds like a sweetheart  this kind of treatment is reserved  for worldclass bad guys michael  i know and somebody wants my help to break him out
