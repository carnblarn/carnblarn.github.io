                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them   an old friend whos informing on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  is that your mom again   if youre desperate someone needs your help  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere  you must be getting used to this  isnt there a part of you thats beginning to like miami  its fine fine  there are people who come here from all over the world  they dont have water front like this in afghanistan  it doesnt rain as much either there  there are pleasant parts of afghanistan  the mountains are nice  maybe we can vacation there someday  oh when you can travel again of course  some special occasion  speaking of which its my birthday in a few days  did you get me anything yet  yeah i got you something  you know for someone whos worked  as professional liar for most of his career  youre not terribly good at it when it counts  whats he doing your mystery man  getting heatstroke it looks like  well michael im pretending that im here  for more than just tactical backup  were supposed to be playing boyfriend and girlfriend  do you want me to get you a shaved ice fi  i mean i need someone okay  whats this guys name again  perry clark thats the name he gave me on the phone  and he said he was here to review your status  thats deskjockey jargon for what now  he may be able to get me off the blacklist  revoke my burn notice  and now youre about to piss him off on purpose  just a precaution fi i have learned to be careful  work around spies for a while and you learn to be careful  when it looks like youre getting what you want  thats when you tend to let your guard down get careless  look at him michael hes a cubicle monkey  calling the cops on someone can teach you a lot  a foreign agent would run so might an armed assassin  a bureaucrats going to act like a bureaucrat  you cant look in that sir  i think he just passed your little test  well arent you gonna talk to him  now might not be the best time  clark im going to slowly reach into my left inside pocket  with my right hand and give you my id very slowly  everybody remain calm i work with css   i have been more than patient mr westen  i was willing to meet you in a public park  as you requested rather than my office  i came down in the middle of my workday  im sorry i must have missed you  yeah i had a conversation with the police  about a suspicious man matching my description  youre not the first field op ive dealt with mr westen  believe me ive been vetted every which way  maybe we can set up a new time  i have had enough of new times and places and tests  i hope i dont have to remind you  that my recommendation carries weight  when it comes to removing you from this blacklist  bureaucrats live for respect  east of the balkans that means a bribe  in the west  its more about showing you know theyre in charge  and i expect a little more consideration for my time  yeah i apologize it wont happen again  its just i talked with a man on the phone  who burned me recently  he seemed unhappy  this is not about one nsa officer  who acted on information in a file  this is a departmental review in which i  lets set up a new time a new place to meet  well review the file  ill check my schedule  thank you  you keep pissing him off michael  youll be in miami forever  at least ill get an answer  the government sent him down here  and hes not gonna go back to dc  without getting a verdict on me  not at his pay grade anyway  you think you could convince him that you were set up  i read the dossier its pretty convincing  yeah sam mike im on my way over  theres that thing i need you to help me look into right away  sam im in the middle of   new car  yeah its a gift from the lady friend  i got it yesterday  its like driving on a cloud  what exactly do you do for these women sam  well  never mind  anyway thanks for coming  i didnt have much choice  yeah well you owe me  cause ive been checking into this guy from dc  what did you find out  well im still working on it  but hes a paper pusher  hes a name and a cubicle  thats all you got  well hey you know with the crap youve been doing  im not getting much love in dc  keep digging sam keep digging  i will brother  anyway so this guy were gonna go see  my lady friend hooked me up with him  hes got some kind of problem  and he heard that she had a boyfriend who could help  he heard that she had a boyfriend that could help  i was vague  i said i was  a freelance superherorobin hood kind of guy  thats vague  mike  a house like this i mean  its probably some expensive kitten up a tree  a cakewalk  youre sam yeah im sam  thanks for meeting me yeah no problem  this is michael the guy i told you about over the phone  yeah your assistant whats up bro  uh oh no no  its actually more like a partner sort of thing  so veronica said you want to talk  yeah dude ive got a serious problem  come inside  after you  place like this  you could have called halliburton to help you out  halliburton  i dont know him  im saying you seem to be doing  pretty well for yourself nick  oh no i dont own this  im a house sitter  i work three or four estates on the island  thats a job  house sitter  yeah these people are only here a few weeks out of the year  okay so do you need an application for that  sam  tell me your problem nick  thats dawn shes my fiance  she was kidnapped the day before yesterday  and the people that took her want like 5 million  and they think you have that kind of money  well the thing about this job  is that you drive these cars and you stay in these houses  and people kind of think that you own them you know  and it gets harder to tell them that you dont  and your fiance thinks  that you own these things  kind of i guess yeah  look i didnt want to tell her that i was lying to everyone  i was afraid id lose her man  i dont know what to do bro  what you need to do is call the police  they said that they would kill her if i did  they said theyd know here they sent me this  they kidnapped that girl last year  and her family called the cops and now shes dead  i got like an hour before theyre gonna call  i told them that i was trying  to get the money together but   hour  man i got nowhere else to turn  look you can have anything you want  i got about 15 grand i got a surfboard collection  anything you got it  are you guys gonna help me or not  theyre gonna kill her  okay okay sam why dont you go get fi  i think were gonna need a little help on this cakewalk  im on it mike  okay nick lets get you ready  about 40 of kidnapping victims are released safely  these statistics are affected by a number of factors  including the nationality of the kidnappers  the age of the victim  and whether a hostage negotiator is employed  i cant do this man  whats the point they want like 5 million bucks  the odds go down sharply  if no one has any money to pay the ransom  keep it together nick youre doing fine  just stick to the script do it like we practiced  really its gonna be okay  lets just get through this  okay  now do they usually call on time or  that answers that question  just like we rehearsed pick it up  nick pick up the phone  nick  three two one  hello  you have the money  im getting it i just i need to know if shes alive first  you talking to the police  no man i  i just need to know that dawns okay  shes fine but if you dont pay she wont be  well im not gonna pay until i get to see her  i need to know you didnt hurt her  you want 5 million bucks i want to see a video  youre pushing it carajo  youre really pushing it now hang on  a kidnapping is a business deal  the bad guys have negotiating power  since theyre selling the life of a loved one  but then again they have a market of one  so they have to work with you  go to the coconut grove mall  two hours  well call you  jesus oh jesus i thought i was gonna puke bro  you did fine nick you did fine  so you understand   you pick up the package and you walk away  you got it  you dont look at us you dont talk to us  you just walk out with the video  fiona and i will be watching  to see if the kidnappers have someone there  and sam will follow in the car if he sees anyone leave  okay so i walk to the car okay  no nick focus  you just walk away  walk away  pick up the package and you leave  like were not even there  but wait  you will be there right  yes we will be there okay go ahead  unlock it first  okay  working with untrained amateurs introduces an element of risk  its a risk you have to live with in a lot of operations  although you often find yourself wishing  everyone went through green beret training in high school  you buying me a birthday card  just windowshopping fi you got eyes on nick  yes  all the way from the escalators  to that charming little  they have a fabulous little teddy in there  it would make a great gift  ive never seen you wear  anything but mens shirts to bed  fair enough  theres a mens store on the third floor  nice selection  the ones with the big buttons are easier to undo  focus fi  can you see people on my side of the mall  cause i cant look at everybody  yeah  oh nick just got a call  hes looking around  there he goes  anyone looking curious  theres a decent candidate at the caf  gray shirt on your 2  ah i see  hows our ace operative performing  looking good  hes going to get the package now  okay nick walk away  just walk away nick  no dont dont  he made me fi  once a kidnapper knows youre on to him  hell try to contact his partners to have the hostage killed  at that point you have a choice  you can start choosing wreaths for the hostages funeral  aaaah  or take a hostage of your own  thanks  nick just pay them what they want please  i want to go home  theyre gonna call you tonight  jesus  oh im so sorry im so sorry  okay stop saying that  ohh god  i screwed everything up bro  seriously stop talking  stop moaning now  the moaning  nick stop moaning  listen nick  im not saying im happy  with how things went down today either  but this can still work out  in some ways were better off  how how are we better off dude  you got some kidnapper tied up someplace  you got dawn   oh wait  oh i get it youre gonna trade dawn for the dude  no  hes just a hired hand  if they find out weve got their guy  theyll kill her immediately probably leave town  so how are we better off  they want 5 million or they kill dawn yes  last time i checked we dont have 5 million right  so our only hope is to find dawn  before they find out we dont have 5 million  we will convince this guy to help us find dawn  yeah okay  okay  michael the art of turning someone into a double agent  is delicate  the target has to be put into a fragile psychological state  get this crazy bitch away from me  fortunately fragile psychological states  are a specialty of fionas  i was just helping our friend lucio  into a more cooperative mood  wheres sam  i had to get some air  it was getting a little uh loud in here  so what do we know about our new friend  well his name is lucio velazquez  columbian national  hes got a rap sheet here and at home  he and his brother ran an extortion racket in columbia  his brother got caught lucio ran  good to meet you lucio  go ahead and taser me all you want  im not gonna tell you nothing  taser oh no  we have something much better than a taser  weve got an instant camera  its always easier to turn someone  who works for a criminal gang into a double agent  the more secretive and ruthless their side is the better  you work on their fear that any hint of disloyalty  will get them killed by their own people  lucio you need to think about your situation very carefully  you have been caught in the middle  of a delicate assignment  say we let you go and give this photo to your boss  along with a cooperating witness statement  youre about to give to the fbi  no no no no i never made no statement  heres the form looks real huh  well fill it out sign it on your behalf  sams pretty good with a computer  thanks mike its just photoshop  oh look here you have a summons  it means youre going to testify in court against your boss  so anyway we take the photo we put it in the file  sam here has ties to the fbi and other government agencies  just in case your boss does his homework  i have to say you guys look pretty tight here  my guess is he wont feel right until youre dead  what do you want man  you now work for us lucio  you tell us what we want to know  you do what we say and that is how you will stay alive  wheres dawn  i dont know  you dont know lucio  no no no no no i swear i swear i dont know  reyes keeps everything separate  reyes your boss  i find people in clubs in rich neighborhoods  and reyes he does the job with two other guys  someone else guards the hostages  everythings separate nobody knows each other  he does that for security  let me be clear here the girl dies you die  if youre lying  im not lying all right  now i need to check in with reyes im already late  hes gonna know that something is wrong  fine call him  you broke your foot walking down the stairs at the mall  you forgot to call  broke my foot i didnt break my foot  aah ugh  there you go  there are a lot of little bones in your foot so youll be able to walk  you want to borrow the mercedes man  yeah  just please try not to scratch that car  its an s550 amg worth like 120 grand  and we need a house  theres a penthouse downtown that i watch  what do you need it for  we need to find where dawn is being kept  lucio doesnt know  his job is just finding targets for reyes  so were gonna have lucio bring him a new target  a rich society wife  enchant  and a disgruntled bodyguard  you bitch  talk to reyes  tell him im willing to help him pull the job  but hes got to show me where he keeps the hostages  hopefully theyll bring sam to where dawn is  and we can grab her but we got to move fast  and we need a target that will make him drool  from karachi to bogot  every kidnappers favorite resource is a corrupt employee  her husbands worth 200 million good work lucio  an employee can handle alarmspolice  you can get financial informationbank accounts  youve even got a fall guy if anything goes wrong  to a professional kidnapper  a good man on the inside is worth a lot  and a bad man on the inside is worth even more  lucio  okayokay i cant do this  okaymani cant reyes is gonna kill me if he finds out  wellthats the point lucio  you do your job well  he wont find out and youll stay alive  did reyes like our little business opportunity  the rich lady and the bodyguard yeah  he loved it okayweve been following them around all day  he wants to meet with your guy talk terms  what about dawn  hes impatient the guy wants his money  i held him off a little bit  but i dont know if i can do it much longer  im supposed to be calling you right now  and telling you  that you only got 12 hours or the girls dead  tell him 12 hours isnt long enough  tell him nicks family has hired a hostage negotiator  and that the guy wants to talk to him in person  with reyes nonocome on you cant be serious  you convince him its the best way for him to get his money  we just need to buy enough time to find dawn  and then youre donelucio  youll do it  do i got a choice noyou dont  youve got my number tell me where and when  the thing about doubling anyone  is that the more they do for youthe deeper they get  the deeper they getthe more you can make them do  great if youre running them but hard on the source  the suicide rate is above average  i understand your concernsmr westen  i have worked with field operatives before  i may find your priorities  somewhat baroque and unnecessary  but i suppose thats why i work in an office  and you run around the world with guns  i suppose soyes  soyouve now had your opportunity  to screen me in public  are you satisfied that im not some shadow figure  sent to liquidate you  can we do our business now yes  nowi have security concerns of my own  as im sure youre aware  your case has certain issues pertaining to  national security  issues that require a private venue  nowmy office in fort lauderdale is  i would not be able to make it up there  for at least a few days  thats unfortunate  maybe this isnt important enough to youmr westen  i have to get back to dc  you could come by my place the night after tomorrow  you hope to gain some sort of homecourt advantage  noits just that i need to be around here  for the next few days for my day job  if there were any other way believe me  fine call me with a time  thank you  yeah you wanted to talk to me  andrew chambers hostage negotiator for the family  okayyou got a sniper trained on youmr chambers  tell me why i shouldnt kill you  nicks familys not gonna pay if you shoot the negotiator  youd end up with nothing for your trouble  how do i know youre not a cop  cops dont make themselves available as potential hostages  they dont get paid enough for that  i dont know what the magnification is on your snipers scope  but the label the labels armani  cops dont fit armani  how do i look i look goodright  you gonna keep playing games cause i got all day  nice suit get in  i like doing my meetings this way  i hope you dont mind  no fine by me  you know im not wearing a wire thats smart  plusthe massage music its really nice  and calming  okayall right  looklet me get straight to the point  im gonna have a hard time  getting nicks family to pay 5 million for dawn  ohis that so  dawns not part of the family  the engagement really isnt that official yet  i dont want to talk out of school  but i dont think the family likes her very much  welli wonder how much they would pay  for a smartass hostage negotiator  trust me at my hourly rate youd be doing them a favor  sweetiecan you go a little lower and to the left  i have a trouble spot right about yeahright there  okayso give me a number a counter offer  i think i can close at a million  1 million  thats 20 of my price  mmmyou are good with numbers  i take 20 of my price ill give you 20 of the girl  hostage negotiators hear that one a lot  its funny the first few times  ohyou think i was joking  it comes down to how much were willing to move on the price  i gave you a number now its your turn  3 million thats as low as i go  3 millions gonna be a tough sell  ill bring it to the family  but theyll need at least    nowcould you have one of your boys turn the heat up  cause its a little chilly  they paid you for the whole hourright  man 1 and 2  is that a makarov i dont know  the the guy who owns this place is into guns and stuff  wellthats a sovietissue sidearm from 1951i think  its a beautiful piece  i guessyeah  in a row to begin the evening for josh beckett  and the last one on the curve ball  how big is that  its 60 inchesi think  qualitys nice  now the curve ball  is that satellite  its directv hd  thats why the the pictures bigger  what the hell are we talking about  looki know that you asked me  to stop talking about it and just stay here and watch tv  but i cant watch any more  are you gonna be able to save her  please say yes  foul off to the right  were working on it  how did we do  i bought us 48 hours  yeah im setting up a meeting with lucio tonight  lucios gonna set up a meeting with sam  and sam will get them to tell us where they keep the hostages  and were gonna finish this  lucio reyes wants to meet your guy tomorrow to set up this job  he wants to move on it quick  did you get a time  yeah noon  i think hes getting sick of waiting  he wants to get rid of the girl  hold him offlucio  remember if she dies  yeahi dietoo  we keep this upthoughman im dead anyway  we on  were on  gps devices are becoming more and more common these days  mostly theyre for nervous parents tracking children  but theyre perfectly good for other uses  is it working  yeahlike a charmmike  you can follow me all over miami with that thing  but wouldnt it be easier to grab her  when she takes her morning jog along the beach  nice and early  ill consider it  youre the big boss man here right  thats what they tell me  okaywell the issue now  im taking a pretty big risk here  so i expect to be rewarded  i meanthis is my employer  were talking about kidnapping here  so as soon as this goes down im out of a job  wellif what you tell me about her husband is true  youll be very wealthy when you finish  i like the sound of that  all rightnowlook if this is gonna happen  i got to know the vehicle youre taking her in  and i want to see where youre gonna keep her  cause i hear stories of people being shoved in dungeons  and that aint gonna flyokay  she cant get hurt  she gets hurtwe get a lot of extra heat here  heywe take care of the operationokay  noyou hold it right there my columbian friend  this is 20 million bucks were talking about  and youve been on my ass  about every little detail about how i deliver her  as of right now im on the hook  for life without parole for kidnapping  same as youbuddy  soyou like it or not were a team  fineill show you come on  theyre on the move  got them  this is the type of car you use to grab them  reyes yeah we prepare them like this  we use it once and then we discard them  shame to discard it  when this job is over might get me one of these  might get two  it still has that newcar smell  sothis is where you keep themhuh  and you have security   theyre well taken care of here  five years we do this  only one  unintentional death  not bad  all rightythen  lets do this  lucio you should have called  i wanted to talk to you facetoface  ive done all i can  running a double agent is a relationship  theres a giveandtake  mostly takebut sometimes you have to give  lucioyoure doing a great job youre almost out  you stay with it and youll be rewarded  well set up a bank account for you  reyes wants to do the other job  the one with your friend  he wants to do it now  he said its better  to kill the girl so they can start the other job  he told me to call you to finish this  finish it how  you have two hours to get him the money  or the girl dies  nick you said we had two days  now two hours theyre gonna kill her  not if we get to her first we know where theyre keeping her  maybe we should just call the cops  you think the cops can put together a rescue plan  in two hours  the bad guys will be monitoring the police scanners  one whisper of this on the radio and shes dead  sowhat im supposed to just sit here  noyoure going to get me the yellow pages  and tell me where the nearest pharmacy and gardening store is  i need to pick up a few things  yellow pages  broi have a computer  rescuing a hostage isnt about battering rams and guns  charge through a door with a gun  and chances are the person youre trying to save  will be the first person lying on the floor  dying of acute lead poisoning  so you come up with alternatives  ingredients from the local pharmacy  mixed with aluminum foil powdered in a coffee grinder  will make a serviceable flash grenade  that will stun anyone for a good 20 feet  thermite is another handy tool  with a surface temperature of 1000 degrees  its used to weld together railroad ties  it will make pretty short work of most lockstoo  go you dont have much time  im not excited about you seeing reyes by yourself  someone needs to stall him in case you guys need more time  mike nobodys got your back  this goes bad reyes could get tipped off  the only other option for backup is nick  you guys like that idea  call me when you got dawn  est limpio  nice view  wheres my money  would you consider being paid in bonds  bonds i said cash  i know but a bearer bond is as good as cash  its issued without a named holder  listenim not saying its right  but the family has liquidity issues  there are tax implications  i dont care about the tax problems i want my money  i understandand i am trying to get you that money  nonono youre trying my patience  i said cash i expect cash  your time is up  go aheadshoot good luck hiding the body  my guess is the cops show up first  because that is a very loud gun youre holding  i am just trying to make this deal  look at it from the familys perspective  they shell out 3 million in cashand then what  it raises flags at the bank  with their investment advisors their employees  people piece it together that they paid you off  that is not my concern  but it concerns me because if word gets out  that this family paid a ransom  other guys like you will come out of the woodwork  i just need to make sure  that this never happens to this family again  theyre gonna call me any second  would you mind taking that gun out of my face  if you cant get through a door without attracting attention  the next best thing is to attract a lot of attention  once everyones looking at the door  wondering whats going on you can pop in a flash grenade  and they wont see anything for a while  drop the gun get it down  get it down  attaboy youre not as dumb as you look  youre safe  were going to untie you youre safe  look at me youre safe now  unlike stocksbonds are financial instruments  nowthat is the family may i take this  tell them its cash or she dies  i got it  yeah  heymike its finished  nothey wont do stocks nor bonds  yeahi explained the difference  i understand  thats it they wont pay the ransom in cash  nowi hope you can reconsider  killing a hostage get out  get out  qucarajo estpasando  leticia no le atendii al telfono  mad  drop the weapons now  on the ground  seriouslybro i dont even know how to thank you  uhthose surfboards right there  yeahi dont surf  youre awesomebro  ohsounds

thanks  nick  heybabe  you lied to me  babyi love you  you lied to me  another happy ending  mr clark  ive never done a meeting  in a private home like this beforemr westen  im not even sure its allowed  thanks for bending the rules  yeah again no guaranteesmr westen  were gonna have to cut this short  you tell me your side of the story ill get back to you  it shouldnt take long ohgood  my wifes expecting me to actually make my flight tonight  great  you have any coffee  coffee yeah  i think i have some instant  thats fine  the longer youve been in the game  the more you have to be careful  about underestimating an opponent  say you dont think much of bureaucrats  dont feel theyre worth your time or attention  then a bureaucrat is the perfect person  to send to kill you  wowyoure pretty good  let go  itll be less painful for you  itll look like you hanged yourself  no surprisereally no workno money  this would have been easier  if youd kept our appointment in fort lauderdale  i had some things arranged  ahwell  theres no way to anticipate every danger  you need a backup plan for when things go wrong  sorry to inconvenience you  ugh ughh  thats why homecourt advantage is so important  mikethe cops found your assassin in an alley this morning  he bled to death  no id on himand his fingerprints didnt show up  in any government database  soofficially i guess the guy never existed  he must have been impersonating the real perry clark  do you think that the guy who burned you sent him  not a bad guess thankssam  you were right about him you know  you must feel a little proud of yourself  i wanted my burn notice resolved  i talked myself into denying my instincts  thats nothing to be proud of  im finefi  you almost died  thats happened before  so im not allowed to be concerned  to worry  you can worry about me  like nick worried about dawn  hopefully not exactly like that  ohhe was head over heels in love  i talked to him about you  about what i should get you for your birthday  a makarov  he said you would like it  ohh  is it the same  nick convinced his boss to sell it to me at a discount  thank youmichael  happy birthday fi
