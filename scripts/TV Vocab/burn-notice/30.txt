                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you   a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  whether youre hunting down extremists in the mountains of kashmir  or tracking arms dealers through the streets of moscow  the life of a spy takes a toll  so during downtimes  you work out eat right and try to recharge your batteries  because you never know whats waiting for you around the corner  hello michael  this is bud bail jumper   we just got back from the everglades  youve a real chair in this dump  poor buds in a bad mood he didnt like the music in my trunk  why is he here  were killing time  waiting for the bail bondsman to open his office  you know hes been throwing me more jobs than i can manage lately  and i was thinking as long as youre still burned  trudging through swamps for guys like bud   im not hurting for money that bad  could have fooled me  think about it michael  your strategic knowhow  my expertise in the field  my brains your brawn  time for you to go bud  detective paxson  miami pd this is detective lopez   you mind if we ask you questions  im in the middle of something  i understand youre a bounty hunter do you have a bailenforcers license  actually im freelancing  actually youre harboring a fugitive consider this a warning  detective i spoke with some officers at the station recently  and i think we cleared up all the questions they had  ive different questions  theyre about a traffic incident  three cars blown up three more totaled  apparently we have a oneman wrecking crew on our hands  how can you be so sure its a man  im as progressive as the next gal miss glenanne  but someone matching mr westens description  was spotted driving away from the scene  white male dark hair  athletically built  i hope your department pays overtime  because youre gonna be searching for a few hundred thousand suspects  ive got just one  stuffs been blowing up pretty steadily since you arrived in miami  are you gonna answer my questions  or am i gonna pick my way through everything you own  that would be a workbench six power tools  four yogurts three yogurts i actually had one  blueberry  well you can tell me all about it at the station mr westen  get in the car  im gonna enjoy this  welcome to your worst nightmare mr westen  you look wretched michael  well its not a day spa in there fi  spent the last 24 hours in the drunk tank  so detective paxson wasnt questioning you the whole time  no there was plenty of that too  shes gonna be some real trouble  she already is she cost me my bounty   ill make it up to you sometime  well how does now sound  i lined up a new gig ill fill you in on the details over lunch  come on fi not another bail jumper  but one of my old bail jumpers got me the job  its a referral   so hows stevie  doing time at raiford mediumsecurity  says hi by the way  her brother jumped bail on forgery charges  i chased him to boca  had to hit him with a brick to get him in the car sweet guy   he your partner  well youd have to ask him that  what can we help you with  this is my son brandon hes been staying with his dad howard  were separated howard hasnt let me see or talk to brandon for three days  it sounds like you should be talking to a lawyer  i have three of them  they all say itll take months to get him into court  howard just needs someone to knock some sense into him   im not sure  its not a problem   anything else you need  i just want to see my son  everything will be fine  right michael  excuse me  do you know my new girl  she rebuilt this engine by herself  im telling you just put a nice sturdy tool in that womans hand  i got it sam find out anything  yeah i asked around about your lady detective  turns out you got a stalker with a badge  she checked every selfstorage place from here up to fort lauderdale  she found some surveillance video of you ducking into a place down by homestead   not good  what you got there  some c4 and detonators  shes gonna own them soon cause shes working on a warrant  theres a hearing in a few days but you got to get your stash out before  are you coming michael  you know since im helping you avoid felony charges  i thought maybe thered be a lunch in it for me  next time  geez  i got you baby  typical howard spends  and he cant find an hour to take care of his yard  go ahead and take it  just keep your eyes on the street this should be pretty straightforward  yeah ma  its somebodys birthday today  i thought you could come over for a nice dinner with sam and fiona  were celebrating birthdays now  we always did dont you remember sixth grade  your friend billy kane was there  it was his party mom  its never too late  all right where are we getting takeout from  who said anything about takeout   so you coming or not  ill try  michael i dont want to hear how youll try i want you to promise  fine i promise ill try  you can stop now  you can stop now   we just want to see your son  you dont understand  im sure whatever the issue is you can work it out with your ex  thats not what i mean  he was kidnapped  of course he was  brandon didnt come home from school on thursday  i got a call   i dont know the guys name  is he asking for money  no i work at a diamond wholesaler  he wanted information about an upcoming shipment  said not to contact the police or id never  see brandon again   hes calling today with instructions  how could you not tell me  i didnt want you calling the police i was trying to protect brandon  that was not your decision to make hes my son too  look  he just wants diamonds im going to give them to him  howard its not that simple  if this guy really wants to disappear he has no incentive to return your son  brandons old enough to identify him  what what are you saying  you know what hes saying howard  theyre not gonna bring brandon back we should call the police  no no cops he said he would kill him  enough  michael and i will take care of him  without involving the cops  but you cant be at each others throats okay  when the kidnapper calls again youre going to say  youre not doing anything until you get proof that your son is alive and unhurt  and youre gonna ask for a meeting   you think hell come  if he wants his diamonds he will  and if were lucky well follow him back to where brandon is   well wont that be dangerous  it doesnt matter ill do it  whatever it takes to get brandon back  i told howard not to take that stupid job  sales manager  we were doing just fine as reps   you work together  we did  it was great till he took that promotion  long hours travels  and now this  well im sure this was not part of the plan when he took the job  well he should have known the risk  patricia i want you to try something its a  a relaxation exercise i do in situations like this  i want you to close your eyes  and breathe deep  picture a peaceful mountain stream can you do that  now picture yourself  drowning the kidnapper in the stream  youre taking a rock from the stream and raising it above your head   and with tremendous force youre bringing  we got something hes passed by twice  smart criminals have a variety of ways  to find out if a meeting is under police surveillance  some are more subtle than others   howard right  yeah  im santora  nice to meet you  throw a few punches  and any cops in the area have to come running  god do something  hes testing us  but hes gonna kill him hes  if you want your son back youll stay in the car  you got any friends around here i should know about  you tell anyone about our little arrangement  look at me howard  behavior in a combat situation is unpredictable  sometimes trained soldiers go screaming for the hills  sometimes guys who have never fired anything bigger than a cap gun  turn out to have ice in their veins  nobody knows  let me see my son  todays headline  the kids fine  now lets be clear  youre not calling the shots here  youre not gonna make any more demands and youre not gonna try anything cute  if anyone touches me if im a minute late  checking in with my guys you never see the kid again  got it  good  thats just so you dont forget  now  lets talk about my diamonds  in the field  its often your human instincts that jeopardize an operation  helping people is great  but there are times that impulse can get people killed  sometimes the right thing to do is let a guy bleed for a while  stay here  he kept hitting me   i didnt know what to do  you did everything right  he said he wants the stones in 24 hours or brandon dies  thats not gonna happen  howd we do  not so great  santora didnt go near the kid  hes hanging out at a bar sipping mojitos  mike this guys not afraid to be seen  i thought you could follow him to where brandon is i thought  hes smart hes keeping the job compartmentalized  howards at the hospital getting stitches   that was all for nothing  not nothing  well know when he moves i got a buddy keeping an eye on him  why cant you just grab him and waterboard him or something  make him tell us where brandon is  you torture somebody theyll tell you anything to make it stop  no there are better ways to get reliable information  sam how do you feel about a little reverse interrogation  never been a big fan   whats reverse interrogation  we used to do it during the cold war  you send one of your guys to be interrogated  to learn what theyre worried about  you play your cards right the questions will tell you all about them   you play your cards wrong  have a little faith sam  how long do you think itll take  car building   some cop lights a couple hours  all right call me when its done  were gonna find your son  this is a valuable lesson for you   c4 is meant to be used not stored  ill keep that in mind  im serious all those times you told me  to make the explosions smaller i shouldnt have listened to you  paxson wouldnt have anything to hang you with  when youre concerned you might be walking into a police stakeout  there are a number of things to look out for  parked cars or vans  hold on fi  workers that seem unusually preoccupied  and curious kids no matter where you go in the world  little boys like candy puppies and cops  i think our detective friend had a surprise planned  mr westen  detective paxson and detective forgetyourname  i was thinking about renting one of these storage units   you mind if i look at yours  storage unit  or you could give us the fake name you used when you rented it  or go ahead and clear it out dont let us stop you  i think theres been a misunderstanding i heard you were in the neighborhood  i came by to see you  i wanted to give you some receipts  give you a better idea of what ive been doing where ive been going  that ones for breakfast fi had a spanish omelet  egg whites only  thank you  if you get the urge to destroy any evidence stop by  well be waiting for you  was that flirting or does she hate you  i am not her type  mike you ready to do this im all set  seriously though i think this is a little risky  im on my way  when it comes to cover ids  impersonating a bad cop is much better than impersonating a good one  an honest cop follows policies and procedures  from the way he cuts his hair  to the approach he takes when carrying out a traffic stop  pose as a good cop and you have to go by the book  pose as a bad cop and you can throw out that book and write your own  hi there  detective finley  nice seats  what is that pearl leather  let me call my lawyer he can tell you all about them  all right just relax  im here unofficially  just think of this as a business meeting  you want to do a business meeting how about you make an appointment  whens a good time to talk about someone whos moving in on one of your scores  just worked a drug bust  heard something that might interest you  in the criminal world  selling yourself as a colleague often means doing something illegal  so while snorting lactose isnt pleasant  it may put peoples minds at ease  got this on the bust too   puts hair on your chest ill tell you that  whats this you heard about a score  yeah it was a coke buy down in overtown  busted a guy i know a junkie named shep  hes trying to get me to lay off him  cause he says he knows something about a plan to  rip you off  some junkie told you this  hes a snitch hey the guys a mess but his intels usually good  so whyd you bust him  well i take him in every so often just to keep him in line  so listen  im taking him to the station  for a couple of grand  you can question him first  interested  he said something about a kid if that means anything  a kid  yeah he didnt say much more than that  man i cannot get over this leather  its handtooled right  where is this guy  so what youre saying is  michaels missing his own birthday party  hes busy  busy  busy being shot at or busy get blown up  does he ever take a day off  damn it  i mean you know a little consideration is all im asking  im making an effort so should he  well he seems to be making progress  dont fool yourself honey  loving michael is always trench warfare  you tell him to come to the party  busted a few raves here  dont worry no one comes around now  place is condemned  its where i do my freelance work  so the snitch is in there you got my money   here you go ill take it from here  oh oh no my friend  thats not how it works we question this guy together  no offense but i dont like people knowing my business  yeah no offense but i dont care your business doesnt concern me  what concerns me is nobody touches my prisoner but me  i got my own way of asking questions  yeah and i got to explain every scratch when i take him down to the station  if you want to come down there with me fine  otherwise we do this my way  and what about later this guy shep gets to mouth off  dont worry about that  i got enough on him to send him to prison on the moon  hell keep his mouth shut  so nobody knows you got this guy here huh  dont get any ideas  as far as my supervisors concerned im working on a case  officially im in the middle of interviewing you  so if anything happens to me he knows who to come looking for  lets do this  so i dont know you  but i hear you know me  and my business  interrogation professionals dont ask questions directly  they hide what they know and dont know  youre a real prince finley a real standup guy  after all ive done for you this is what i get  nothing personal just business  amateurs tend to ask for exactly what they want  who told you about the kid  its like playing poker with your cards showing  i think your buddy here wants to kiss me finley  hey im not that type  answer the question   who told you  a friend of a friend  i didnt get his name  they didnt give me details i didnt ask for them  all right tell me about this job  they needed help moving a a kid  they wanted a place that they could stash him for a few days off the street  i found it can i go now  you can go when i find out  what the hell is going on  the guy who hired you he say when they were planning this  come on you think theyre gonna tell me when  yeah right after they told me their vacation plans  and their social security numbers  i dont know  you got a smart mouth  maybe you should start using it to save your ass  they told me  to find a place  where they could stash the kid  for a few days   do you want me to say that slower  whered you meet them  right do you think im stupid  i tell you that and youre gonna go tell them and im gonna get killed  you worry about that later you got more immediate problems  all right all right  all right it was a restaurant a diner i think  when people are desperate for information  they start filling in the blanks often without realizing it  its something fortunetellers rely on  it works pretty much the same way for spies  think harder  although fortunetellers usually dont get smacked around as much  it was a diner  it had burgers and fries  the seaside diner   was that it off the causeway  yes thank you  i met the guy at the seaside diner  whatd this guy look like  well i dont know he was a guy  was a white guy maybe  white  im just gonna go out in miami and look for a white guy  youre gonna have to do better than that  no all right all right all right it was the waitress knew him  she called him flowers  they knew him there  and thats it thats thats all i know  get over to the seaside diner now  ask around for a guy named flowers  surprising how much a guy remembers when you help him out a little  listen this is taking longer than i thought i got to make a call  you two play nice  fi get over to the seaside diner its off macarthur causeway  santora is sending a guy you might be able to tail him back to brandon  just stay out of sight all right  stay out of sight youre seriously telling me that  its nothing personal things are just getting a little tense around here  so you and your friends thought that you could rip me off  that right what was the plan with the kid  i told you everything i was supposed to get  what was the plan  i was paid a lousy  you think i dont want to tell you  put the knife away  youve got a sharp knife   get that knife out of my face  fi just go now  fine you want to you want to know the plan   yeah i do  all right  well youre never gonna know the plan with a knife  because cutting me up  aint gonna turn me into a mind reader  there friend  my prisoner my rules remember  now you want me to lean on him all you have to do is ask  we clear  now put it away  we may have a lead on brandons location  youre going to get him now   if things go according to plan  ill come with you i can help  well thats sweet and very brave but you are gonna get yourself shot  if thats what it takes to get our son back i dont care  brandon is gonna need you alive  getting shot sounds noble until it actually happens to you  dont volunteer for it unless its absolutely necessary  brandons gonna be fine  i know it  you wanna do something for your son  dont forget this moment  and dont ever work together  not all couples can handle it  okay this flowers he show you where the kid is  no they drove me through the neighborhood  the route they were gonna take i dont remember  ive had enough of youdontremember   no more warnings  ive answered all your questions  i want you to tell me who is trying to rip me off  and i want a house on star island  filled with strippers and bikinis  but wishing just doesnt make it so man  its time to focus  listen i assume there isnt a sign on the place  that says the kids here so how would he know if he saw it  come on you got guys with the kid  maybe shep saw them   yeah i got two guys  could be  i saw guys but i didnt talk to them i dont know their names   did you see the kid  no  okay santora so calm down he didnt see the kid   maybe its not the same place  he didnt see him because the kid  is in a shed behind the house  now shut up and let me think  searching for a concealed enemy who could be anywhere  is a waste of time  yeah its jimmy  nobodys heard of flowers at the diner  usually your best bet is to stay put  and give your enemy a reason to come to you  whats going on  is there something i should know about  dont worry about it  just get back to the house and watch the kid  to tail someone  you need both skill and instinct  you need skill because the driving is tough  you cant get too close and you cant drift too far away  you cant go too fast or too slow  you need instinct because every turn  every lane change  every bridge raises the risk of being seen  anyone can be trained to follow a car  but it takes good instincts  to know when its time to stop following  so i had one of my guys ask around  no one at that restaurant ever heard of anyone named flowers  why is that my fault  maybe he went to the wrong place  he went to the diner you lying son of a bitch  why would i lie to you  thats it  im shutting this thing down before it gets any worse  when you work with someone long enough you learn to trust them  when things go bad  that trust is the difference between life and death  of course knowing that doesnt make it less terrifying  to back a play you know nothing about  listen  i know this guy shep  hes a pain in the ass but his information is good  yeah because he told me some story about a guy who doesnt exist  maybe the guy does exist he could be one of your own guys  so one more time  this flowers guy  what did he look like  he has slickedback hair  feels a muscle guy  he wears those muscle shirts to show off his arms  thats the best i can do thats all i got  thats flowers youre sure  thats the guy who told me about the kid  what is wrong with you  thats my guy  like you said my own guy is trying to steal from me  what guy  his names jimmy  the guy i sent to the diner to look for flowers  it turns out the son of a bitch is flowers  hes supposed to be watching the kid   instead hes planning to rip me off  things are little hot right now  you know you can call it off  let the kid go  hell just give him to me ill tell his parents i found him  its too late for that he saw my face  its over i got to clean this whole mess up  what are you gonna do  listen youve been a standup guy  i appreciate that  and i dont wanna cause you problems but that guy in there shep  hes got to die  now  every profession has occupational hazards  butchers cut themselves house painters fall off ladders  and operatives get asked to help kill their own people  you watch it friend   i got unis checking on my interview  back off  this is my snitch i got to be able to explain what goes on  my own guys are turning on me if hes part of it hes got to go   they all do  i see im just supposed to sit back  and hope none of this blows back on me no way   thats not how this goes down  you got any ideas im listening  yeah i say that  dropped him off by the road  i let him out cause he was sick from the dope  ill just tell them that he attacked me and he tried to escape  wait you  yeah dont you remember hes my prisoner  how am i gonna explain a suspect full of these random bullet holes  well have the damn fbi here its better this way  put a few rounds in his chest with my gun but you do it out by the road   you understand  your gun  what the hell are you talking about  i got to be able to sell this story to my department  if i dont theyre coming after me trust me  its better this way come on come on  all right  ill go get shep  get your guy on the phone tell him to sit tight  i dont want this situation any worse than it already is  you all right mike  you still pack a pretty good punch  the good news is  santoras planning on going back to the kid  fi followed their guy  theyre holed up on an island off the causeway  and the bad news  santora wants to kill you first  i convinced him to do it with my gun  up on the side of the road make it look like you were trying to get away   how far is the road  a couple hundred yards   i guess itll have to do  if there was any other way  there isnt  all right when you get free  take his car and head to the causeway ill get you the address  good luck mikey  lets take a walk  listen listen you dont want to do this  this i could tell you more  i could tell you about flowers and the plan   you dont want to do this  i know plenty already  i mean why shut this down theres money to be made here man  i could help you we could split it 5050  i dont want to die man please  please im begging you  he got away  what the hell are you talking about   wheres my gun  he took it  hes got my gun we got to find him now   could he go to meet up with jimmy  i dont know maybe   you told him to stay put with the kid  yeah  wheres the house  we dont have time for this wheres the house   hibiscus island  what address  i got to know they got my gun  look if i go down for this so do you  what are you doing  theyve security office on the island  ill ask if theyve seen him  this is officer finley miami pd  id like to know if youve seen anyone go to 1313 prospect street  theres someone going there right now  i got the address  people underestimate the tactical importance of tv  in urban warfare  guard dutys boring and a ballgame passes the time  better than say looking for intruders  more battles have been decided by pennant races than people imagine  were gonna take you back to your mom and dad okay  the junkies here  we do him and jimmy first then the kid  you cut through the backyard ill cover you from the front  have fun in there you son of a bitch  look whos here   you thought you could steal from me  what do you say  wheres the kid i said wheres the kid   i dont know he was just there  i know what you did  i know youre flowers i know everything  what are you talking about get that thing out of my face  put it down now you picked the wrong guy to doublecross  you sold me out to a junkie  its always best to have business arguments unarmed  when tempers are high and everyones got a gun  you never know whats going to set someone off   i dont know what to say  you dont have to say anything  think about leaving miami imagine if his friends come looking  we werent planning to be weve talked about making a fresh start  somewhere else together  thank you for everything  you ready  a fresh start together   kind of inspiring dont you think  id settle for staying out of jail  come on we got a date  with the storage unit  when a front door is being watched  your best option oftentimes is just to make a back door  if you dont mind getting damp  a water saw is a great tool for the job  it will cut through the wall much more quietly than a metal saw  and wont ignite anything flammable that happens to be lying around  detective would you like to come in i have some more receipts  i finally did get a look at that storage unit that didnt belong to you  find anything interesting  i found a hole in the back of the wall and a puddle of water inside  the heavy rains the other night must have done some funny things  this isnt over   did you make this  you like it  i wanted this to be special so i cooked  its good   happy birthday mike  beer a fivepack   thanks  its imported  its supposed to be brewed by some monks in belgium  its really good or so i heard   would you like some  yeah thanks  its kind of pricy but i figured only the best for you   would you like a bottle opener  no i got one thanks   i never leave home without it  sam you need a bottle opener  why dont i show you where it is   its a bayonet  used during war for close fighting   thanks  well someone once told me  that caring for you is like trench warfare  so i thought you should arm yourself
