                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line   until you figure out who burned you youre not going anywhere  when you have to get information about an enemy position you have a choice  you can watch from a distance   slow and safe  or you can go inside and take a look   quick but potentially fatal  mike im just saying  for you to go waltzing in there   we dont have enough intel  the people who burned me got a specialized rifle for a sniper  got him an access card for this building  and sent him to the conference room on the fourth floor  thats a fair amount of intel  yeah but we dont know what he was doing in there  you might be walking into a hornets nest  chance i got to take  what has he been doing since he was last here  well my fed buddys been tracking his credit card  your snipers in daytona hitting all the strip clubs  i mean mike do you think hes just blowing off steam before he starts shooting  could be  you sure you want to do this  they killed someone for this badge and i went to a lot of trouble to steal it  shame not to use it  hey mike what are you seeing up there   a mastermind petting a persian cat  no the floors empty  empty well why were they so hot to get their sniper in there  who knows  hang on a sec  most people think snipers like to shoot from ledges  the fact is the best sniper position is inside a room through an open window  it hides the shooter masks the report of a supersonic round  and makes the muzzle flash impossible to see  its a sniper perch  hes scouting a perch sam  well whats he gonna shoot at mike  the nearest building is like miles away and the freeways not an issue  i think i found his target  mike  you better scoot your burnnotice lady just showed up  carla  burnnotice lady  yeah your overseer boss manager whatever get out of there  good news mikey  i just planted a tracker on carlas bike  you had a tracker on you  always be prepared  navy seal motto  thats boy scouts  mike are you gonna argue with the man who just planted a tracker on your handler  sam i could kiss you  get in line     sam  hey mikey  to surveillance  were you careful booking this place  yeah dont worry carlas not gonna know were watching  costs a few bucks but were clean trust me  you got to love it when you tail someone to a place that makes a good mojito  where is she now  first chair all the way at the end  tell me about carla  well shes got a hell of a breaststroke mike  i mean the woman can swim shes a machine  good to know  what about the assassination shes planning  anything on that  if the snipers hitting someone on the ferry  you re gonna have to ask tall blonde and evil down there  who the target is cause theres no passenger list and you got to buy a ticket on the day  how about her security  not much here at the hotel  i dont think she wants to draw attention  so ive been working my sources and checking on her room  oh mike um did i mention that the drinks here are just a little bit pricey  that should do it  better not let carla catch you with that access card  you may need it later  its always a challenge hiding something sensitive that you might need quickly  any hiding place involves a tradeoff between security and access  hiding something in the sewer main under your floor  and its secure but good luck getting to it  hide something in your sock drawer and its easy to get to but hard to secure  the best hiding places are easy to get to but tough to find  the doityourself versions are known in the spy trade as slicks   easy to slip something in easy to slide it out  fiona  and campbell  michael its good to see you again  got you a uh yogurt drink  fiona said youd like it  campbell fionas boyfriend  thank you  is this a social call  oh i think weve socialized enough for one day  its purely business tell him  campbell yesterday a call came in about a guy passed out on the street  and my ambulance was the first one on the scene  it was crazy i mean somebody had worked this guy over  took a lot of blows to the stomach area  he was coughing up blood  id say this guys in real trouble  i was kind of hoping maybe you and fiona could talk to him  i know you guys help people  yeah um now is uh  well the timing couldnt be worse  michael campbell almost got fired helping us with our last job  its okay fiona i know its a lot to ask  if michaels too busy  ill handle it myself  fi stop  you shouldntdo this job alone   so youre

headhunter  he seemed like a good guy  but when he started askingabout security procedures  i got suspicious and i stoppedreturning his calls  a few days later my best friend  a guythat ive known since i was 10  they saidhe committed suicide  i knew it wasnt true  it didnt make any sense  and then i got a callfrom lesher  and he said that more peoplewill die if i dont cooperate  or if i call the police   theyre planning a kidnapping  yeah  theyre going after thisvenezuelan family the arroyos  oil money i think  wheneverthey come to miami they hire a bodyguardfor each of the family members

loan out on the house  okay look broi know what youre thinking  you let mom take a loan outon the house  he didnt let me do anything i wanted to help him  mom what if if he screws it up  nate im just saying nate  no i know what you were saying ii deserve that  enjoy the champagne  nate workedreally hard on this  couldnt you support hima little  mom given his track recordif things go wrong   well its off toa really good start michael  thanks a lot  guess ill let myself out  its all right henry theres no one around  lesher called again  he wants those files  and youregoing to give them to him  hes going togo through the files and make you choosea guard for isabella that he thinkshe can control  and its you  how do you knowhell pick you  ive kind of done this thingbefore henry  a recently divorced alcoholicwith money problems   hell open my file and thinkits christmas morning  and then  then i let slip some informationthat convinces him this kidnappingisnt worth the trouble  is there anything i can do  just play ball  its my job to make himwalk away from the game  fiona he looksa little jittery  you thinkhell hold it together  fear isthe greatest motivator  oh i dont knowabout that  look at why youre doing this  what does that mean  well you wantedto protect me  what are you doing it for  i wantedto make campbell happy  here we go that must be lesher  lesher hidnapper  and the muscle  the muscle  he better go for it  if i did all that paperworkfor nothing im gonna shoot someone  when an operative recruits someone he lets the target make the first move  hell dress like him drink like him move like him but he wont talk to him  hell wait to be approached  im not sayingshe deserved nothing but half  i mean if id knownwe were gonna get divorced  i would have had hercome to the office and do half my jobknow what im saying  besides after i pay a lawyerand get a new place what am i left with   squat  exactly  you want to heara funny story about my divorce   sure  me too  another round on me  to my friendat the end of the bar  im not askingfor too much okay    um well just you knowjust come back thats allim asking but  just a wife who doesnt justget on my ass about you know  stop drinking all the time come to church all the time for christs sake  you know a decent joba decent paycheck  is thattoo much to ask for  so you never told me  what exactly do you do brad  special forces you knowofficer  15 years  now i carry a tennis bagfor a spoiled little rich girl  i work for a bodyguard company  its a joke how about you  well its not too farfrom your line of work  i do security testing  ah what a coincidence you exmilitary  i spent some timein the service yeah  you should really think aboutcoming into my side of the biz  nah its all just bs you know  think about it  i mean what kind of trainingdo they do at your company  when selling yourself as a traitor you cant be too eager  a good op will walk away from a recruitment that seems to good to be true  thats confidential why are youasking me these questions  im sorry  if i want tooffer you a job i should just come outand say so  i just think its a shameto see a man with your talents wasted on a jobthats beneath him  if youre interestedgive me a call tomorrow  surveillance is the leading cause of weight gain among operatives  in a job thats equal parts boredom and tension  eating is a way to pass time and calm nerves  whatever carlas up to mikeits something big  lots of meetings internationaltypes nobody we know  if you want to get in her roomnow would be the time  sure ill just uhteleport myself over there  or do you havea better suggestion  you could usethis master key  i cozied upto the housekeeping manager  mike the stuff i had to doto get that you dont evenwant to know  whatever you had to doit was worth it  whats the security likein carlas room  shes got a facialrecognitioncomputer at the door  anybody unauthorizedsets off an alarm  thats the roomservice guy  hes authorized  call me if carla makes a moveand order yourself some dessert you earned it  im all over it buddy  it doesnt have to be foodright  facialrecognition systems are often used to replace human guards since theyre cheap  they dont sleep and they cant be bribed  they have a big weakness though  unlike guards computers cant tell the difference between a photocopy of a face and a face  when you search a spys room you dont waste time checking the safe  you have to assume theyre as creative as you are  slicks come in all shapes and sizes  yeah sam  carlas meetings wrapping upmike time to go find anything  we hit the jackpot  looks like you found carlas whole file onthis operation mikey  yeah but the nameof the snipers target is not in there  well maybethe supreme overlords havent given itto her yet  so if you get itbefore carla that might be enoughto get you off the blacklist  worth a try  well theres somefamiliar faces in here   you know who this is  no  maybe hes another operative  i thinkwere getting close mikey  well i got to get backto the hotel  ill let you knowif she makes a move  thanks sam  hey go easy on the mojitos  they always go easy on me  the arroyo family

securitytonight  and hes not gonna likewhat he hears  theres an art to drinking without getting drunk  start with a lot of ice to dilute the alcohol  order a new round before youre done so your halffull drink gets taken away  and of course spill  no  no worries i got it  ou want to talk business lets talk business  yeah we deal with highend clients  were always looking for good people like

of you know amanda  she kicked me outof staying there   can you  yeah no problem no problem  yeah all right  a cover id that involves drinking comes with a price  but the tactical advantages make the hangover worth it  howd it gowith lesher  told him about the securityand i got a bug in his car  time for a demonstrationof isabellas airtight detail  sams in the buick whos the other memberof our little team  i was thinking aboutcalling nate  i was hoping you couldmonitor the bug from here  nate  youre asking your brotherfor help on the job  im tryingto be supportive  fi is thatmy last yogurt

me to do  thats it just sit thereand dont smile  not exactly what i expectedfor my first job  its more important than takingpeople to the airport trust me  you know what  im gonna frame this  well maybe im gonnabreak this up into smaller bills and frame one of them  but uh  thanks mike  operatives do a lot of bodyguard work  on any given day the average commando is more likely to be watching a vipwalk his dog  than engaging the enemy in battle  not glamorous but part of the job  youre  oh uh no espaol  thanks for drive me  no problem no uh problemo  so serious   how was tennis  fine  whats wrong fi  im listening to the bugin leshers car  they were impressedwith the extra security but this is more thana kidnapping for money listen  it doesnt matter it does matter  they got both sides of the street coveredthe plan was that   i know what the plan was  but the people that paid for this job have a multinational oil concession riding on us getting that girl  we have to find a way  sounds like lesherneeds a little more convincing  michaelyou dont have to   fiwe both know i have to  did you see mein action today   yeah i saw you  yeah andhow many others  i mean you could send adelta force team after that kid  and you wouldnt evenscratch her tennis racket  i meanits a waste of my time   uh when can istart with you  yeah we need to talk  can we starttalking about salary  cause if

just go home its over  blowing an operation is a delicate business  you have to convince your opponent to abandon his plans  make a case that the smart move is to just pack up and go home  problem is even when you do your job well people dont always go with the smart move  lesher sent you to kill medidnt he  well then you needto make a phone call  youre gonna tell himyou did the job but you got hurt and youhad to go to the hospital  then youre gonna spenda little time in your trunk  how does that sound hold that thought  yeah  michael its henry  i just got a call from lesher  the kidnappings

girl  and you will be judged  i dont knowwhat i would have done if you hadnt respondedto that 911 call  thank you really  they did all the heavy liftingso  well whoever lesherwas working for must have beenpretty disappointed  i heard he tripped and fellon a knife last night in jail  he fell on a knife  youre safe henry  but id keep your mouth shutabout all of this  no problem the familys keeping thisreally quiet  theyre really stepping upthe security  oh isabella  shes been askingwhy youre not around anymore  what do i tell her  tell her bradthe security guard had to take some time offfor some personal issues  so what do you thinkof campbell you still havent told me  why is it so important whati think about your boyfriend  cause i want youto like him  im happythat he makes you happy  give me a real answer michael saved by the phone  yeah ma  madeline michaelwhat is going on  what do you mean whats wrong  there are cops here and theyrearresting your brother  ma i didnt do anything i swear tell him  they said its abouthis limo company tthat iits some kindof a front   laundering moneyor something its ridiculous  tell himnot to say anything  michael i got a callfrom some woman  aand she said that that nate is in serious trouble  i could lose my house  and  and she saidmichael to tell you that you should stay outof other peoples business  her name wasum carla  im gonna call you back  sam is carla there  just aboutto call you brother  somethings up shes on the move  i need a ride  well theresour mystery operative  any ideawhats going on sam  no she just checked outof the hotel and came over here thats it  just say the word michael i have a nice riflein the trunk of my car  tempting but sinceshes the only one who knows whats going oni might want to keep her alive  theres a reason they call the spy trade the hall of mirrors  you can never know for sure whether youre in control or youre being played  but if you do it long enough you learn to trust your instincts  its a setup   what  what are you saying  she knows were here  shes gonna have her snipertake his target out now  she wants me here watchingwhen it happens  how can you be sure mike  i cant but its howi would do it  last ferrys in an hour  if i can get homeand get that access card i can get to the sniperbefore he takes his shot  sounds good ill get to his house see ifi can catch him there  still leaves me freeto shoot carla  fi  just saying  as soon as i leavetheyll be on me can you  yes i can  unlike cars motorcycles dont have much of an aftermarket in stolen parts  so antitheft measures are outdated and easy to get around  the steering lock on a smaller bike breaks fairly easily  then its just a matter of getting away  go  when youre tailed by multiple vehicles youre at a disadvantage  they can flank you take alternate routes box you in  it helps to have a team of youre own  the electronic stability program was originally developed  to help keep cars from sliding on icy roads  but its a great tool for the precision driver  when you need to slide you can simply turn it off  and turn it on again when you need to maneuver  a semi has about 4 feet of clearance under it  sliding beneath it on a motorcycle is possible but risky  too low and the pavement will grind you to a pulp  too high and any part of your body that hits the trailer will no longer be part of your body  yeah sam  im home did you make itto the snipers house  yeah i gotsome news mikey the snipers dead  deadwhy would anyone   i dont knowbut its pretty nasty  something is very wrong  i dont getwhats going on  they went to a lot of troubleto put this guy in place  slow down just tell me  what happened sam how  someone boobytrappedhis front door mike  they blew him up    to be continued
