                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burnedyouve got nothing  no cashno creditno job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you   a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  familytoo  heyis that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your helpmichael  bottom line  until you figure out who burned youyoure not going anywhere  previously on burn notice  give us the man who killed our operatives  and you and i can have a little chat about your future  you didnt tell her it was victordid you  the man has tried to kill you twice  hes the one enemy i know carla has  id like to at least talk to him before i turn him in  you tell carla someone else went after her operativesand were friends  i have questionsand i have a feeling you can answer them  wellthats not on the menu  im asking for answers    the most dangerous time in any operation is just as everythings coming together  you never know whether youre about to get a pat on the back or a bullet to the back of the head  of coursetheres not much you can do but act like everythings fine  hellomichael  care for a chocolatecovered pomegranate seed  khava tea  you drove all the way out here to offer me a snack im touched  its a taste of your former life  good old days before the burn notice  when michael westen was just a carefree spy in the deserts of afghanistan  you knowi was like you oncemichael lived for the job  eventuallyi discovered the job doesnt love you back   you got burned  yes  i was angry at first  then i found i didnt miss it  you might find the same thingmichael  and if i want my life back  well thats why im here  anythings possible if you do your job  im working on it you know me  this is seriousmichael managements not happy  theyll be in town shortly to make sure everythings resolved  these are not people to be trifled withmichaelbelieve me  ill do my bestthen  rememberthere are worse things than being blacklisted  ohi know i could be this guy  heymikey you sure you werent followed  sure as i can be  unless shes got an invisible helicopteri think were fine  yeahi wouldnt put it past her  she needs to back off if im gonna solve her problem  from what i can tellshe really needs me to solve the problem  lets see how our guest is doing  last i checkedhe was sleeping  its kind of tough to sleep when youre cabletied to a chair  how longs he been in there alone  a few hours you said not to open the door  whats in that  ohbeanbag rounds  at this rangeitll break a few ribs  nice place  i stayed in a bed and breakfast like this once  glad you like it  when youre dealing with a trained operativeyou have to assume theyre as good as you are  if youd have cut through your restraints given a few hours alonechances are he had the same idea  thats enough roughhousingboys  its always fun until someone gets hurt   sonow were cozy what shall we talk about  why dont we start with why you tried to blow me up  you make it sound so personal  i was removing operatives from the field you were cogs in a machine  i just hit that machine with a baseball bat  whyd you hit the machinethen  you knownot to be rudebut id just as soon skip to the end here  the end  wellif theres one thing everyone knows about michael westenits that he wants his job back  and here i sityour shot at getting that  nowit doesnt take an intelligence analyst to see how this ends  sowake me when carla gets here  or shoot me now and save everyone some time  you went after carlas organization why  why does it matter  nothing i say will change the fact that im your ticket out  why is your curiosity more important than my nap  youre out of moves herevictor  your only shot here is to trust me  hmmtrust you just like that  you have nothing to lose and everything to gain  i was cia  my family was stationed with me in mexico city an op went badand  i lost my wife and son  the burn notice went out the same day  i was out on my assmy family was deadnot even enough money for a bus ticket home  and then you got a call from carla  welli was more enthusiastic about the opportunity than you were  it was a way back ina way to get payback  wellit took me some timebut i found what i was looking for  and the punch linethe reallyreally funny part isit was carla  she had my family killed as part of my recruitment  im sorry  by that timei was inside  i was an effective operative  and i figuredheywhile im herewhy not gut the entire organization  welli took my shot  and here we are  carla doesnt know youre here  if youre telling the truthmaybe we can work on this together  ive got a boat docked out at the end of randall key  the cabin is boobytrapped with a claymore  check under the bed  if you want proofthats the best i can do  youre trusting him  how many times does someone have to try to kill you before hes crossed the line  we came to an understanding  you knowwhen i was a kidi adopted a dog that i found  he had these big eyesand i used to rub his bellyand i thought we had something special   right up until he bit a chunk out of me  ill show you the scar if youd like   ill be carefulsam  im coming with you  give him some air see what else you can get out of him  rub his belly if you need to  nice work  victor should probably teacha class or something  clear  he said to checkunder the bed  spam and capn crunch  no wonder hes so erratic  spies are supposed toravel light with nothing that could identify them  some dobut most find that staying sane requires staying connected to something  that reminds them why they do what they do  pictures are particularly dangerous to carryunless the people in them are already dead  michaelhis little boywas only 4  who knew you couldfeel this bad for a psychopathon the edge of sanity  people dont get thereon their ownfi  being under carlas thumbits a strain  wellyouve doneall

whos coming after youyou cant see where youre going  sometimes you just have to trust your gut  these guys are pretty good  looks like they pulled out all the stops for us  im flattered  in a firefight on the roadyouve got a few options  without something highcaliber  youre not going to be able to penetrate the radiator or the firewall behind it  that leaves two options   the windshield or ricocheting bullets off the ground up through the undercarriage  which is one of the leastreinforced parts of the car  for sheer panicits hard to beat bullets coming up from the floorboards  is that brake fluid  polyethylene glycols not gonna burn fastenough to do anything  it will when its mixedwith chlorine dioxide and some other stuff  someones been tothe chemical storei see  i like you have i

rightsetting up a perimeterand waiting for backup  wellwe should getsome backup of our own  careful with that phone chances areits a party line now  pleasure doing businesswith you say hi to paco   bonjour  fi  michaelyou are not gonnabelieve the deal i got today  i am better at buying gunsthan i am at buying shoesand i am really goodat buying shoes   fiona glenanne  what  remember that drive

ohthis is gettingbetter and better  im not getting michaelor fiona  they probably ditchedthe phones   should i call the police  no  thatll make it waytoo easy for them  cops take us to the stationthey know where we areand they knowthat we are unarmed  so what do we do just sit here and wait  notheyre gonnaget more guys  we got to create a distractionand get them out of here  but the thing istheyre all over my carand theres no way to getyour car out of the garage  we could borrowmrs reynolds car  she lives overthe back fenceand i have the keyin case of emergency  back fencehuh that could work  madelinethink you could findsome christmas lights  when youre outmanned and outgunnedthe key is to appear bigger and stronger than you are  take your enemys expectations and turn them against him  to make a goodsized fireball without a lot of ordnance  you need a powder with a high surfaceareatomass ratio  nondairy creamer mixed with gunpowder works nicely  i could probably put twoor three of them downget one of their gunson the way out  were trying to keepthe body count a little bit lowerthan that  this isnt just about gettingout of a parking garage we might have a shotright now  ive worked with carlafor a long time now  ive put togethera little insurance policy in case she ever found outwhat i was up to   insurance  yeahshe likes her ops teamsfor personal errands  making extra cashpaybackthat kind of thing  nowive got a fileat a safe house in town nowwe get that  we can blackmail our wayto safety  yeahitsa distant second to dousing her in keroseneand lighting a match  but under the circumstancesitll have to do  noware we ready to use thisor what  i think we can get furtherwith this lets go  a security perimeter is like a defensive line in football  youve got a couple of options  you can try to punch through the line with brute force  or you can soften it up with a little misdirection  here they come  look out  get out of the way  im liking your planless and less  everythings fineas longas we keep them behind us   fine  relatively fine  come onmichael  where did you meet her  blackmail thats the idea  were doing all this so we can throw somepaperwork at carla  its the smart play here were outgunned  well get bigger guns  i cant believewhat im hearing  i saw what she did to youand your family  if the file is so greatthen why didnt youuse it before  this isnt just about her  i want the guyswho call the shots  the file was just in caseenough to force her to back off  if this was just about puttinga bullet in carlait would have been overa long time ago  stillputting a bullet in carlasounds awfully good  if it comes to thatyoull have to get in line  yeahabout that file  your safe house not so safe  shes good i was three deepwith fake safe houses trying to keep this placefrom her  sometimes i wishshed get a hobby  which room is it in  its not in a room its on the utility pole  a fake utility box isnt a bad hiding place  ohnice  people dont touch things labeled high voltage  repair crews leave them alonetoo  theyre not realso they never need servicing  too bad carlassurveillance is parked rightin front of it  two carsfour guys think we can handle it  we each shoot oneand rochambeau for the other  yeahwe dont knowits carlas guys  it could be atffbiworking off of bad intel  they could becompletely innocent  ohplease no ones completely innocent  is that what you told yourselfwhen you tried to kill me  lets go  thanks for calling onstar  yesi need directionsto the closest hardware store  id like to avoidmajor intersections and government buildings  i found a hardware store on siebert avenue would you like me to direct you  yesplease  okay the partys starting   you ready  does it matter  not really  do you think they saw us  notheyre busywith the team out front were probably good to go  if i knewthat baby was herei would have gotten usout of there a lot faster   turn this way  right down here  why is it a shortcutwhere were going  im telling youi think the idea sucks just pull over in here   whatwhere right here  now yes   why are we pulling over here  dont ask questions just do itplease  madelineyou saw what happenedback thereright  yeahi did  you really think the best useof your time is a threehour driveto orlando   yeah do you have a better idea  yeahi do  okayfine welllets hear your plan  i take care of myselfand you go save my son  they sent men to mewith gunssam  god knows whatthey sent to him  listenthe one thing a woman my age can doin miami is blend in  if they can pick me out of10000 other  i guess im done forhuh  can you find him  maybe we got a few rally pointsaround miami we use for emergencies  but come onmadeline are you sure  he needs youmore than i dosam just goplease  byesam  mikes gonna kill me  one of the most common cover i d s for a spy is service personnel  of courseanyone who works in intelligence knows to check service personnel  so a quick phone call to the gas companyand youve created the perfect distraction  the active ingredient in pepper spray is the chemical capsaicin  mix the birdseed with some alcohol and oilpressurize it in a paint sprayer with co2  and you have a homemade pepper grenade  a few nails in the right places on a car door blocks the lever bar  making it impossible to openand leaving you free to do pretty much whatever you want  i could see why carlawouldnt want this out there  shed send a blackops teamto deal with a parking ticket  pretty much  the higherups stay awayfrom most operations  they have two rules  dontscrew upand dont get caught  they dont get involved unlessthings go veryvery wrong  wellid saythis situation qualifies  carla has a lot of enemiesfrom her spook daysand shes made more since  and then she made the mistakeof vouching for youbig guy  those files should bemore than enough to earn hera retirement bullet  carlas entire work history this is pretty damning stuff  you think you can playthis card  when we get backto my boative got the codes andcomm lines to go above her head  if she knows i can getto them with thisthen shellback off  fast  then we get out of townmaybe to cuba  fabulous great musiclots of sexy unemployed men  fican i talk to youfor a sec  im not invited to cuba  theyre gonna follow uswith everything they have  i need you to find samand help him protect my family  cant sam do iton his own  i know you dont liketo hear thisbut you and samare a good team   and do you think i  the car  i expect you to bring it backclean with a full tank capisce  i can do that  its not goodbye its just in case  and that is to remind youto be careful  looks like no ones around  well scout the perimeter if its clearwell go in  all this timeyou neverfound out who burned you  who cares name in a file  behind thatanother name  you know howthese things start someone runs an operationoff the books  its supposed to bea onetime thingbut when its overtheres power to be had  takes on a life of its own  its the organizationnot some guy  why me  dont tell me my namewas picked out of some hat  it was no secretyou were good at your job  the machine wanted youso it took you  now youre part of it and im part of it  but thats what were tryingto destroy heresport  ahthere you are  i havent been able to getanybody on the phone for ages  wheres mikey is he here  no he decided to go on a tripto cuba with victor  theyre going after carlawith documents  what are wesupposed to do  i promised him id help youprotect the family  welli promised madelineid help protect mike  so i guessthe question is  which promise do we keep  looks like were all clear  we have enough fuelto make it to the islandas long as we dont have to dotoo much detouring on the way  you start the engines ill cast off  carla  bad day fora cruisemichael  a veryvery bad day  you think so  and here i was hopingyou came to see us off  i took the precaution of havingthe local marinas searched when i lost contactwith victor  seemed like a long shot  hated to thinkmy two favorite operatives might be making nastylittle plans together  sorry to disappoint you  wellnot to spoil the funbut the boats wired with c4  cant have you leavingbefore we have a chat  great come on board lets talk  im fine herethanks  michaelmanagements on the way  theyre gonna want to knowwhat happened here  any story i tell themhas to begin with victors dead body  afraid of what he might shareabout your history together  not important whats important is thatthis story needs a hero  it could be you  kill him or send him outand ill do it  if you leave me no alternativetheres always the c4  you want to explain blowing upyour entire team  doesnt speak wellfor your management skills  yeahwellid haveto explain two dead bodies youd have to beone of them  just end thismichael hes a killer you know that   hes what you made him  time is upmichael  finish it offor i will finish it for you  finally  looki know you wantto savor the momentbut we got to getout of here  looks like whoevers in thatchopper brought some backup  standing by for clearance secure your perimeter  move it  theyre heading into the trees  clear for touchdown  we got to talkbig guy  you have to get out there and get on top of thisbefore her body cools  take the file tell them when you found mei turned on carla  you lured her herehad your team take her outand then

take me apart  you know it hasto be like this  it was good playingwith yousport  now you get out  get out while you can  heythere took you guys long enough  put down the gun  want to get thoseout of my face  could have usedyou guys earlier  nothis is for the big guy    good luckmike  in intelligence workyour most important tool   more important than any combat techniqueany technical skill   is your ability to twist the facts of a situation to your own advantage  the worse the facts arethe more youve got to sell it  well  two rogue operativesin one day lucky us  youre welcome you knowi think
