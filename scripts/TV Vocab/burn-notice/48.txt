                i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  spies spend la  but they dont usually end up  in the most desirable destinations  youre much more likely to find yourself  visiting a rebel camp in the philippine jungle  or a hidden bunker in the mountains of pakistan  than lounging beachside in the bahamas  but even when you do find yourself  in a vacation paradise its still all about business  michael i cant believe  i waited this long to come to the bahamas  i am at the loveliest little beach bar  youre at a bar  what happened to identifying a dead body at the morgue  oh relax  jesse and i are hard at work  i doubt the autopsy report  was hidden under a keg of red stripe  verifying the identity of a dead weapons runner  is not the vacation a girl dreams of  you know dont get mad if i have a little fun  fi jesses contact wasnt just a weapons runner  i know  he worked for whoever is behind  all this international nastiness that youre trying to stop  i just spent two hours on a boat  with jesse singing the same old song  and hes even more worked up about it than you are  lucky for both of you i met ty   the delightful coroners assistant  whos about to loan me his keys  we call this the love boat  oh no you cant  like magicians pickpockets rely on misdirection  you like it  i like it  whether youre pulling keys out of a pocket  or a rabbit out of a hat  its all about big distractions  i cant stop  very good  you ready to go sweetbread  excuse me oh come now  youve been eyeing me since you walked in  you dont think i seen you flirting with me  time to dance  oh no easy girl dont be a tease  yo let her go  why you want a confrontation  back away before you get clapped man  what boy you back up  no no no dont hurt him  break it up let him go  break it up  thats okay  times a tickin jesse  yeah im going as fast as i can fi  apparently this guys method of filing things is to not  jesse  wait hold on  yeah i got it  good because ty just walked in with a cop buddy  you need help making it out  nah getting by that guy will be a piece of cake  just leave me the car and go get the boat  keys are under the mat hotshot  spies dont always have a choice of hiding places  sometimes it comes down to taking whats available  but if you have to hide in  something thats designed to be airtight  you better hope the danger passes  before you run out of oxygen  i guess i forgot them  hey thats the guy  stop that guy  gun it  piece of cake huh just go  hey mikey  can we take your car mines running on e  sure sam whats up  oh were just gonna meet some friends   josh and lila wagner  is this a job  well youre gonna love em mike  they run this great little charity called help at home  they work with soldiers families  who were killed in combat  i volunteer all the time  last christmas i was sammy claus for the kids  thats really great of you yeah  yeah so this is a job  well its more like a consultation  i dont have all the details  but josh got caught up in a scam  he invested the charitys money  in a company called blue crest   just tiny amounts at first  all of a sudden he saw huge returns  hey youre a psychic  then after a while josh starts to think  how many more people he could help  if he just turned up the volume a little  he decides to go allin  and next thing you know moneys gone  sounds like the cops could consult on this  they tried it mike  once the cops got a look at the paper trail  they said it would take months to wade through  all i want you to do is just hear what the problem is  and point us in the right direction  and thats it yep  point you in the right direction and i go home  yeah thats it  and for that you get that warm fuzzy feeling  that comes with giving back  plus a free lunch mike  ribs  you got to try these ribs mike  josh marinates them in beer for two days  you hear what im talking two days  sam you have to go talk to josh  well thats why were here  no he left he went to go confront nick madison  ok oawhoa lila just slow down here  madison is the guy that took the money  the bank called and they said theres nothing we can do  the charitys getting shut down on monday  i didnt know it was that bad sam  it is and josh blames himself  iive never seen him this upset  hhe went to blue crest now  he wants to make madison give the money back  i just dont want him to make things worse  okay look dont worry about it  well find josh and make sure nothing bad happens  okay thank you  this is starting to feel like a job sam  relax mike  thisll take less than a day out of your busy life  and look until fi and jesse  find the real address for kassar  what else you got to do  yeah so if we could just have that address  wed be so grateful  its kind of an emergency  were uh  were leaving on our honeymoon cruise tomorrow  arent we sweet potato  oh thats so sweet  yeah well it would be if we were legally married  scotts divorce just came through  and his exwifes idiot lawyer  jeremiah kassar  he sent us copies of the paperwork  and we need the originals baby  i know i know i know  i got to track this guy down today  we need a home address  oh i see  whats that  our confidentiality policy  theres no way im giving you that address  but my parents  theyre flying in to see us off from new york  in the field you can never count on  your first approach being successful  you have to be ready to change tactics on the fly  spies learn to make lightningfast observations  and connect the dots just as quickly  little things like a family photo with no father  and a missing wedding ring  can tell you all you need to know  about a targets soft spot  or better yet their sore spot  you want to leave now or should i call the cops  you know what let it go tanya  were gonna have to get a court order  look the truth is jeremiah kassar is not a lawyer  hes a scumbag  were with an organization called deadbeat dad trackers  kassar is two years behind on his childsupport payments  two years two years  and we can go through official channels  but it takes a while you know  and when i think of his poor little kids i just  they deserve a decent pair of shoes  come on lets go  wait  how do you spell his name  josh is here all right thats his car  nice parking job  yeah well hes probably upset  i mean the gus on the verge of losing his lifes work here  sam how far will josh take this  i dont know why  i think he brought his gun  just give me the money back i dont have it  i swear to god i did not steal from you  liar hes not llying  please dont sshoot us mr wagner please  josh  you dont want to do this  sam what the hell are you doing here  im here to help just put that down who are you  my names michael im a friend of sams  listen lets talk about this no  theres a better way to handle this josh no no no  i tried better ways sam  iii went to the police i asked nicely  nothing happened nothing worked  i am out of options  we dont anybody to get hurt josh  we dont want you to go to jail  i deserve to go to jail  for trusting the charitys money to this thieving bastard  im not going anywhere understand me  not until i get every penny of that money back  josh buddy  i know that youre upset but   oh my god  im not your goddamn buddy  who called the cops  okay  get in there sam josh what are you doing  im locking them in the break room  leave sam this is my problem  mike josh is a good man i got to help him  if he wont give us that gun were gonna have to take it  miami police come out with your hands up  sam what are you doing  we need to get josh out of here so nobody gets hurt  this might not be the smart play mike  but im following my gut on this one  im helping josh  youre not changing my mind now move mike  how by making this a hostage situation come on sam  its already a hostage situation mike  no matter how you cut this deck josh is going to jail  i cant get his life back  but i can sure as hell make sure that madison  doesnt get rich robbing the children of dead veterans  fine if this is about the money  lets get everybody out then go after the money  yeah how look  theyre packing up shop mike  we let them walk now hes gonna be gone  before the cops take joshs mug shot  what the hell are you doing  how many times do i got to tell you leave  im not going anywhere  you want your money back youre gonna need some help  what no this is my fault  ill fix this  that would be the police  oh my god  theyre not answering lieutenant  this is lieutenant seth casey miami metro police  aryo veif you want this to work out  you will pick up the phone right now  we need to talk  wwhat do i do what do i say  mike this trains about to start moving real fast  its not too late for you to hop off  but im staying  in a hostage crisis  first contact with the police is critical  one wrong word from a hostagetaker  can be the difference between the start of negotiations  or the start of an armed assault  pick up the phone stop  he said i should  leave it  you sound like youre gonna jump off a bridge  you answer a phone like that  and youll have a swat team banging through the door  before you hang up  ill get it  i leave when you leave  hello hello  who am i speaking with  he says i cant answer any of your questions  he says that no will get hurt  as long you dont come any closer  ookay but tell him i cant help him  uunless i can talk to him  he says i got to go  wait wait wait dont hang up  tell him the lines open  anytime he wants to talk all he has to do is   you hung up on him  this is more of a less is more situation  im just buying time  okay josh were gonna help you get your money back  but only if you let us call the shots  are you sure about this you could go to jail  right now were just two friends trying to end this peacefully  as long as it stays that way  mike and i can get your money back and stay out of jail  deal deal  josh  sorry josh cant have anybody getting shot by accident  no bullets  i was just trying to scare them  id say you pulled that off  find out who works in that office  see who these cars belong to  im already on it  no phone no internet no ac  a little time in the sauna and hell want to talk  what do we do now  now we separate nick and patty and get some answers  i got dibs on nick  he wont be able to talk with you choking him  ill start with nick you take patty  you okay  who are you again  names michael  im just a friend who doesnt want anybody to get hurt  i asked josh if i could talk to you  to me  hes the whack job running around  cracking people in the face with guns  ttell him to let me go  i tried that patty  i did everything i could  to walk him out of this building  but it looks like were gonna need your help  because see hes not leaving  until he gets his money back  i know mr wagner is upset  but he is blaming the wrong people  its like nick says  investing is a risk  you know youre everybodys best friend  as long as the cash is rolling in but the second   the second somebody takes a loss  guess who theyre pointing the finger at  is that fair is it my fault that the economy crashed  i am not judging you nick  i mean these are tough times  you get a little behind its hard to catch up  so maybe you move some money around  its not stealing its just buying time  but if you want to get out of here alive  then youre gonna have to come clean  what do you want me to do  tell me where the money is  we didnt steal any money  do you know why josh snapped patty  because innocent families   and im talking widows and little kids   are gonna be out on the street  do you know why  because your boss looted his charity  and you helped him do it  that is a lie  nick would never do anything like that  youre talking about a man who was in tears  when he had to lay off his staff  he felt so bad hes been helping tom norris  with his mortgage the last few months   out of his own pocket  thats the nick madison i know  wwhat if i give you the computer uh password   the password to our computer system  you could access joshs client file  umtheres transaction records account statements  balance sheets  the whole nine  you could tell him that ii didnt do anything wrong  maybe hed believe you  heres the last printout  when interrogators hear a story without any holes  they know someones lying  only people who are afraid of getting caught take the time  to rehearse every detail and anticipate every question  so whats the good news  the same holds true for accounting  perfect books are like perfect alibis   it confirms youre dealing with a liar  but theres no way to prove it  theres nothing here  nick must have another set of books  they might not even be in the building  cant we just make him tell us  nicks smart enough to know he can keep denying everything  and wait for the cops  what about patty  shes innocent  nick conned her like everybody else  so what are you telling me  i did all this for nothing  im not gonna get the money back and im gonna go to jail  hang on patty mentioned a tom norris  norris yeah  he was the first guy i talked to  when i started investing with blue crest  patty said hes nicks righthand man  dollars to donuts he knows where that money is  talking to him might be the best move at this point  am i missing something because it sounds as though  you plan to talk to someone whos not here  relax josh we still have friends outside that can help  how are we gonna call him were not allowed to use the phone  we cant use that phone  dig up what you can on norris  put nick in the break room with patty  ill find a way to call out  in a hostage situation  its standard procedure for police to run cellphone jammers  and commandeer all the phone lines in your location  to make a call without a police operator  you need to access a line theyre not listening on  its a lot like stealing cable from your neighbor  if you can access a common wall and stretch the conduit  you can connect your phone to the unmonitored line next door  mike that password nick gave you  got me into norris personnel file  i got an address social security number   everything but his turnons and his turnoffs  how long is this gonna take  well itll go faster if youd give me a little room  hey trying to help  no michaels still not answering his phone  got a feeling michaels gonna want to be here  when we find out what kassar was up to  well sams favors tend to involve a lot of food and drink  they probably havent made it past the appetizers yet  well i guess hell have to miss out on all the fun  will it be starting anytime soon speedy  kassar wasnt taking any chances  hes got a doublecylinder dead bolt  which probably cost more than his car  this could take a minute  well we may not have a minute  here comes the welcoming committee  hey can i help you  hi hi  you know you may already have  did you send in your census questionnaire yet  were with the census bureau  your neighbor here didnt take advantage  of the selfaddressed stamped envelope we provided  which means we need to conduct an inperson interview  yeah  do you guys have ids  i hate to sound paranoid  but we had breakins around here recently  really that is a sha in this neighborhood  of course we have ids  yeah mine is in my briefcase which is in the car  in the car  hers  in the car  oh would that be the gray mustang thats parked out front   license number gc6j27  strangers make us a little nervous these days  oh its a uh supervisor we got to go sorry  aw hes a ballbuster we got to take this  okay  fi fi its me  perfect timing kassar has the nosy neighbor from hell  i think getting into this place isnt gonna be as easy   fi fi lets worry about that later  right now sam and i  are in the middle of a hostage situation  jesus michael  well tell me where you are and whos holding you  its more like were the hostagetakers  iill explain later  right now i need you to find someone  its michael get the details  hurry hurry up and open it  everything okay here josh  everythings great  i told josh if it helps  that i would show him our bank accounts  not just tthe companys but my own personal statements  trust me buddy  after you see these  you will know that we are all in the same boat  heres your proof  youre not trying to help us youre with him  so this is your show huh  well you had me going there for a minute mr good samaritan  i dont want anybody hurt  take him to the break room lets go come on  you know what this means dont you  youre all going to jail  armed kidnapping  unlawful confinement  madisons right   were looking at some serious jail time mike  youre not helping the mood sam  sorry i got you into this brother  im the one who decided to stay  funny  when i was 10 years old  i wanted an air rifle more than anything in the whole world  but my dad wouldnt get it for me  so i used my fivefinger discount  you got caught stealing a bb gun  mike it was a red ryder okay  my dad told the cops to lock me up for a couple hours   you know just to freak me out  i havent seen the inside of a jail cell since  its a little early to call it a day sam  we still got some cards to play  can i talk tocasey  is this nick or josh or michael westen  you still there  yeah i cant answer any questions  ii understand and i wont get you in trouble  but i need to ask a very important question  now if the answer is yes just say  i cant answer that  is everyone safe  i cant answer that  he says he wants a panel van   full tank of gas no side or back windows  he says hell hurt one of us if he doesnt see it in an hour  iid love to help  but i need a sign of good faith  i cant give him a van  until he releases one of the hostages  uhhuh okay  he says hell let one of us go as soon as he sees the van  we got good news  we have an escape vehicle coming  bad news  the negotiator knows im in here  ah geez mike  look maybe we should just pull the plug  ill talk to the cops tell em that we forced you to help  one problem at a time sam  first the money then the escape  lets just hope fi and jesse can get their hands on norris  making a cold approach to a scam artist is never ideal  they tend to assume  that a stranger showing up out of the blue  is either a cop or someone theyve ripped off  my man tommy how you been dude  listen we need to   either way you have to be ready for them to run  fortunately tactical support can make a foot chase  much more civilized  instead of relying on speed and endurance  all you need is a distraction and good timing  stings doesnt it  i want my lawyer  well that would help if we were cops  but we work for nick  what oh come on now tommy  you know those marks that come in just asking to get taken   who do you think is sending them to you huh  were here for our latest cut  wait a minute youre the crew from boca  why didnt you say something  you didnt give me a chance to  im sorry man i got spooked  whatd you come to me for anyway  i mean you know nick handles the payouts  you havent heard  get in the car  what the hell happened  place got raided a couple hours ago  nick gave us a headsup on his way out of town  said we can get our cut from you  he didnt even call me  focus on our money tom  i dont have your money  you have access to the account right  what account dont you get it  every time we wrap up a big score  nick converts the take to cash  hes got a floor safe in the conference room  you think hell fit  fi  lucky you michael youre sitting on the money  nick has a floor safe  under the carpet in the conference room  crack that puppy and come on out with your hands up  it wont be that ey fi  sam and i are on the hook for accomplices now  seriously michael  you have to stop doing favors for sam  have you requested a getaway vehicle  yeah its on the way  well youre gonna need a diversion  and judging from the police turnout  its gonna have to be a big one  fi if there ever was a time to pull out all the stops  this is it  michael  i never thought id hear you say those words  move over youre lying on my c4  hes got it in cash  its the last phase of scams like this  cash is almost impossible to trace  yeah especially when you use it to buy a milliondollar yacht  and sail into early retirement  looky there  well hello  son of a bitch  ill be right back  sam madisons not gonna give him the combination  yeah i know mike  were gonna have to find another way to get into that safe  i got this one mikey  hey  we found the safe you bastard now whats the combination  what safe what is he talking about oh you didnt know  yeah the money nick stole is in a floor safe right out there  is that true  well theres a safe yeah  but there is no money in it  well tthen give up the combination  show them its empty so we can go home  its not empty  our clients most sensitive information is in there  thats what these guys are really after  and when they get it theyll kill us  give me back the money give me back the money  back off josh  do you know whats stopping me from killing you right now  absolutely nothing  kidnapping or murder i die in prison either way  killing me wont get you the combination  okay  well just have to do this the hard way  what  what are you doing  i dont care if you burn me or electrocute me  or whatever it is youre thinking  relax nick i just want to borrow your toaster  floor safes are virtually impenetrable  as long as theyre in the floor  if you dont have a jackhammer to pry one out  you need to get creative  homemade shape charges will do the trick  but if you want to avoid  turning a standoff into a fullscale breach  youd better have a way to muffle the blast  hey mikey  our buddy nick has some topoftheline clubs  titanium  once a floor safe is out of the floor  it offers about as much protection as a piggy bank  looks like theres more than a million there  but you might want to count it just to make sure  oh my god  you said there was no money nick shut up  down down  its okay everythings okay sit down and shut up  i just need to take you to the break room all right  youre okay youre okay  you think they heard that  team 1 strike positions  copy that moving  fi this is not good  this is not good  michael whats up the cops are in place  theyre about to breach were not ready  forget about the diversion fi how much time do we have  well they already have entry teams in place  with breaching rounds  they still need perimeter support  youve got about five minutes at best  what are you gonna do  i wish i knew  hows it looking sam  fi said we got about five minutes before the breach  yeah probably less the cops are coming in  yeah all right so look heres what were gonna do  josh and i are gonna walk outside and give ourselves up  no sam i think we might be able   mike save it look this is not your call  if theres any chance to keep you out of jail  were gonna go for it i appreciate that sam  but i think we might be able to keep us all out of jail  the cops dont know who theyre coming in for  remember that parker thing in lima  lima no no mike  you know i like to roll the dice  but thats just taking it too far  what are you guys talking about  there was a bank heist in lima  supposedly the guys who did it  made themselves look like the victims  and they snuck out scotfree  if you can get patty on our side  and i can put this gun in nicks hand  we can do the same thing  mike youd have to do a lot more than get it in his hands  hes gonna have to be pointing that sucker  trust me  hes gonna be ready to shoot somebody  mike you know that storys just a myth  nobody believes they pulled it off  then i guess well be the first  patty  this is about to be over and i just want to let you know  that im sorry about what happened  i know josh is too  but you know nick caused all this  you think i dont know that  everything he told me was a lie  i dont even want to think about  the people whose lives i helped that man ruin  its not your fault he fooled everybody  thatll help me sleep tonight  well you know its not too late to do some good here  if we work together  you and josh can move on with your lives when this is over  what are you saying  well the cops are gonna ask who the bad guy is  im hoping we all have the same answer to that question  i can tell you right now i hate nick  prison would be too good for thatevil bastard  but he didnt hold a gun to my head and keep me here  you ask me you should all go to jail  youre wrong  i did this  not them me  and im sorry  i know it was wrong and i am willing to face the consequences  but ii just couldnt live with myself  knowing that those people were gonna lose their homes  and not be able to feed their kids  so youre gonna point the finger at somebody  point it at me  on your knees  wwhat are you doing  youre a smart guy  figure it out  please you cant kill me  why not  we found the money  we only need one hostage to walk out of here  we took a vote you won  wait think about it you dont want a murder rap  tttheyll never stop chasing you and   spies are trained to follow certain procedures  when holding someone at gunpoint  stand out of arms reach  keep your weight on your back foot  never take your eye off the target  unless you want your weapon taken  then you do exactly the opposite  sam what are you doing  i told you she couldnt witness this  aah back off  everybody over there move  this kind of sucks for you doesnt it buddy  you and your friends are going to jail  and im going to aruba  all right patty when we get outside  its probably best you keep your mouth shut  i can explain the cash and if you want to get cute  and mention something about a scam  theres nothing you can say i cant talk myself out of  so lets go  dont be stupid hero  i dont think you have what it takes to shoot somebody nick  are you crazy  youre a twobit scam artist nick  youre all talk  thats why you got into cons in the first place   so you wouldnt have to do a mans work  youre about to make the stupidest mistake of your life  now move  am i wrong nick youve got the guts  youve got the guts to pull the trigger  youre damn right i do  hes crazy dont shoot no  give me you hands  clear  show me your hands keep your hands up okay okay  howd it go with casey  just stuck to the story mike  its all on patty now is she with us  your guess is as good as mine brother  spies dont always make decisions  based on training experience  or potential success of a mission  sometimes its just a matter  of doing what you think is right  even if it means  putting your fate in the hands of a stranger   oh my god hes got a gun  please hurry please  thats you right  its okay  its all right patty  i know youve had a hard day  look im not trying to make it any harder or any longer  i have one simple question  whyd you make that call  josh wagner came in completely out of control  he said nick had stolen over a million dollars  from his charity  and he wanted it back  nick denied everything he said josh was crazy  and thats when josh pulled the gun  no  nick pulled the gun  hes a liar and a thief  and he knew he was about to be exposed  so he took us hostage  all of us  what are you doing  wait wait wait you cant do this  i was a hostage  westen i guess i should be thanking you  according to patty  if you and your buddy sam hadnt been around  things could have been a lot worse  i was just helping out a friend  got the departments file on you  says you have a fondness for explosives  it just so happens i got a safe  blown out of the floor in there  that was like that when we got here  youre telling me that nick blew up his own safe  maybe he forgot the combination  i dont think i could ever find the words to thank you guys  well those ribs were a good start  if you really want to thank us call our friend barry  its time you let a pro handle your finances  ill make sure of it  so mike uh i guess i owe you an apology  why you were right sam  you said it would take less than a day  i did didnt i  thats one longass day  hey sarge  nosy neighbor from hells a block and a half away  dudeyou got to go lighter on the rake  youre never gonna get the last pin  when was the last time you did this in the field  im saying windows closing super spy lets go  im in  freshpainted walls and steamcleaned carpets  are great if youre a realtor showing a vacant apartment  if youre a spy hoping to find a clue  theres nothing worse than a sparklingclean home  maybe kassars a neat freak  if you cant even find spare change in the sofa  chances are you wont find anything at all  youre wasting your time jesse hey  you want to go wait in the car be my guest all right  i didnt jump through all those hoops tracking this guy down  just to give up cause you say its a dead end  it might not be a dead end  spring cleaning like this takes time  chances are somebody was seen  you want to go talk to the neighborhood watchdog  all right  im letting you know right now  that chick is a stickler for ids  you just happened to bring that  i had a feeling we might need it  im sorry agent gordon  i dont think ill be of much help  uh youd be surprised miss  kendra  sometimes the little details make a big difference  whens the last time you saw mr kassar  i dont know a few days id say  and you havent noticed any uh suspicious people  or unfamiliar vehicles since hes been gone  like i said its been pretty quiet around here  sorry  thank you for your time kendra  whats up  says she doesnt know anything  yeah so whats that look for  there were pictures on the wall  but kendra wasnt in any of them  really  you check out her body it was pretty banging  stay with me somethings off here  no no no no thats what im saying  a woman with a physique like that  doesnt cover it up to go jogging  not in this heat  not unless shes hiding something  like scratches on her arms  she kills kassar  then sits on the place next door  to see if anyone comes knocking  every precaution you take to make something more secure  also makes it less accessible  concealing a highdensity tape cartridge behind drywall  is a great way to keep it from being found  she got away man  we just blew a chance to end this thing  but if you ever have to leave in a hurry  you cant expect to take it with you  i dont know jesse i think were just getting started
