michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  in any operation  whether its sneaking into an embassy  or collecting debts for a bookie  its important to lay out a plan

if he doesnt pay  michael we shove him into a trunk at gunpoint  do you have a better way to make 5 grand  the guy is a charmless sleazebag  no ones getting hurt perfect job  the perfect job fi

the door  and rock salt for the sleazebag and his friends  wish me luck    for many operations twoman teams are ideal   simple chain of command easy to delegate responsibility  and little room for confusion  does randall know youre coming  oh i want it to be a surprise  of course with a twoman team  theres not a lot of margin for error  all it takes is a cop showing up at the wrong moment  and the team ceases to exist  detective paxson good to see you  mr westen  youre a tough one to track down  you have a moment  another time would be better  what the hell are you doing here  im asking politely one last time for my clients 20 grand  i told you i aint got it  and im not paying  tell scotty if he wants it  he can come here and get it himself  you look preoccupied  im just picking up a

hey speaking of paxson  is this gonna be like a 24houradaytype deal  for now  and with our lifestyle  one of paxsons surprise visits could get someone killed  yeah i know  ive been trying to come up with something on her  problem is shes a good cop shes too clean to blackmail  we got to come up with a whole new angle here  okay wait a second is  is this a date  yesno  this is officially not a date  all righty can you bring us another spoon  youre not gonna eat that cherry are you  oh oh oh  when youre being followed by the police  its important to remember that having cops around  is a problem for criminals  but its an even bigger problem for a detective  trying to remain inconspicuous on a stakeout  waiting for a friend  im on police business  you need to get out of here now  im police business arent i  apparently im important enough to have a 24hour tail    this is a bad time  are you on a stakeout  are you waiting for someone to come home  do you need help with your cover id  i could be a fellow coffee lover  a boyfriend anything you need  im working another case here  a case ive spent eight months trying to crack  people are dying mr westen  i dont have time for these games  neither do i detective  im telling you were on the same side  ill determine what side youre on  you say were on the same side prove it to me  you know maybe you do need some proof  youre right we should talk later    sam i think i found a new angle  i need you to find out a little more  about another case paxsons working on  cookies  after your birthday cake ii decided id take up cooking  its supposed to be relaxing  so far im not convinced  uh let me know how that goes  hey mom if the cops out front ask  tell them ive run to the store  you know michael  id appreciate it if when you stopped by  it wasnt only to lose your police tail  mom please im supposed to meet sam  fine pick me up some eggs  and some cigarettes  sam hey mikey whats up with the new car   statistically  its the secondmost popular car in miami  it should make tailing me a little more challenging  so turns out there was a harassment complaint  filed against paxson a month ago  so youre not the only guy shes pursuing night and day  and i thought i was special  guys name is matheson  has a habit of ripping off drug dealers  left a trail of bodies across miami  oh the guy theyre putting in the ground right there   he was a neighbor at one of the heists  caught in the crossfire  does she have a case against matheson  no he covers his tracks like a pro  see paxson took a bunch of swings at him and missed  so he filed the harassment suit  da made her back off  so he doesnt even have to hide anymore  do we know where hes not hiding  we do  i think its time paxson got a little help with her case  we take matheson down the right way  shell have no choice but to get off my back  i dont think she wants our help  well shes getting it  he deserves some jail time and she deserves a break  right well you enjoy your new wheels  i got to get to my audit  you gonna be all right oh yeah i think so  the irs agents name is stacey conolly  time to deploy the sam axe arsenal  in any sort of operation  flirtation is always a tactical option  romance is a powerful force  and under the right circumstances  it can achieve your objective  of course not every circumstance is the right one  good afternoon mr axe  hi uh  stacey conolly irs  now this is a rather unfortunate place for an audit meeting  we have a lot of work to get through mr axe  and the uh calypso music is a distraction we do not need  two cosmos    i assume the pink beverages are an attempt to get me drunk  well its not gonna work because i do not drink mr axe   i audit  right  uh uh no actually these are uh these are for me  i see  well youll need them  i uh pulled your file its not pretty  its not pretty at all  now this is to inform you  that your pension checks are being held  theyll be released once we reconcile  every penny youve spent over the last three years  now i assume you brought your records  um no i just thought we would get acquainted    this is not a good start  this is not a good start at all  my office will contact you with a new appointment  remember mr axe the irs cant be charmed  with a fancy shirt smooth talk and pink drinks  the irs demands the truth okay  good day  michael this matheson creep  rips off drug dealers for a living  you sure this is the easiest way to get paxson off your back  the easiest way to get her off my back  is to answer her questions  this way it doesnt involve me going to jail  finding a way into a criminal organization  is about observing social dynamics  you start with the target  im like good luck   hey what are you doing im in the middle of a story  just leave my drink alone until im done talking okay    he seems lovely  watch your step kid   youre looking for just the right person to approach  people in the inner circle  are usually too tough to go after  anyone with real power is bound to be cautious  drivers and bodyguards are easier  but they usually dont have real access  you want someone with enough juice to be hungry for more  someone desperate to make a move  in short youre looking for a frustrated middle manager  what did i say tommy  how many times i got to tell you  no business talk here none  see thats your problem tommy   you dont think  tommy sorry yeah all right youre sorry  now get out of here    i think i found our guy  good cause we need to leave   hear those sirens those are for us  sam called  detective paxson found my car on 6th  shes going to start searching the area  if mr personality here sees you with paxson  itll be almost as bad as paxson seeing us with him  lets go    hey detective always a pleasure    i see you left your police escort  back at your mothers house  oh i knew i forgot something  let me be clear mr westen  every time you ditch your escort  you dig yourself a deeper hole  im taking you down  its just a matter of time  sam hold still mike  to the educated eye a prison tat tells a story   where you did time why you did time  and who you did it with  its a little like a job rsum for criminals     leave you two alone for a minute  im just giving mike his uh prison ink fi  i think i might have a second career here  sam checked out that guy tommy  the one matheson was smacking around  yeah tommy dantonio hes pretty smalltime  some counterfeit concert tickets some be  did two years in allendale for armed robbery  now hes pretty much a fixture at the dog track  when hes not hanging around with matheson  you think this guys gonna get us onto mathesons crew  hes the best we got  okay there you go thatll do it  i should charge you for those bricks thats art man  beautiful sam  ugh i got to take the over the roof and down the rain gutter exit  mind keeping them busy for me  sure thing mikey  every kid who ever went to a new school  knows the secret to fitting in   copy everyone else  spies do the same thing  tailor their wardrobe  their movement and their behavior  to imitate their targets   all the little things that say im your kind of guy  ah the freaking dogs

seafood    conolly thats another 383 in deductions  for business drinks  can i ask what business you were doing  i told you  its classified  the irs does not allow classified deductions mr axe  im disallowing this until the operation is made public  and then theres this  well you wanted documentation of my trip to the middle east  thats it thats all i got  got it off this guy who was in this group we were targeting  oh so you stole it  no i didnt steal it  the guy um he was done with it  so it was a gift its not a gift  there was this thing  and then the gun didnt have an owner anymore  im just gonna mark that down as a windfallincome  okay with those disallowed deductions  you have a tax deficiency of 17  over 25 the statute of limitations on your audit  is extended another three

please  ill let myself out  take care  i have a headache in my eye  you want another cookie  im good yeah  for a spy knowing how to follow  is at least as important as knowing how to lead  sensitive operations often depend on knowing  how hard to laugh at the bosss jokes  i got four more where those came from    michael hey whatd i tell you  whatd i tell you about this guy huh  he can hook us up right look at this  yeah milo here  couldnt get a table this good at burger king huh   tommy hey you just got to know how it works  we should order all right okay  its on me so uh whatever you like except the lobster  ugh lobster they look like bugs   come on brianna show some respect  dont talk about bugs and stuff here  milo just some people are not too comfortable in nice places  order what you like sweetheart  so milo says youre the guy to talk to in miami  about looking for work  it could be if you uh know how to use your head  we hit a few car dealers up north you know  id act like i was taking a car for a test drive  you know id grab the keys  brianna would strut her stuff you know keep them busy  then chuck here hed step in if things got rough  and the dealerships  they got wise so it was too hot  now were dying down here  see thats your problem you dont think big  last month i hit a checkcashing place in boca  walked away with 3 grand bam   man thats a hell of a score huh  and the one that got me pinched  was a credit union basically a bank  nearly walked away with 40 large  now thats the big leagues  i dont mean to be out of line  but i was thinking that maybe we could come on  to one of those jobs you know make some real money  well see what happens tonight  were gonna do a little job see how you do  i just smoke one a day since i got out of the joint  its called willpower you want one  uh no no thanks uh where we headed  dry cleaners up there were hitting it  i got the whole score worked out like clockwork  the registers got everything from the weekend in it  only one guy working the counter  big chuck over here throws a few rocks at the place  gets the guy to come out  oh you mean like uh like a distraction  exactly right  then the little lady runs over  spraypaints the security camera by the door  aww red is my favorite color tommy  good thats good  then me and milo run in grab the cash  and run out the back like clockwork  wait just so i can be sure about this  she kills the camera with the spray paint  or did you want her to cut the cable on the roof  you see  hes learning  she should cut the cable on the roof  youre the boss tommy  thats right i am the boss  whoa whoa is  is that  w you gonna shoot somebody  no no its not loaded  its just to scare the guy in case you know  you just point it at him like that  thats how they do it now  no not that way more like that  there you go thats good  you ready yeah  show me what you got  hey hey whos there  come on hey  im calling the cops  ah its stuck  im calling the cops  get out of there  the lock on a cashregister drawer  is designed to keep it from pulling open  whack it hard enough the other way and it breaks  hey    tommy yeah  arent we supposed to go out the back  yeah right  oh christ theres a padlock on the back door for   were gonna get pinched over here  were gonna get pinched were   youre saying unless we break the lock right  yeah  we got to break the lock  when a padlocks held onto a door frame  by threeinch wood screws  its no match for a drycleaning rack  that can move  not bad kid    i boosted a new ride you get the cash  clockwork like tommy said  you did good    detective paxson  mr westen  hows the investigation going  pretty well actually  its amazing what a crime lab can do these days  they can trace wire solder duct tape  and link it to various devices found at crime scenes  oh so this is an im onto you visit great  theres more  there was an incident last night at 17th avenue  a dry cleaner was robbed an impala was stolen  and the lead thief  managed to keep his face hidden the entire time  i thought of you  well i am so glad that i am on your mind  but can we cut to the chase are you arresting me  not yet  im just giving you a chance to explain yourself  before the lab work gets done  pass but thanks  well if you change your mind  youll always have a couple officers in the car behind you  see you soon mr westen  shes shotgunning it  trying to tie me to anything on her database  yeah and ill bet shes asking  for an electronicsurveillance warrant for this place asap  shes good you got to give her that  fi did you ditch the impala from last night  yeah its in a boathouse on the river  the cops wont find it for months  so after giving the dry cleaner back all his money  last nights heist cost us a grand  hey thats the least of our worries  mike once that stuff comes back from the crime lab  you are on the run  we need to wrap this up  we need to get to matheson  its time for tommys crew  to run into some cashflow problems  looking good  the sight of a fresh injury has a primal effect on people  if you really need to make a point  sometimes theres no substitute for a good shiner  its never fun  but if thats what sells your story  its worth a little pain  all right good luck buddy  hey milo what happened  yeah im all right im all right  sorry but uh i got to leave town  what are you talking about  theres these guys up north  uh i owe them some money and they uh they found me  and uh anyway the point is i got to earn  and listen youve been great  but uh ripping off dry cleaners is just not gonna do it for us  listen to me ii know were just getting started  and you were a little nervous last night  but you did real good man  hey coming from you that means so much to me  but uh   i need a real score and i need it real soon so  milo milo milo listen to me  you know the worst odds i ever saw on a dog   he was so excited raring to go  i put a cnote down  he win  busted his leg out of the shoot  they were gonna put him down  so i took him a perfectly good dog  got gimpy leg  hes not a new car but the point is  you got to wait for the door to open before you can run  working with you has been like a dream come true  but unless i make some real money  theyre gonna break my leg like that dog in your story  im sorry  hey wait milo i might got something for you  meet me over at jimmys with the guys later  i want to introduce you to an associate of mine   rick matheson  what  he work for you or something  no no wwe work together  uh on the big jobs of course  so you dress nice  yeah ill be there  care to explain why you deducted  a 452 hisandhers spa weekend  i was conducting business  business as defined by tax law  does not involve the application of cucumber lotion  disallowed    your tax deficiency is nearing 25 mr axe  now one more suspect deduction  and were gonna  were gonna have to uh  wait a minute i know you  your moms josie conolly  i dated her back in the day  we used to play catch  you were the little boy with the girl name  okay look there are a lot of men named stacey through history  stacey andrews   male offensive tackle for the philadelphia eagles  stacey roest   male hockey player for the detroit red wings  tvs stacy keach was a wonderful male actor  i think hes best known for  you know what  lets just focus on business now  do you remember  the one time i bought you a pack of baseball cards  i have no idea what youre referring to mr axe  you have to remember you had a bike  it was a schwinn i got some tape  okay you must be recalling some other child acquaintance  no we took the cards put them in the spokes of your wheel  and when you rode around in it   it sounded like a motorcycle youd call me evel knievel  you acted like you liked me  and then one day  you disappeared and you never came back  oh no no it wasnt like that  i thought you were a good kid  when your ma broke things off i called a couple times  tried to take you to a game or something  but she uh she didnt want to have anything to do with me  you know how it goes    i think i have everything i need for my audit  stacey wait a second  lllets grab a beer and catch up  or  or no beer well  well just   you dated staceys mother  just for a bit  looks like it was long enough to make an impression  yeah  i guess so  its a challenge to place a bug on someones body  without them noticing  it helps if they always carry something you can reproduce   a phone a watch or a pack of cigarettes  then its just a matter of planting it on them  and hoping they keep ignoring the surgeon general  until you get what you need  mike this is a dicey time to be doing this  youre only wanted for questioning now  but this is gonna be a fullfledged hunt   dont have a choice sam  got to hope that paxsons  still keeping her distance from matheson  hey nice jacket  very sharp real professional  how good does he look huh chuck  yeah not bad yeah  yeah so listen this uh this guy

 and we meet later to split the score  yeah  all right there he is  lets do it  look sharp tommy  anything goes wrong  the dealers will be coming from there and there  these guys gonna be armed or what  eh nothing you cant handle killer    superglues cheap quiet and powerful  lay it on thick and forcedry it with canned air  and you can cut bonding time to less than a minute  mike i am not in love with this tactical position  not even with fis prep work  my prep work as you call it could hold off an army  hey im just saying  i love explosives as much as the next guy   we just need to keep the bad guys from killing each other  until the cops get here  by standing in between them    why cook at home when theres takeout    oops    yes hello police  im at 17th and palm in uh little dominica  i just saw some guys with automatic weapons    okay tommy lets go    the box  go come on    tommy dude move the van come on  move the  tommy tommy  the front  come on  come on    yeah  uh boss im not sure about the plan  its almost like you were trying to get us killed out here  all right look open the door  tommy screwed up something isnt right  actually i think its you that screwed up  you screwed up bad    oh here are the cops got to run  youre setting me up  not used to being the guy in the trap are you  what made you think you could piss off  every drug dealer and cop in town  and not get any payback  oh wait thats your problem   you dont think  son of a bitch  lets go  its your lucky day bitch  i should get myself a lottery ticket  and you should get yourself a lawyer  detective found the other getaway car on the street   its a silver 09 impala lt  a silver impala are you sure  yeah  youll never believe what we found in the trunk  remember my 200to1 shot  its just him and me now  time to go straight tommy  if i ever see you in a police computer again  you dont have to worry about that  my moms back in saint louis  i was thinking uh i might move there  start a kennel or something  sounds good  hey thanks  the way you and your friends had my back  i think you guys are gonna be okay without me    i closed my biggest case today  congratulations thanks  the thing is he was a master criminal  who managed to get stuck in a locked meth lab  with c4 in a getaway car parked outside  wow tough break  hmm the funny thing is  is hes never been tied to any cases with c4  and that c4 that was found in his trunk  its the same used in seven explosions in the miami area  any thoughts  well it seems like you can close the books on those cases  or you can keep coming after me  and have the case against matheson unravel  so i get matheson and you get a free pass  if i got a pass which im not saying that i did  it was anything but free  its like i told you detective were on the same side    just remember where the line is mr westen  i will be watching you  id expect nothing less  conolly thanks for your call sam  man  i was so mad at you  when your name came across my desk  i thought this is it  this is my chance to get you back  well im glad you found me  yeah  i am too  so how about another drink sam  coming right up  there you go  okay  is there alcohol in this  cause its masked by sort of a uh peachy citrus flavor  its called a fuzzy navel  its not really my kind of thing  but we got to start you off easy  work your way up to the good stuff  i got to tell you sam youre like a   youre like a drinking genius here    ive forgotten more about the subject  than you will ever know      if im in a bar  and i cant get the bartenders attention  cause i need some information about a drink  would it be okay if i uh  would it be okay if i call you  absolutely stacey  anytime  is this not the best audit ever    i got rid of the rest of the c4  such a waste  small price to pay for getting the cops off our back  mm i guess  now that were in the clear  theres a few gigs ive lined up for us  fi this isnt a good time  paxsons backing off  but we still have no idea whos coming after me next  i still need back in  michael priorities change  people change  tommy always thought hed be a criminal  maybe youll find  you sure  im sure  im free of the people who burned me  im clear of the cops  this is the moment ive been waiting for  this is moment ive been waiting for too    fi  lets just enjoy dinner
