this much money things get complicated  change a light bulb in a place like this  and a week later youre on a speedboat  in the cayman islands with someone shooting at you  mr westen  i spoke to lucy  she told me you do investigations  i do a lot of things  last month there was a robbery  22 million in odd jewelry and antiques  it was very bad  looks like the police are into it  says here theyre talking to persons of interest  youre a person of interest  the police asked me questions  when this happened i was at home watching tv with my kid  the security code they used for the alarm is the master code  my code  besides supervise the staff i set the shifts   it looks bad  yeah that looks pretty bad  i told the police i worked there 15 years  i would never do this  mr pyne talked to them said it wasnt me  they took my passport told me not to travel  if they arrest me my son hes 8 years old  im all he has  im desperate please dont make my son an orphan  just so were clear  you want me to figure out who ran off  with 22 million in stuff catch the bad guys  clear your name all for what is it  4500  4600  oh well thats much better  im sorry  i have nowhere else to turn  please  all right im gonna see what i can do  i need to talk to your boss can i do that  yeah come on  what are you exactly mr westen  a private detective  oh no i wish  nothing that official  no im just a friend of a friend in town for a while  i thought id see if i can help  oh thank you  javiers been with me for a number of years  it kills me to see what hes going through  what was stolen  some jewelry some artwork  insured but the artwork was irreplaceable  impressionists mostly  i had a sisley a clausen and some other works  houses landscapes  im in real estate so ive got this thing for houses  and youre confident javier had nothing to do with it  oh this is miami  any incident and the police blame the nearest cuban  or haitian  you should have seen the way they were all over my gardeners  what about the security codes  oh lord knows  the police are looking into it  you know to be honest im just glad nobody was hurt  was there anyone unknown to you around guests  any new business associates that came to the house  not that i can think of i went over all this with the police  you can talk to vince if you want to  he takes care of my security  i just have a few questions  see if anyone missed anything  i talked to the police  i dont mean to bother you  it would be a big help  does mr pyne have any enemies  anybody worth 100 mil has enemies  which is why he hired a bodyguard  i mean a head of security  im specifically talking about enemies  that might rob his home though  we know who did this  mr pyne has a soft spot for javier  i dont  as far as im concerned the sooner hes arrested  the better  well youve been a big help  place is upstairs in the back  rent is 200 a month and  if anyone finds out im there i say i broke in sam told me  its not so easy to live in this place you know  all night club is boomboom  fine its fine  but i think guy next door sells drugs to my customers  make fight with people  try to talk he puts a gun in my face  now at home i can deal  but here with immigration liquor license  its a big risk for me yeah  i can handle that good  the real michael westen yes  yeah  back home your story russian intelligence tells to scare  they say you are one name for many people  special operations team  they think one person cannot make so much problems  nope  just me  nice to meet you michael  new world yes  yes  mom  my mom would have been a great nsa communications operative  how did you get this number  thats how you greet your mother  i got it from your girlfriend  fiona  mom what do you want  were you gonna come and see me  im not gonna be in town that long so i cant  come now then you can drive me to the doctor  i dont even have a car so i  yeah well youll figure something out  drop me in the middle of the gobi desert  bury me in a goddamn cave on the moon  and somehow shed find a way to call me  and ask me for a favor  i dont like stealing cars but sometimes its necessary  i have rules though  ill keep it clean  if i take your car on a work day ill have it back by 500  things have gone to hell since you left thank god youre back  im not back  youre here for the holidays though youre staying for christmas  mom dont smoke in the car please its not mine  please  figuring out if a car is tailing you  is mostly about driving like youre an idiot  you speed up slow down signal one way turn the other  of course ideally youre doing this without your mother in the car  michael where are you going  the hospital is on 20th  this is a shortcut mom please do not smoke in the car  donotsmoke in the car  you know you missed your fathers funeral  by eight years  well last time i talked to him he said ill see you in hell boy  so i figured we had something on the books  michael  the two of you were so much alike  i dont know why you had to antagonize him  mom we werenothingalike  everything i did antagonized him  being alive antagonized him  everything i did was a reason for him to slap me around  michael what are you doing  whos driving you or me  actually losing a tail isnt about driving fast  a highspeed pursuit is just gonna land you on the 600 news  so you just keep driving like an idiot  until the other guy makes a mistake  again all of this is easier without a passenger  yelling at you for missing a decades worth  of thanksgivings  you were the one that kept the family going  after you left everything just fell apart  ive been sending money  what about nate  dont get me started  your brother is a mess  you really should go see him michael  i dont think its a good idea for us to see each other  i cant take care of him all by myself i am sick  you know that im sick  well what i know is that youve been treated  for every disease known to man  i know this because im paying all the bills  just because they cant find out whats wrong with me  does not mean im not sick  please  you dont know michael  i dont tell you everything that goes on  i dont need to know everything  what stop  mike  just  look were here  are you coming in  no i have to make a phone call mom  im right behind you  fine michael  okay mom  michael westen for dan siebels  im sorry  yeah i know i know he doesnt exist  you tell him from me if he doesnt call me back i  will be in touch with him soon  sorry im uh  i just im not  yeah hes with her  sleep through an aerial bombing or two  and noise isnt an issue  you just need some privacy and a bed  in a pinch you can lose the bed  but the privacy is important for projects like this one  with everyone xraying and chemicaltesting their mail  these days a box of wire and pipe  and batteries sprinkled with chemical fertilizer  is a great attentiongetter  hey thanks for coming  come on in  you want some coffee  no no  its not a problem  i made some just fresh  i just wanted to talk about  this is my son david  david say hi  hi  are you a soldier  uh no  sort of  my dad says youre here to help us  i might be i just need to talk to your dad about some money first  then are you gonna shoot the people that robbed mr pyne  no no  that shouldnt be necessary  what if they shoot at you  well in that case it would be necessary so yeah  okay  david go play  i can play here  in your room  want to see my room  david go  im sorry  its fine  so will you help  ill need half the money up front  i dont know 2300  okay wait wait  i need you to know something  ill follow this wherever it leads  i finish what i start  we do it my way no questions  got it  thank you  working hard  tanning is an art and a science mike  you want something to drink  they can bring you whatever you want  no im fine  so what have you found out about pynes hired gun  well he washed out of the rangers after a couple years  then he went to work for some private military outfit in iraq  some kind of meathead mercenary sort of thing  any progress with the job  i checked the estates security logs nothing there  so its the hard way then  the best angle is the art  i find the buyer ill work my way back  to who pulled off the job  well how you gonna do that  i need you to set up a meeting with me and barry  can do  whether youre a coke dealer a thief an arms dealer  or a spy you need someone to clean your money  which makes a good money launderer  the closest thing you can get to a yellow pages  for criminals  even better a money launderer will always  take your phone call burn notice or no burn notice  good to see you ive heard about your troubles  yeah well im working on it  thanks for coming barry  im in the service industry  thats what i do i help  so  what you need  an art dealer  no no no no  arts a bad place to park money these days  irs is all over the place  plus some schmuck in new york says the wrong thing  take a bath  how about stamps  nice and portable  coins  got this guy who does coins  all cash  has to be art  i need someone to find me a piece thats not  on the regular market  hot paintings  i might know someone  nobody gets hurt  nobody you care about  just remember who still helped you when you were down  me barry thats who  i gave you love  you remember  ill remember  excuse me  im just  sorry man we were waiting on sugar and got carried away  sugar  yeah i dont know his real name  but he usually hooks us up  we wanted to score some e  are you the new guy leave  now  mom what is it  this isnt your mom  dan hey good to hear from you  i thought you lost my number  just spent three hours with the fbi  discussing your little present  they wondered why someone was sending me a pipe bomb with no explosive in it  thought itd get your attention  so tell me whats going on  i dont know  burn notice is eyesonly  for what its worth i think its bull  but i dont control these things  tell me who to talk to or im coming to dc  and raising some hell  dont do that michael  youre on all the fbi watch lists  you go anywhere theyre all over you  what for  all i know is that whoever did this wants you on ice  you leave miami you heat up fast  were talking manhunt police in every state  things may change but for now be smart  lay low  can i at least see the burn notice  if i could see who issued it then maybe i can do something about this  i risked enough just calling  look some of us are still on your side  you pull another stunt like this though and i wont be one of them  whats up bro  you new around here  well my name is sugar  and i heard you messed with some of my friends last night  i asked a few of your customers to get out of here yeah  whats your problem  my problem right now is a prettyboy drug dealer  with a bad dye job thats standing in my way  ohh whoa did i hurt you bro  doesnt matter how much traing you have  a broken rib is a broken rib  dont start fights you cant finish bro  ill break it  i dont want to but i will if i have to  all right all right  all right let go  let go let go  you come highly recommended mr westen  what are you interested in  specifically  british postimpressionists  sisley steer  thats nice  we dont see much of that  most specialty stock is out of the east these days  iraqi antiquities russian icons  although thats mostly forged garbage  i can get you some french impressionists  my collection is mostly focused on the camden town group  oh very nice  i wish i had something  several pieces were on the market about six months ago  there was a sisley and several clausens  although it didnt sell  really  do you rember who  oh i dont remember the name  one of these condo developers that are everywhere these days  but during the impressionist bubble in the 90s  he went to all the major dealers wanted to dump it  it was all very discreet but  people talk  really  what happened  nobody was interested is what happened not at his price  im sorry i cant help but  no no no you you have been very helpful thank you  i do have some grecoroman nude wrestling statues  you might like to take a look at  i never run around in the bushes in a ski mask  when im breaking in someplace  somebody catches you what are you gonna say  you want to look like a legitimate visitor  until the very last minute  if you cant look legit confused works almost as well  maybe get a soda from the fridge or a yogurt  if youre caught you just act confused  and apologize like crazy for taking the yogurt  nothing could be more innocent  cracking an oldschool safe is pretty tough  but modern hightech security makes it much easier  thing is nobody wipes off a fingerprint scanner  after they use it so whats left on the scanner  is a fingerprint  fighting for the little guy is for suckers  we all do it once in a while but the trick  is to get in and out quickly without getting involved  thats one trick i never really mastered  javier javier  you want some cereal no  all i got is the one with the little marshmallow guys  dont worry about that  i just want to talk to you before you go to work  what is it is it something wrong  basically your boss sold you out  he robbed his own house probably had vince do the job  he collects the insurance and youre the fall guy  mr pyne  no he wouldnt  he talked to the police for me  that just makes it easier for him to collect on the insurance  youre a trusted employee  he had no idea  take a look at this  half his realestate projects are just paper  empty lots he paid a loan officer to sign off on  he borrowed against those to finance other deals  but with the market cooling hes bleeding money  and the art is all he has  without the insurance payout it all comes crashing down  what do i do  well you could go to jail   you could run  statute of limitations is about 20 years  or you could fight back  pyne doesnt want any of this to get out  as long as we have this information we have leverage  ill handle the details  but it could get dangerous  people do bad things when this much money is on the line  money  dont worry about the money  you want to do this or not  youre not going to work today or ever again  im gonna go talk to pyne  but be prepared  this could get sketchy  hey  you really want me to shoot someone dont you  hey  so mr westen what can i do for you  i just wanted to update you  fortunately i think we can be pretty sure  that javier had nothing to do with the robbery  have you spoken to the police  im not sure you want me to do that  take a look at this  i think this points pretty clearly  to um some other suspects  whered you get this  i found it in the course of my investigation  cops might find it too if say javier was arrested  im guessing thats something youd want to avoid  well you two have a lot to talk about  i know my way out  does that shirt come in mens  youre head of my security  well its your job damn it  powerful people dont like being pushed around  you can never quite predict what theyre going to do  or have their washedout specialforces  security guys do  the point is blackmail is a little like owning a pit bull  it might protect you or it might bite your hand off  thats why it pays to make sure you know what theyre thinking  and that means eavesdropping  hi can i help you  yeah i need two of these  and your cheapest phone  that one  oh the hello sweetheart is it for your little girl  no  oh the hello sweetheart yeah thats fine  to build a listening device you need a crappy phone with a  mike that picks up everything  but you want the battery power and circuits of a better phone  its a trick you learn when the purchasing office  wont spring for a bug  hello sweetheart  so sam and i are gonna plant the bug tomorrow  so we can listen in on pyne  fi i want to ask you um  yeah  i need someone to track him provide a little  tactical support  sure  itll be just like the old days  that sounds like fun  im glad you think so  i havent worked so hard for so little money since afghanistan  afghanistan  but at least there my mother wasnt calling me   thank you for giving her my number  youre welcome  any thoughts as to why youre so unpopular  why didnt they just kill you  it might be a lesson a warning  maybe somebody wants to offer me a job  but they want me desperate before they make the offer  it could be a lot of things i dont know  itll be good for you to stay in one place resolve some issues  well i travel halfway across the world  to get away from those  my point exactly  maybe if you stop running you can maintain  a normal relationship  listen fi theres a few things im good at  tactical analysis handtohand combat and im a decent cook  but relationships  theyre just not my thing  they never were  well now youre in miami  get yourself a 24yearold with big fake tits  they bore me  if it makes you feel any better  you were the closest  i ever got  it it just wasnt close enough i guess  things could have worked out with us michael  you were robbing banks for the ira  a spy is just a criminal with a government paycheck  youre the one with two fbi agents watching him eat  three  one  two  behind me at the bar  bravo  shall we shoot them  ive got enough problems  well more sake then  when  when fi when  what what  i cant shag a man who works in a bank  the end  he was rich hes handsome and you broke up with him  he had no tactical awareness  he didnt know how to shoot  he didnt know how many exits were in a building  oh god  you spoil me michael  i thought it was my winning smile  dont move  sugar wants you out  she has nothing to do with this  shut up  hes right  michael shut up  i can handle myself  you really ought to do something about your neighbors  i know i know  fun yeah  shall we  yeah well fi fi  violence is foreplay for you  its not for me  i got to take care of this and then i got to go to bed  night  ill see you tomorrow  fi you know i could  that went well  youll like this  i found out vince is calling all his army buddies  trying to figure out who you are  yeah good luck with that  i dont even know  ill have them feed him something hold him off  well stay on it  i have a little homeimprovement project i have to do  once somebody sends a guy with a gun after you  things are only going to get worse  but like it or not youve got work to do  for a job like getting rid of the drug dealer next door  ill take a hardware store over a gun any day  guns make you stupid  better to fight your wars with duct tape  duct tape makes you smart  every decent punk has a bulletproof door  whos there  hi its your neighbor  but people forget walls are just plaster  hopefully you get him with the first shot  or the second  my knee  come on inside  now hes down and waiting for you  to come through the front door  so you dont come through the front door  dont move  easy vanilla ice  now you got 20 minutes to clear out  do you understand  yes yes  the wound is not that bad  disinfect it wrap it in this and you get to a hospital  you wont walk with a limp  youre still here in 20 minutes a limp will be  the least of your problems   do you understand me  yes  look point is you getting burned  wouldnt have happened back then  i mean in the 80s the rules were the rules  they had their guys we had our guys  wasnt so goddamn complicated  you could get your head around it  now today its all about religion and oil  its no fun anymore  i tell you im glad i got out when i did  good morning bloody mary  hey you want some  no im fine  hey is that your mom again  yep  all right

call me if he makes any moves  well get about 24 hours out of that battery  its voiceactivated so youll hear a beep  yeah i know the drill mike you do your thing  people with happy families dont become spies  a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops  you dont trust anyone youre used  to getting smacked around and you never get homesick  i think ive got a parasite  you dont have a parasite  pills dont work as soon as it reaches your liver  the pills are for you not to think youre sick all the time  you and the doctor you think im crazy  i think hes letting me die of a parasite  cause i cant pay his bill  oh for now can we just try these pills  i put up the tree  i can see that  did you go see your brother yet  cause um  i thought we could all be you know together
