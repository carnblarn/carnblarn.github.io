                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn noticeon you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you   a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your helpmichael  bottom line  until you figure out who burned you youre not going anywhere    briberys a lot more difficult than it sounds  theres no way to shop around so you usually overpay for whatever information youre after  theres no moneyback guarantee if the informations bad  and of course the only thing that you know for sure  is that youre handing your money to a thief and a liar  i still cant believeyoure giving all this money to some sleazy bank manager  i went to a lot of troubleto find this guy  i dont havea lot of options here  michael he hid money for a manwho tried to assassinate you  which makes hima good person to know if im trying to findthat assassin  youre going to this meetingunarmed you have no information  its a tactical risk  fi i was warned not to meet you the first time  yeah i almost blew off your handwith a block of c4  and i made a friend  maybe ill make another one watch my back  gustavo    do you have the money  no small talk how was the flight  bad all the way herei wonder why i

regulationsin the cayman islands are not easy to penetrate  i have friends  what friends  i dont even know who you are orwhy you want this information  when someones asking for sensitive information  its basic security to make sure that the person youre dealing with is who he says he is  an easy way is to change details that the other person would know  gustavo we talked about thison the phone im giving you 8000for a file  part of what that money buysis privacy  ii dont carewhat i said on the phone  you dont tell mewhat i want to know you dont get this file 8000 no 8000  the deal i made with

mine did but i figured you could use the protein  thanks  so there was nothing on my friend with the knives  no except that hes as dead as that fish  probably got smuggled in  fi knows some people who

of the worst monsters on earth are just spoiled rich kids  mass murderers come in many shapes and sizes  but they tend to drink the same brands of champagne  thats the guy  jeanpierre duman  his dadwas a regional governor   damn near turned corruptioninto an art form died a few years back  jeanpierre went intothe family business  yeah party boy thereran the local prison  anybody

just got toget into his place  into his highsecurity placeon star island  mike nothing worth doingis easy and nobody loves easymore than me but its true  fiona feel likecoming to a party  people love the sound of their native tongue  even the most securityconscious person often lets his guard down  when he hears somebody who speaks his language  if that somebody happens to be in a designerssre  what i cant go in  so much the better            i will see you both later  no no you wont  and what do you supposei will be doing later  ill think of something  i dont even know your name  luc renard

youre driving my car back  no problem mike  come out duman he murdered my daughter  staying hidden isnt always about sticking to the shadows  get in the car now  in fact if youre enemys eyes are adjusted to the dark  theres no better place to be than behind the brightest light you can find  why did you come  why did you change your mind  because thatsthe kind of guy he is  hes an honorable manjust like they told you  hes just a little slowsometimes  so where do we gofrom here  you go back to haiti  i am not leaving i am stayinguntil it is done  we have more experiencewith this kind of thing  i can help  i found duman when no one elsecould find him  ah listen claude youve done your part now let us do ours well get the guy  how how will you do that  by getting him to give usevidence proving who he is  now mikeis a very convincing guy  trust me you can count on him  but you need to go home  its better for everyone you understand  yes i understand  so i asked around aboutwho might have brought your knifewielding fake bankerinto the country  it was rough i mean the miami gun smugglersand the miami people smugglers they dont get along  and ive always beenmore of a gun person  youre sure as hellnot a people person  you want to take over sam  oh wait thats right i forgot  all your friends wear uniformswhich makes you useless  hey who found out about thisguy in the first place huh  sam fijust keep looking  i intend to  good newson the haitian front  i got an angle on duman  his family used to do businesswith flintridge industries  its a big multinationalthat built all the prisons  fbis been nosing around themfor years  you still in touchwith those fbi agents that were on the follow michaelwesten around miami beat  well i could make a call but we didnt parton the best of terms  well i think its timeto mend some fences sam  if youve spent time working for the government you understand that its a game with its own rules  if you want to make the government work for you you have to know how the game is played  an fbi agent might hate you but if working with you gets him out of an assignment he hates even more  youve got yourself a partner  hey guys whats going on huh  she looks dangerous  cute sam  you know youre interferingwith a federal investigation  what is she like 80 did shesteal somebodys dentures  its a racketeering case  biggest drugsmuggling familyin south florida  is she the boss  bosss grandmother  oh man  you should check the film speedin that camera  at the rate shes movingyou dont want to miss anything  what do you want axe  i come bearing gifts  i have a peace offeringa case that you guys can take back to your officeand be proud of  you might even get a commendation fromthe higherups  this more crap like the stuffyou gave us on westen  hey i never liedto you guys about him  well surei forgot some stuff  what is it sam weve got work to do here  hes an international fugitive hiding in miamiunder a new identity  related to an investigationyou guys are already doing  hmm thats a wholedifferent department sam   years in court  listen guysjust check it out all right  weve had our differences but i know you fbi guysbust your ass every day to do the right thing  ill give you a timeand a place  just check it out  watch out for granny  you know if you guys want meto take her out let me know all right good luck  being a fugitive takes work  when youre being hunted hiding isnt something you can do effectively without help  so the best way to catch a fugitive isnt to approach him as one of the people hunting him down  its to approach him as one of the people who can help him stay on the run  ladies im terribly sorry but i have a very importantmeeting with mr duman now   could you excuse us  who are you  me my name is owen matthews  but the more importantquestion is who are you  if you dont want to havea very public very uncomfortable conversationon that topic right now  id ask these ladiesto leave  what do you

uh sure yeahi can get you over there  great cause i need a partner tooall right  so you can hang outfor the class and then give mea ride back  partner stretching that sounds painful  ugh boy  geez

fbi they know my real name   is that the bug in dumans office  yeah  what do i pay you for  to protect meto keep your eyes on things  we found the license plateof the car that was here at the gates

evenheard of the duman family  get out of my way  you think this is gonnasolve anything  no this is gonna solve nothing  it is gonna cause us problems  its gonna make it worse  worse for meworse for my clients worse for you  move  aw mike  you kill that manyou validate everything he says  that means news attentionattention from the fbi  i cannot let that happen  you say you can change the past how  yes i can change that  i can take everything thatconnects you back to haiti  every documentevery bank statement all of it  i can clean it and hand you backa whole new you  a jeanpierre dumanwho never has to hide again  now choose  i can change your story or end it  come to my house tomorrow  your house  is that jeanpierre dumanshouse or luc renards  we will see  no wait wait wait wait  you said you were goingto leave town  no you said it wouldbe safer for me to go  i said i understood  and i do  you put yourself in danger  i do not want safetymr westen  i want justice  claude we saidwe would handle this  you think your daughter wantsyou to get yourself killed  that is what they said when i wanted to goto the prisons to find her  that is what they said when iwanted to go to the newspapers  i failed her before  i will not fail her again  you were not responsible  i was a coward  but never again  i will not leave until jeanpierre duman  is returned to haiti to face what he has done  working covert ops you learn to exploit weakness  you manipulate greed fear pride to make people do what you want  but when youre dealing with true believers those weaknesses arent there  all you can do is help or get out of the way  wait  you wont be safeat your motel  i would like youto stay here  it seems my people skillsare improving michael  you found the guywho smuggled in our fake banker from the cayman islands  i found where he keeps his boatand he just arrived     go easy on him fi  youre breaking up  as a spy its usually best to be unknown  it allows you to adjust to any situation and be whoever you need to be  there are certain advantages to being known however  a reputation can be a powerful tool  wait you leaving   i was just uh   you just got here  i forgot something  i have to go get the thingthat i forgot  look i dont wantany trouble  but we havent hada chance to meet fiona  yeah i know who you are  you shot up pacos boat and you set fireto that guys place up in boca  well they interfered withone of my gun shipments  but you wouldnt do thatwould you gary   were friends  what do you want  well i need to know about a guywho came in a few days ago called himself gustavo  he liked to play with knives  hes dead gary  he fell off a parking garage  i brought him in on a runupfrom the caymans  he paid cash thats it  you know i got to tell youim a little disappointed gary  i expect so much morefrom my friends  i brought him in  i dropped him offat a storage unit  i never saw him again  a storage unit thats good  you wouldnt happen to have theaddress of that storage unit would you gary  ma  what honey  have you seendads power sander  what  ive been to your placemichael your sanders betterthan your fathers  what are you checkingon my progress  ive seen guided missileswith simpler circuitry   why dont you just let me   i can do this  hows sam  recovering  your stretching classnearly killed him  well what doesnt kill himwill make him stronger believe me  i know  i dont think that appliesto cigarettes ma  you want to go downto the police station with me  theyre gonna show me photosof every burglar in the area  no i got to  michaelwhat is so important that you couldntdo that with me  im helping a man get justicefor his murdered daughter  well if you need any help withthat honey you let me know  i think i foundthe storage facility where gustavokept his stuff  not too much damage donei hope  oh no i didnt have to lift a finger  my reputation precedes meapparently  you should think about movinginto one of these storage units  some of themhave airconditioning it would be a step up  ill keep it in mind  call the storage unitand make some inquiries  let them knowgustavo passed away and that youre coming byafterhours to check on the unit  i think i can handle that  and you  can say helloto monsieur duman for me  most people have a hard time letting go of their past  the same guy who will burn a village to the ground without a thought  often wont throw away an old necktie because it reminds him of his highschool graduation  if you know what youre doing you can hang him with that necktie  come in  how does this workwhat you do  you give meeverything you have  your passport your medicalrecords  your financial records everythingfrom the old days  everything that ties youto the name jeanpierre duman  and then  we give youa new set of records  the money siphonedfrom the government turns into incomefrom overseas investments  you get a new travel record proving you werenteven in the country  when your enemies diedin prison  i handle it all  my family left the islandof haiti in a hurry  these are some of the thingswe thought we might need  my fatherwanted to burn them but i thoughtperhaps someday   you made the right choice no man should everhave to hide forever  ill take theseand ill start cleaning them  wait first my father wouldlike to speak to you  your father   ive readthat your father was   was dead yes  back in haiti we buriedanother man in his place  oh no daddys still alive  hes oldfashionedmy father  he wants me to sit in the houseand hide from the cameras but i told him about you  he did not believe but i saidthat you would explain  so  this is the manwho can change the past  i called some peoplei know long ago at flintridge industries  they do not know you  tell me  why is this  some big misunderstanding  lets clear it up though who did you talk to sam  because sam is who i talk to  let me get him on the phone  uh you know sam  hes got the big officewith the big windows south side of the buildingthe glass doors  you know where you can walkright out onto the balcony  there is no such man  who are you  papa waithe said he knewabout the prisons  about flintridgeabout the money he   how many times  i tell you to be careful  but he warned me thatthe fbi was investigating us  tell him  it takes a lot longer to pull a gun than most people think it does   almost five seconds on average to draw and line up a shot  whether this is good news or bad news depends on what side of the gun youre on  get him get him  the papers are gone  they know were looking  theyll have burned themby now  so thats it  now we can do nothing  i didnt say that the papers were just a wayto get him to haiti  i assume there are people who can identify him therewithout papers  yes many people  its time for duman to takea trip back home i like it  fi can you get dumanaway from his bodyguards  oui  sam can you get usa truck  for the chance to take theseguys down ill get us a convoy  when youre abducting someone transportation usually isnt the issue  there is no trick to driving a truck with someone hidden in the back  the challenge is getting them into the truck  you can walk them in drag them in or let gravity do the work and drop them in  well that should do it  i just hopeits not too comfortable  im sure itll be fine  my guys in ties  we checked out duman  looks like the information yougave us is good for once axe  hes a realson of a bitch  thing is theres nota whole lot we can do not without proofof who he is  damn shame really  right but the thing isif you still want to help  come on axeyou know as well as i do we cant do anything officialunless we got warrants  the whole thingsgot to go up the chain  yeah i figured  but unofficiallywhat did you have in mind  luc            spend time with corrupt homicidal thirdworld political figures  and you hear a lot of selfpity        what kind of man throws his political enemies in prison and tortures them to death  usually its a guy who feels so sorry for himself he feels justified doing anything  killers by and large are whiny losers  but that doesnt make them any less dangerous  i do notwant to be disturbed  understand  lie downon your stomach  close your eyes  most overthecounter allergy medicines contain mild sedatives  in the right dosage they cause a pleasant drowsiness  in the wrong dosage they cause dizziness hallucinations and unconsciousness  what was that  my secret  mr duman    mr duman    mr duman open the door    open the door  calm down  keep screamingall the way back to haiti youre gonna be hoarsefor your trial  i guess he cant changethe past after all  you need to get going  sam has a friend with a boat  hell get you bothback to haiti  youll go now  yes  my daughtershe would have liked you  she was very brave  like her father  michael  what are those for  well i thought id uh help you with the rewiringof the car if you needed it  i did it  really  you rewired the carby yourself  i did it  i went through someof your fathers old papers  i found this diagramand i just put the wires back where they weresupposed to be  it wasnt that hardmichael  i dont know what to say  they caught them  teenagersbreaking into garages i watched them come outof mrs hales house  i recognized the photographsand i called the cops  you know why i think your fatherwired the car the way he did  cause i think he thoughtif he was the only one who could fix itthat wed always need him  hed be more useful you knowpart of the family  so did you catch yours  the guy who killed the girl  yeah yeah i did  good for you sweetheart  hey sam your buddys boatmake it back to haiti okay  uh yeahthe coast guard kept clear thanks to you guys  we have no idea what youre talking about axe  yeah right  well i got a list of officialswho took kickbacks from flintridge industriesback in the day  its probably enough for you guys to goafter papa duman too  a little bird told me  little bird huh  he thought it would keep himfrom being returned to the nest  and i figured this could buy youguys some time away from granny  not exactlyby the book axe  or i could send you a bouquetwith a nice card  well find a wayto use this  man all this talkingmakes me hungry but mostly thirsty  drinks on uncle sam yeah come on guys cough it up  mojito  you call the storage place  the managerknows were coming  for the record michaeli dont like this plan  what plan  you using yourself as bait  to see if whoever sent gustavoafter you takes another crack  thats what i would do  youre gonna let me back you upfor real this time  fi  if youre right theres a goodchance hes waiting on a roof with a rifleto take a shot at you  thats what i would do  i need him alive  i need you alive  you see anything fi  not yet  maybe its timewe announced our arrival  if you suspect youre walking into an ambush  searching for where the bad guys are hidden is probably going to get you killed  unless you get lucky and find them in the first place you look youre dead  if you can manage it the best move is to make it impossible to hide  hes right above you  hes on the move michael  when youre in a foot chase the trick is to stay visual contact with  whoever youre pursuing until they run out of gas  of course visual contact doesnt do you much good if youre separated  by a 12foothigh razorwiretopped fence    you should changeyour workout michael  youre not doingenough cardio  wait  michael did you see him  yeah turns out weve met before
