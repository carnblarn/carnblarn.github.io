                i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  spies come from all walks of life  and no two are exactly alike  but whether theyre a burned former operative  a beautiful bomber with a temper  or a harddrinking exseal  they all share one trait  punctuality  hey showing up on time means youre 15 minutes late  its noon michael  where the hell is this guy  you think hes still coming  look i wouldnt mind honestly  if jesse just faded into the mist  i really dont think we need a counterintelligence agent  joining our merry band  jesses investigating the same people we are sam  they nearly killed everyone at this table  i say we hear him out  sure get a guy fired ruin his life  id say you owe him a mojito  and a friendly shoulder to cry on at the very least  i didnt burn him on purpose fi  well he may not see it that way  lets try not to mention it  ah here we are  looks like jesse got here on time after all  peopleon the house  with carlitos compliments  nice guy i see why you guys like coming here  i told you this place is secure  hey no offense man cant be too careful  what im about to hit you guys with is pretty heavy  so uh if anybody feels uncomfortable  discussing code matters of national security  you might just want to you know leave  all right fair enough dont say i didnt warn you  about a year ago im working for the defense department  get wind of some nasty business   bombings assassinations kidnappings you name it  it was global but it looked like there was a pattern to me  is that what brought you down to miami  yeah yeah i was looking at weapons supply lines into the hottest spots  found a connection right here at the port  a lot of guns coming off of ships that passed through algeria  you got a source  i made contact with a guy  shipping artillery for one of the operations  told him i wanted to move some guns of my own  did you get a name or a face  only spoke on the phone  he had this uh this trippy voice  it was like sort of like a low hiss  it was weird so i called him cobra  cobra  im sorry thats just a  a crappy code name  oh well maybe you can make up the code names  when its your investigation  how about that  so i was supposed to meet up with him a couple weeks ago  he didnt show up  now i dont know if he got cold feet or what  but if we can find him we can crack this thing wide open  looks like were gonna spend some time down on the docks  now hold on mike this sounds dangerous  before you sign us up for this mission  i want to ask our friend here a very important question  what kind of snacks do you like  identifying an illicit weapons shipment  from a specific country  isnt as simple as checking manifests  or spotting a flag on a ship  its too easy for arms dealers to fake both  but phony paperwork and false flags  wont stop crew members from telling you the straight story  chat up the right deckhand and you can learn  where every shady piece of cargo came on board  theres no substitute for human intelligence  okay nice talking to you  go ahead jesse  no luck  crew caught diseases in half the ports in the middle east  but they didnt dock in algeria  well i have more bad news for you jesse  you are never packing the cooler again  spray cheese and bologna ew  youre welcome  oh look at this  look at this  looks like the same two scumbags that were here on tuesday  swiping flatscreens  hey open those cans  come on little fella at least take a swing  just do it probably afraid to  this ports got some gang trouble you know what  im getting a little tired of watching these poor bastards  getting shaken down every other day  got nothing to do with cobra jesse  scumbags get a pass today  i dont think they do  we cant blow our surveillance  aah  we wont hurt ya hey  white 97 corolla hi  you dinged my car in the parking lot buddy what  i drive a cadillac and i parked in the street  do you drive a cadillac or did you park on the street  which is it you lying son of a bitch  make up your mind what are you looking at little man  got nothing to do with you get out of here  hey hey hes not going anywhere  no no no this is between me and you  are you deaf dude what did i say  what did i say get out of here hes not going   ugh  i like this guy   are we good here cause we should really get back to   no no its okay  i was just telling hank here  how we work undercover for one of the shipping companies  oh thats us  undercover shipping people  yeah what  what  what company is that again  oh we cant really talk about it  you know how big corporations like to keep everything quiet  hank was just saying the docks been having some trouble  i told him we could help  yeah i doubt it the guys who busted up my arm  theyre mobbed up  theyve been pressuring me and some of the other security staff  to help them steal stuff out of the containers  have you tried going to the police  yeah a buddy of mine richie he went to the police  they found him facedown in his pool  you think i want to end up like that  probably not  cant go against these guys  i keep hearing about the boss tony caro  hes ruthless  and the day of the funeral  he shot up richards house   richies wife and kids still inside  charming  well it sounds like straightup racketeering  theres got to be something we can do right  set some cameras up get a little eavesdropping equipment in here  hank why dont you call in sick for the next couple days  see if you can let that hand heal  you guys really gonna help me  apparently  jesse we didnt spend all this time on the docks  to help a guy deal with some mobsters  hey im just doing what you did for me  you see someone in trouble you dont stand on the sidelines  isnt that what youre all about  what company do we work for jesse  do we get uniforms  i told hank what he needed to hear to make him comfortable all right  oh is he gonna be comfortable when you wire him up  a few cameras and some eavesdropping   thats your plan  what we get enough tape on these guys  we can wrap it up in a nice little bow for the cops  whats wrong with that hes not trained  do you know what happens  to people who are not trained in the field  they die im not trying to get him killed  im trying to solve his problem and maybe ours  hank could be someone we can work for shipping documents  a paper trail may be our best hope for finding cobra  you know hes actually right michael  how about before we do anything  we find out exactly what were up against  so i checked in with my cop buddy  on the organized crime task force  he gave me this beast  its like the yellow pages for floridas connected  i guess they had a few left over from the rico days  turns out this is their favorite watering hole  this is a mob bar  you were expecting red leather booths and frank sinatra  its miami mike  i assume the g in the suits the boss  yep tony caro  supposedly he runs things in south florida  for a crime family up in new york  what else do we have on him  well just that hes miami born and bred  was a suspect in seven murders  but was never so much as charged  the guys mr clean  maybe its time we threw a little dirt on him  i cant believe im out of lemon juice  will lime juice do  i dont know madeline you know it depends  are you willing to settle for bplus hummus  im not  im kidding  itll be fine all i got to do is add my secret ingredient  cumin  mm  its funny  seems like the only thing i know about you  is you like your food extraspicy  what is it you do again  michael said what government work  i used to yeah mm  does that have anything to do with why you always  leave the house through a different door  or you never park your car in the same spot on the street  superstitious i guess  mmhmm  i think hes here to see me  course he is  your mom is no joke  could give most counterintel agents a run for their money  im surprised she hasnt broken you yet  oh trust me i can handle it  whats the latest on our mob problem  well theyre careful  best bet is to convince them  that the feds are on to their port operation  get them to walk away  okay how do we do that  we arent doing anything  uh yes we are i want in on it  theyve seen your face jesse  i need to get ears on them  okay so youre gonna bug a bunch of wiseguys  good luck with that theyll be looking for it  trust me i can handle it  ideally a bug should never be seen by anyone  but when theres a possibility it may be  its best to make it look like something  people wont want to touch  a wad of gum stuck to a balledup piece of tissue  and a sprinkling of whatevers in your lint trap  will usually do the trick  okay thats disgusting  thanks sam  what do you have  proud of this one mikey  figured we needed a guy  who had to appear willing to sell information to a mobster  right  so went through a few files  and i found a guy whose identity you could borrow  and whose history over the last six months  you could make up and nobody would know the difference  the suspense is killing me sam  ned gordon recently suspended fbi agent  real guy apparently is on a drinking binge  somewhere in the alaskan wilderness  here you go what do you think  not bad sam  not bad short of being in the federal computer system you are all set  now all you need is a cheap sports coat and some ugly shoes  organized crime bosses  like senior administrators in any business  have a lot of people who want to meet with them  hang around long enough asking for some face time  and you can get yourself on the schedule  but dont count on the receptionist  offering you coffee while you wait  listen you son of a bitch  im doing you a favor  letting you sell those tvs in your store  im sorry its my son  i needed to buy some medicine  when am i gonna get my money  today in the afternoon i swear  dont let this happen again  or your kids gonna have other problems  that no amount of medicines gonna fix you understand me  do you understand me get him out of here before i kill him  this the guy  says his names ned  you been standing in front of my place for half a day  you got something you want to talk to me about  yeah if i uh  if i had some uh information  about an ongoing investigation into y  into this place i mean  how much would that be worth to you  investigation i dont know what youre talking about  no im not  im  im just asking if i had information  ballpark approximate  how much would that be worth to you  tell you what  why dont we take it like this  you tell me who you are and what you got  and ill decide what its worth  no i  you know what forget it you know  i should just   ugh  its too late for forget it my friend  who are you  insideleft jacket pocket  whats this  a fed  didnt you frisk this guy before you brought him in  wait wait wait wait wait wait  no i used to be with the bureau  but im on leave  suspension  for what whiskey all right  i  im clean now  so you want to talk about my personal life  or do you want to hear what i have to say  all right  ill hear you out mr former special agent ned gordon  heres what youll do  dean and i are gonna meet you  at this place at 400  all right  oh one other thing  ugh  dont ever come back here again  ever  get him out of here  tony should be here any minute  stay sharp  yeah tell that to michael hopefully he can sell this  here they come  wheres tony  tonys not coming  wwhat do you mean hes not coming  you  he said  see theres just one problem  special agent gordon  youre not special agent gordon  ugh  you want to tell us who you really are  take the shot  wait wait  take the shot what are you doing  giving him a chance to get out of there  we start putting holes in people its gonna get ugly  ah  dont want to talk huh what okay  you got time to change your mind  tony said to kill you real slow  wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait  okay okay ill talk  no im gonna talk  ill talk ill talk ill talk  holding someones arms behind their back  is a good technique for a bully on the playground  but it leaves you very exposed  im gonna talk  a wellplaced kick right beneath the knee  will cripple your opponent  and a crippled opponent  can be a great weapon  the guy can handle himself ill give him that  he has his moments  okay so listen mike  i think i found out how tony knew that you werent fbi  listen to what i got off the bug earlier  i called my guy at the fbi  that son of a bitch was trying to play us  oh hes got a fed in his pocket nice  that would explain how he avoided getting busted all these years  so why are we here sam  so you can tell us tonys untouchable  have a little faith mike i think i found a new angle  now you see that guy in there talking to tony  thats gio russo  hes a lieutenant in the same new york crime family  that tony works for  according to the cops hes down here on vacation  turns out hes down here to squeeze tony  lets have a listen  not another word tony  i didnt come down here to watch the situation get worse  you think its my fault that the economys down  you think that im not riding the docks hard enough  why dont you calm down this is calm  you want to see pissed  come in 15 grand light again next week  youll see pissed  its been like that all afternoon  thats bad news for hank  tonys not gonna stop squeezing him  yeah but it means he might be desperate enough  to make a stupid move  if we can get him to do some dirty work himself  we can get him busted for something  his fed buddies cant get him out of  sounds like he needs a little push  he knows me sam  i think its time for him to meet chuck finley  now thats a code name  hows it going man  i know i know listen were working on your tony problem  its gonna take a little more time okay  i cant stay away from the docks any longer  people are asking questions  i mean i dont even know what security company you guys are with   hank thats not something we can talk about  its for your own safety its national security okay  yeah about that  i got those papers you wanted  got f178s and manifests from every ship from algeria  in the last three months there  this is perfect  oh yeah this will help thank you  how exactly  just go home and get some rest all right  hey  hey what can i do for you  um im sorry to bother you i just uh   i found some of michaels old things in a closet  and i thought maybe you could use them  got um a comforter and some pillows  and um another lamp  seeing how dark it gets in here  i just thought make you feel more at home  thank you thank you you didnt have to  wow you saved a lot of michaels stuff  you miss having him around  how about you is this your mom  yeah  die  who said she was dead  this uh photos been in your wallet a long time  looks like its well cared for  wow  uh yeah yeah  she actually passed away when i was 9  oh im sorry what happened  uh she was killed  during a robbery at a convenience store  she was working the graveyard shift  uh killer ran off with less than 50 bucks  and she bled out on the floor  there was people watching from the parking lot too  nobody did anything  so uh by the time the cops got there she was dead  now youve hooked up with michael  gonna try and save the world  something like that yeah  yeah sam  yeah let me get changed ill be right there  grabbing someone who travels with protection  is about finding the moments when theyre least protected  fortunately even the most paranoid gangster  insists on doing some things alone  executing a successful closequarters assault  is all about setting the stage  youll want to dull any reflective surfaces  corral your target into a corner  and hit him when hes most vulnerable  easy easy now  mm  nightnight  and it never hurts to have a prearranged exit strategy  you really think you can scare this dude  into pulling something thatll get him busted huh  oh i know i can  really cause you dont look that scary  you havent seen chuck finley in action  sorry coming through  somebody cant handle his liquor  you know who im with you know who i am  im a made guy  you touch me   youre gonna threaten me with the family  who do you think wants you dead  look you know as well as anyone you havent been earning  is it gio is gio behind this  you didnt hear it from me  wait a minute you dont want to do this  what do you want  money  i got 20 grand  youre funny  come on  if you wanted to kill me id be dead already  nah i just like the company  look its nothing personal  but i got a job to do here  or its my ass swinging in the wind  its just the way of the wild brother  you dont see the gazelle  bargaining with the lion do you  listen to me listen to me  hey hey hey  you dont want to wake the other guests do you  look if youre gonna keep bellyaching  while im shining mr slicey  were gonna have to go back to mr needle  wait a minute hold on a second  whats your name  chuck chuck  let me talk to new york ill clear it with them  no you know new york only listens in 50s and 100s  now look you got a couple mil you can kick upstairs maybe theyll listen  but seriously this is so much easier  hey hey i can get it i can get the money  yeah how  you got some kind of score that can pull down that kind of cash  i dont think so hey hey at the docks  yeah they got a big shipment coming in  oh its huge  i mean i was just gonna skim it  but you know we can hit the whole thing  5 mil easy  hmm  so youre just gonna waltz in there  and take 5 million off the docks by yourself  hey i got guys in my crew  no gio has guys in your crew  all right look im telling you i can do this  just give me 48 hours  ill cut you in  say a mil  now is not the time to write checks that you cant cash  no oh no no no  ill get you the money i swear  all right  fine   1 mil  cause i like you  all right run along now  but dont be a stranger you understand  cause if i have to find you again  im not gonna be so friendly  and neither will mr slicey  so check this out  i crossreferenced the documents we got at the docks  figured out which shipment belonged to our boy cobra  cobra  that name live with it  anyway the uh weapons  went from algerian ships in the port  onto the trucks  and they show up again at the opalocka airport  any idea where theyre headed  theres no way of telling the manifests were all forged  im trying to figure out which hangar they went to though  my guess is that cobra is working out of there  yeah sam howd it go with tony  yeah mike i got good news and bad news  good news is tonys gonna hit the docks  something big  bad news  well hes back at his place  making calls to his crew to pull off the score  i tried to convince him that he couldnt trust them  but i guess hes sentimental  well well just have to cure him of that wont we  right there with you mikey already called fi  convincing a general that he cant trust his soldiers  is an ancient and timehonored strategy  in ancient rome staging a botched assassination  usually involved poisoning a few slaves  today the same effect can be achieved  with a cheap cellphone and a brick of explosive  hey there  got your message whats up  you know how uh you said my guys couldnt be trusted  indeed i do  well you were right they just tried to take me out  well then we have a problem dont we  cause i seem to recall i was promised a million dollars  i can get the money all right  yeah yeah  how  you and me together we can do this  listen itll be a great score  you put the guys together   look if i put together the crew  my cuts gonna be a lot bigger than a mil  fine 2 million  thats more like it  all right tell you what  you come up with a plan ill make some calls  put together some manpower  all right ill be in touch  hey tony  im really glad i didnt cut you into little pieces  dont make me regret my decision huh  yeah mike its me  looks like im tonys new partner  hank its not that complicated  tonys gonna try to rob the docks  were gonna make sure he gets caught doing it  he gets busted his operation rolls up  and your problem goes away  wait but youre gonna actually help him do this  nothings gonna get stolen  we just have to make sure  that the mouse goes after the cheese  and when he does  shouldnt we talk to the police  look hank were not supposed to tell you this  tonys got an fbi agent in his pocket  hed just get tipped off this is how it has to be  all right what do i have to do  well thats the good part hank you get to be the hero  you get to be the one who stops the heist  sams gonna be meeting with tony later  you just go to work everything will be fine  yeah okay ill see you guys later  sams gonna need some backup  im there  fi you know as well as i do  that tonys going to be expecting sams righthand man  to be  wella man  looks like im coming off the bench then  now the shipments coming in there  usually wed just hit a few crates  but if we take this whole thing  its gonna be a hell of a score  whats in the crates microprocessors  you know the stuff they put in computers  street value  5 million  guess that would explain the security   the electric fence gate  rentacops  the shipments gonna be  in a box truck inside that warehouse  you guys can get in there youre gonna be able to drive right out  ill take care of the sales any  hold on  were going in there  yeah unhunh youre coming with us  uh  no no no no you dont understand  i dont do that stuff anymore  you see ive paid my dues im a boss  well my friend you will not be a boss for much longer  unless you plan on coming with us  im not doing it  look tony youre on a team with chuck he takes care of you  im not gonna do it he takes care   tell him about the time  you uh saved your navy seal buddy in el salvador  come on tell him man  it was the 80s uh  i led a factfinding team into the country  there were five of us including my buddy pete  course the uh death squads were none too happy to see us  so we came under fire and pete took one in the spine  he wanted me to dump him leave him behind  i sent the team ahead and pete and i hole up  in some church for a couple days  living off of communion wafers  finally a couple black hawks airlifted us out of there  the point is no man left behind  thats the promise i make the promise i keep  thats a hell of a story chuck  so what do you say you in  yeah im in lets do this  what the hell was that  what the story michael mentioned it  no its not just a story  this is me its my real life  i dont pimp my past to bad guys you understand  it worked didnt it  bingo bingo  hey michael its jesse i need to talk to you man  yeah i heard about what happened with sam  word to the wise  stay out of his war stories from now on  come on man the guys an exnavy seal  hes probably told that story a million times  thats not the point jesse  you know okay point taken  point taken thats not why i called  listen i think i found cobras warehouse at the airport  well i think we should get over there  yeah i think we should im gonna come pick you up  all right  freshbaked chocolate chips  hey  what word got out about my cookies huh  oh good  you heading out somewhere  yeah im gonna go meet michael  that doesnt narrow it down much  youre not gonna stop are you what  youre just gonna keep on pushing till you find out who i am  so you know what im gonna save us both some time all right  i was a counterintelligence agent  up until about a month ago when i was  fired  uh somebody used my security access  to steal some classified files  lucky for me your son was there to help me  was he  oh yeah yeah he saved my life  you raised a good man  you should know that  ill see you later all right  well if it is cobras hangar hes not here now  i wish he was just so we could ask him  what he thinks of the code name cobra  its the same tail number  as the plane he used to move his weapons  what do you think we could wait for him  just no telling when hed show up  one reason its tough to pull off the perfect crime  is destroying evidence leaves its own evidence  if a section of floor  has been cleaned with a powerful surfactant  it sticks out like a drop of bleach on a shirt  begging the question  what did someone go to so much trouble to clean  what is that grease  blood looks like somebody was dumping a body  think it was cobra that would explain why he disappeared  well if it was him hell be tough to find  dump a body this way  it just drops out of the sky when the landing gear deploys  guess were gonna have to track down the last place this baby flew  yeah were all set tony  the teams ready  oh youre excited uhhuh  wwell its not exactly like the mission in el salvador  ii guess theyre similar  yeah okay ill see you there  ugh the guy will not stop calling me  he thinks hes part of a frickin platoon now  aww he likes you sam  yeah i dont need friends like that  cause when this is over he wants me to kill  his whole crew families included  the guys a piece of work  whats up hank  hes gonna see me  look by the time he sees you hes gonna be halfway to prison  so just stick with the plan hank  itll be fine  this it this the whole team  i got a few others around  what about on the road looking out for cops  yeah around the perimeter too  dont worry i got it covered  all right were on the clock here  three minutes from the time we breach the fence  to the time we drive out  anything goes wrong we scatter and regroup  roger that  road team set  set  perimeter team set  set  sniper team set  set  i got eyes on security  south side of the building  take the shot  give them a flat tire  as they come around the corner  roger that  security car disabled copy that  okay were good to go  if youre cutting through a highpowered electric fence  you need more than rubber gloves  and a pair of thicksoled shoes  covering a fence with sprayon insulation  and using a set of fiberglasshandled bolt cutters  will keep you from lighting up like a christmas tree  hold on there chuck all right youre clear  a shape charge large enough to go through a wall  is also large enough to let everyone for several miles  know what youre doing  a smaller charge can be just as useful  and a lot less noisy  a hydraulic spreader puts out enough pressure  to rip a door off a humvee  placed correctly it will make short work  of reinforced concrete  5 million its a beautiful thing  we can admire it later  get it started lets get out of here  we got two minutes  all right ill get the guard to open the gate  you meet me on the other side you got it  ill be there  okay hank this is it open the gate  you sure about this  look weve already called in the stolen truck  every cop in miami is gonna be waiting for him  about a mile from the port  but hes not gonna be there unless you open the gate now  good  take my gun and lead me out  you sell this were home free  just point the end with the hole at me  and uh try not to shake too much  go get out of here  is it over  yeah will be soon  cops should be closing in shortly  mike whats going on  jesse and fi clear  all clear  you got a visual on tony  looking good sam  he stopped sam somethings wrong  what do you mean he stopped  a spys job is to get into the heads of his adversary  to know how hell behave and use it against him  but human behaviors about as predictable as the weather  sometimes the most hardened criminal  can decide to be noble at the most inconvenient time  looks like tony  had second thoughts about leaving you behind  what hes coming back sam  okay hank i got to hit you in a second  and when i do you run like hell and dont look back  wait ii dont need y  what the hell happened  leave no man behind right  you didnt leave your buddy in el salvador  and im not leaving you  the truck is trashed we got to get out of here  come on lets go  hang on  i dont hear the sirens anymore  i think we can stop running  what happened back there my gun jammed the guy got the drop on me  what the hell are we gonna do  i dont know what to tell you  you got a big problem here tony  look maybe you should just run just get the hell out of town  no no no no im not gonna lam it  youve got new york after you  look we caught a bad break today  but you and me we make a great team  you got a good crew  come on we can do something here make a move  what are you trying to say tony  you and me we take out gio  i take over show new york whos boss  wait a second  youre trying to get me to help you kill gio  im telling you thisll work  we take him out his guys everyone  hey how many bodies you gonna drop here  as much as it takes tried to kill me  im telling you thisll work  we hit em hard leave no one alive  come on listen  gio and his crew go to the track every friday  we can hit him then  all we need is cars muscle and guns  come on are we in huh  youre in lets go  okay i am now officially the closest friend  of a total psychopath  this is great this is just great  i dont even want this  so what did you say  well what could i say i told him i would think about it  i mean what the hell we gonna do now  he wants to go after gios crew and start a war  all because his best buddy chuck  was such a standup guy back in el salvador  all right so lets let him start a war  we wanted tony to stick his neck out right  its just as easy to get him busted for going after gio  as it is to get him busted for ripping off some warehouse  tell me hes joking we dont have a lot of other choices sam  im not saying i love the idea  but it could help hank get out from under tonys thumb  i kind of like it actually  taking out half of miamis wiseguys in one afternoon  we havent done that before  look i hate to be the naysayer here  but tony is expecting an army  and last time i checked we dont have an army  ohh  oh well give him an army  creating the illusion of force  is one of the oldest tricks in warfare  the rise of the private security guard  has made it a lot easier  post a job opening on the internet in the morning  and by lunch you can have a whole platoon  of muscular guys in black blazers   huh  lose the jacket let me see em  hmm  youve got a job  hire some heavy duty suvs  to put your security force in place  next  and itll look just like  youve got troops ready for battle  all right you guys are gonna follow the lead car  to this spot okay  singlefile line keep it tight lets go  you ready to do this yes i am you wont regret this  once im the boss im gonna need some guys   good guys  i wont forget what you did for me im sure you wont  now look as soon as we see gio  my snipers are gonna put a few slugs through his engine block  we drive up you pop out with that bad boy  you let gio know whos running the show here  my snipers have got you covered  and im behind you all the way  all right lets do this  youre the boss will be soon anyway  weve got eyes on gio  okay lets light him up  military leaders since the citystates of early greece  have known that a tried and tested method  for getting rid of an adversary  is to provoke him to attack a more powerful enemy  provide an ambitious adversary  with the backing of a seemingly invincible army  and hes bound to go hunting for even his toughest rival  get out you son of a bitch  and face me like a man  tony what the hell are you doing  you think you can take me out  cause i was a few dollars short  what the hell are you talking about  okay lets move  ill tell you what im talking about  im mixing things up right now  i got a new crew and i got a new way of doing things  and this towns got a new boss  me  chuckget up here  making sure your adversary is eliminated  chuck what are you doing  then becomes about pulling that backing  once hes declared war on his rival  chuck  when its too late for him to take it all back  you just made a very big mistake tony  you mother  on the docks  and theyre only getting started  about tony  what happened  hes in the miamidade prison hospital  charged with killing gio  i dont think anyone will be hearing from him for a while  what happens when people start asking questions  about the security team that cleaned up the docks  what should i say  uh  probably best if you dont say anything  some stories you just dont tell  so got some information on that cargo plane  that was in the hangar at uh opalocka  last flight  the bahamas  and wouldnt you know it  same day a john doe washed ashore  ah i should head down there and check it out  fiona has some connections  she can make some arrangements  what you can get me off
