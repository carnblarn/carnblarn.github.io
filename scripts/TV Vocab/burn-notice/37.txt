                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you  youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  a old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  names tom strikler  what is it that you do tom  a bit like an agent  like i told you before  im not interested in your money  its all about the burn notice with you isnt it  i think i might be able to help with that  the fact that hes a weasel doesnt give you pause  it doesnt feel right promise me youll walk away  fi i have to go  you do this and you have my word  the power that be will review your burn notice  for you happy birthday  yeah michael  i just got a call from washington  theres been some movement on your burn notice  this is just the beginning supertar  working with someone like strikler  it changes you little by little  i just cant stay here in miami and watch  fi  fiona  when you work as a covert operative  theres no line between who you are and what you do  you are who you need to be for the operation  it makes you effetive it keeps things simple  but when you spend too much time living as someone else  sometimes the people you care about most  begin to wonder who you really are  michael  im upstair fi  whats that youre driving  it didnt sound like your car outside  its a rental  i sold my car  really  your car didnt exactly have a pink slip  oh the buyer didnt mind not at that price  this um  this movingoutoftown thing  if youre trying to make a point  im not trying to make a point michael  im trying to make a change  im going home  i told my mother to expect me  we had one fight and you decide to go back to ireland  this isnt about one fight michael  if you didnt see this coming  then you werent paying attention  youre too worried about your own future  for there to be one for us  im not doing this for me  fiona im out in the cold and the longer i stay there  the more i endanger everyone in my life  dont you pretend this is about us  its about you  which is fine  its its just time i i did what i need to do too  michael  yeah  have you seen my hk usp compact  the one with the ilver slide

someone must have made themselves  a powerful new friend  its not every day  the guy running the agency warehouse in miami  get a call from the deputy director  so your file just landed on his desk  so this is being taken seriously  over my strenuous objection  but i seem to be the only one  who thinks this is a waste of the agencys time  great  so uh will you be the one running my review  im just the liaison  various regional experts will be doing your review  theyll get to tear apart the story  of poor misunderstood michael westen  and put you on the blacklist for good  you know if i were you diego  id start preparing myself for disappointment  funny  i was gonna give you the same advice  ill be calling you to set up the first meeting soon  dont you want to wish me luck  not really  but im suppoed to tell you to stay out of trouble  youre tiptoeing through a minefield  theres a reason spies try to stay detached  when you get emotional about something  even if its just your exgirlfriends  45caliber handgun you get distracted  and getting distracted can be very very dangerous  michael  you remember my brother sean  you met back in ireland  michael mcbride  its been a while  last i saw you you were saving my sister  from those english bastards that had her pinned down in belfast  spies need to remember every cover id theyve ever worn  because you never know when you might need to put one back on  yeah  it was a good thing they were such lousy hot  otherwie fiona and i  would have been saying our last hail marys together  glad youre here  we ould use another man who can shoot a gun  whys that  its bad news mcbride  someones coming to kill my sister  this is it dont you have any real guns  i am in the middle of a move  all of my big toys are packed up on a boat  waiting to be smuggled back  americas taken its toll sis  youve lost your edge and your acent  oneill is looking for an irishwoman  im not gonna hold up a neon sign that says  here i am come blow my head off  look im way behind  and it sounds like i cant afford to be  so start from the beginning  his name is thomas oneill  one of those ultraradical bastards  the kind of man who would blow up a church on a sunday  kind of man id love to kiss with a chain saw  and why does he want you dead fi  its a long story  talk quickly then  you dont need a history lesson mcbride  all that matters is oneills  supposed to be making his move today  and were not suitably armed  ill make a call i know someone who delivers  well need some proper hardware how quick can they get here  not quick enough is that him  thats thomas oneill  bloodthirsty hooligan got here faster than i expected  we need to move now  no  im gonna teach the son of a bitch how to breathe  through the top of his skull  were outnumbered do the math  they think fionas alone  we can dig in surprise them  no we cant thats a trained extraction team  we leave now or we die  theres one on the corner he didnt see us  well hes seen us now  they came out the back  shes on foot and shes not alone  spread out sweep the neighborhood  come on ome on come on  we need a car now  ill get us one stay here  you never told him  no michael not even a glenanne  would forgive me for working with an amerian spy  everyone at home still thinks youre from kilkenny  sean can never know  dont worry he wont  he better not  hey mike how you  sam we have a situation  someones in town trying to kill fi  her brother sean has ome into town to protect her  so we need a place to lay low  jesus okay let me make a call  thanks and sam  what have i told you about my time in ireland  uh not much mike  well my name is michael mcbride  and youre just gonna have to roll with it  you must be sean im sam axe  okay sam whats your background  were doing background checks now  mcbride knows me  well i dont know you so why dont  thats enough sean i trust him  fiona trusts him now so do you  we good here  yeah its a new foreclosure  my realestate buddy  doesnt expect anybody here for at least a month  better not take that long to get rid of oneill  so why is this guy so hot for you fi  i thought you bit the heads off all your old boyfriends  i met oneill  while i was looking for the man who killed my sister  you had a sister  you never mentioned that before  i dont like to talk about it  there were seven of us five boys two girls  claire was the youngest  when she was taken i was angry and i was loud  oneill thought i was as radical as he was  and he told me about a bombing  he was planning at a prep school  and you made sure those explosives  never made it to the target  a few years later he resurfaced and came after me  its one of the reasons that i left home  after fi left oneill disappeared again  i hoped hed blown himself up  but then word got out fi was in touch with folks in dublin  suddenly oneills back on the grid and on his way to miami  right fiona  you and sean will stay at the house  sam and i to hell with that  with four of us looking well find him much faster  he know you and sean  mcbride if you think youre dealing with him all by yourself  well discuss the dealing when we do the finding  but sam and i are doing the finding  first you say run now you say hide  i crossed an ocean to tear a mans limbs off  sean  theres no point in fighting with him  trust me  i am not one of your damn clients  so do we love this place or what  i almost didnt go for it  but then i thought im worth it  well you are strikler  look uh my day just got crazy so  oh no time for a tour huh  uh well whenever youre ready itll be here  so uh you know how this is gonna work right  apparently theyre gonna look at my activities  when i was regularly employed  but i get to set the record straight  yeah well straightish might be a better term  what does that mean  well theyre delicate issues  phrases to avoid phrases to employ  it needs proper handling  truth doesnt need handling  the truth  oh come on  you are not in the truth business michael  you never were  look partner have to trust each other  so trust me when i say  that right now your reputation is valuable  people fear you  we can use that to make you money  michael did you really think  rebuilding a reputation would be free  money greases palms opens doors buys documents  and it puts michael westen right back where he wants to be  now understand  this project is very delicate so lets not break it  im gonna send you some paperwork tomorrow  your side of the story  study up  hey mikey  this is thomas oneills interpol file  yeah you think a guy who crossed an ocean to kill fi  would have a file with a little more meat on its bones  thats it  i thought he was upposed to be this oneman  ultraradical splinter group  well hes got the reputation but not the rap sheet  this looks like hes not tied to anything  he isnt  interpol thinks hes freelancing  they like him for about 12 bombings in europe  all with the same chemical signature  but nobody can pin anything on the guy  oneill has some known associate in the state  theyre money guys  one of them just bought a condo in south beach  my bet is its not a vacation home  we should get eye on it  what are you two doing would you put those things away  mom wait mom  hey come on in  boys this is tiffany  hi tiffany ward tiffany ward realty  mom are you selling the house  i was thinking about it  and with you about to get your old job back  and fi heading home  i just thought maybe it was about time that i made a change myself  can we start in the bedrooms  sure yeah theyre in the back  i raised two boys here  the way they behaved it was more like four  so i think a large family can live here very comfortably  this house is just filled with so much love and and  not now mikey we got to go  im just saying mike its okay if your head is spinning  i mean first its your girl now its your childhood home  i never liked that house  yeah but you like fiona right  theres oneill  why does it look like the sons of the lucky harms revolution  are getting ready for battle  because he know fiona is on his tail  thats her in the sedan  aw crap  she must have tracked oneill through his miami connections  she went around me  mike she thinks that hes alone  she has no idea what shes getting into  its gonna be world war iii down there  oneill is mine  ill give you first shot but when you miss  because you broke a nail or dropped your purse  ill step in and clean him up for you  shes not picking up  sam give me the keys to the car  thats miss reynolds car  the keys now  no dont mike  hello gorgeous ive been waiting for this  they knew we were coming  no aw  what the hell  back inside now  sorry about the buik sam there was just no other way  oh just dont  what part  of sam and i will do the finding was unclear  you get on my page now or someones getting killed  no more ignoring your phone no more running off without  mcbride stop your lecturing why do you think were here  we came to apologize and say thanks  i mean im not thrilled that the bastards still breathing  but im im glad that we are  sam oh please  ive been dodging miss reynolds calls for an hour  im sure the cops ran the plates on the buick told her  oh wait here we go  oh yeah thats her again  now that we found oneill  how exactly are we dealing with him  well he needs to find you  hell want to talk to anyone who could help him with that  which gives me the in i need  to get him and his whole team busted by the police  mcbride you cant just walk right up to him  as soon as you open your mouth and he hear youre irish  ill approach him as an amerian with a deal  really  sure you can pull that off  ive gone undercover  as an amerian before  ill be fine  i dont know  your accents a bit dodgy  uh the uninvited  could at least have the decency to introduce himself  my names unimportant  youre sitting at the wrong table  fellas get him out of here i assure you im not  this is the planning committee for the glenanne wake right  easy  what are you gonna do you gonna play me a song with that  whats he gonna do  funny  i want you to tell me if you recognize this voice  oneill should be in the ground  he and his bloody army were ready for us  we need to leave town now  i own a company im an arms dealer  if it goes boom or bang  or helps unhappy people kill each other i sell it  miss glenanne works for me  yeah whatever pal  i couldnt care less about your business  i want to know how you come to have her voice on tape  my line of work breeds distrust  which i why i monitor communiations  what did i hear when i listened in on miss glenanne  an irishman named thomas oneill  has come with a small army to miami to kill her  you got a lot of brass on you fella  ill give you that  now it wont surprise you to learn  i can make her appear whenever i want wherever i choose  well mr magic man  if you make her appear now ill buy you a mighty fine drink  i wish it were that simple  but shes doing a job for me  if she diappears  i need someone to do what she no longer can  i was thinking of you  i dont deal with people i dont know  you should get to know me  i dont think i will  i found her once ill find her again  well  if that doesnt work out for you call me  slinte  slinte  i thought the irish were impulsive  okay so where are we if he doesnt go for your proposition  in need of a backup plan  well maybe we should ask fi  she might have a perspective that we dont  thats the realestate lady  butch sundance cool it  hey make sure to tell her  about the quality craftmanship in the new sunroom  hi you here about the house  no im here about your son  can michael come out and play  what the hell are you doing here  exactly what i said i would do  delivering your study material  here it is  exactly what youre going to tell our friends at the cia  you want me to say i worked a job helping a somali warlord  somali businessman yeah  its an intelligence asset  it was a real operation  lucky for us all the us operatives died  so nobody can say you werent there  lines up perfectly with your time in africa  and it helps me to set up a little side projet  i have here in miami  what side job  too early to talk details  lets focus on the uh the businessman  hes agreed to vouch  for your unimpeachable conduct on the job  for a price which i will pay  no sale  im not clearing my name  by getting in bed with a murderer  stop being so naive  youre just replacing one lie with another  and this lie washes you clean  nothing about this is clean  you need to realize that this isnt about  telling the world the truth about michael westen  this is about getting your old job back  in the end what does it matter  oh and please tell your mom sorry about the drapes  they looked better in the catalog honestly  you take that well talk later  yeah  its oneill  ive had a change of heart lets meet  he didnt say why  no  he just said oneill called him and we needed to be ready  fiona why are you coming home without mcbride  people are who they are  they dont change just cause you want them to  so youre still in love with him  you ready  of course  where we headed i need oneill to deliver a package for me  what package a little gift  with a big prison sentence attached to it  lets go michael  you know i i lost one sister  i i cant lose another  i want to thank you for protecting fiona  youre an honest man  and im honored to be fighting beside you  im glad you came to your senses  well well see  now talk  its simple  ill give you miss glenannes location  you get to kill her  i deliver you the girl  and in return you deliver a shipment of assault rifle  to one of my buyers  i got a better idea  fellas  im gonna shoot little bit off you until you tell me where she is  where do you want it first  you want your elbow or your bloody kneecap  i really dont have time for this  put the gun down or ill have you put down  im not sure youve taken stock of the situation  well there you go eh  you couldnt be trusted so i brought insurance  take your hands off me and put the gun down  gun going down  very good you can follow orders  now tell me we have a deal  if you stop lighting me up like a little christmas tree  then just maybe we will have a deal yes  all right thats the signal turn them off  sean what are you doing

your last chance partner  or the deal die right here  so do you get this thing off me  sean  that wasnt so difficult was it  yeah well talk soon  oh  thats everything on your list  time to bring thomas oneills monster to life  meet oneills signature bomb  hes trotted that thing out 12 times and never been caught  lets make lucky number 13  the one that links him to all his uncredited work  fiona you remember jack tracey  from the bicycle shop by the churh  just got off the phone with him  the old guy he was good to us  right real plugged in to the underground  well hes got bad news  theres a rumor that oneills  taking you home putting you up for sale  sounds like theres a number of folks with sample reason  to hate fiona glenanne already showing an interest  that could be a lot of people  it seems oneills looking to raise his profile back home  thinks youre his ticket  i should have forefed him a bullet when i had the chance  if you had you two would be having this conversation alone  i could have put them all down mcbride  i had a clear shot did you have five clear shots  i think youre overestimating your ability  to hit five moving targets  you think so i know so  well how about i  how about you shut up  we have work to do  bomb makers like master chefs tend to have a signature dish  if you can duplicate it  you can leave their fingerprints wherever you want  some bombs are designed to remove an obstacle  some bombs are designed to be loud and scary  while other bombs are just designed to kill and maim  rat poison  it contains an anticoagulant  he like his victims to hemorrhage and bleed out  he want them to suffer  he does it for the headlines  and the picture plashed on the front page  he blow up people just to spread fear  go  pick up some screws while youre there  you two play nice  you think you can handle that  gues well find out mcbride  michael  hey mom sorry i missed your calls  i came by to see if you needed anything  sure you did  thats why youre in here stealing all my screw  its all right i dont need to know  lets just pretend that youre helping me clean my garage  for my open house  that sounds good  so uh any other big life change  you want to tell your son about  what i thought youd be thrilled  i know you never wanted to come back to this house again  no i didnt but thats me  youre the one who always insited  that every ingle memory we had here was a good one  or did you suddenly change your mind  maybe i finally decided to move on michael  its something i learned from my son no doubt  anyway  i didnt want to feel bad about throwing this stuff out  without showing it to you first okay  i just i ran across it when i was showing tiffany around  my model airplane yeah  theres another box just like it inside in the closet  you dont want this stuff anymore  i was hoping that you would michael  this isnt gonna make any sense to you  but um most people normal people  go through their life colleting boxes like this  i just dont want you to ever look back  and regret letting this stuff go  now if youre convinced that you never will  i will throw it away for you  ill just ill ill take a look  oh well ill go get the other box  well this is gonna make oneill  look like hes got one hell of an interest  in the basement of the state department  hes gonna have a lot of explaining to do  thats the noose  so you think this slippery irihsmans  gonna stick his head in  if we want to get him busted  we need to put him behind the wheel of this van  and if he wont do it on his own  well have to just gently encourage him  mcbride ill be right there  right sean  thats the last of what you packed  its such a shame to leave so much behind  i was just getting comfortable  i know youre trained to walk away from everything  in 30 minutes or less but  its not easy for everyone  i cant believe in a few days im gonna wake up back home  and youll be you again fi  i wonder what it will be like  youll have your friends there and your family  they dont know me anymore  youre still the same person  no im not  who i am now  has so much to do with what ive done here  what ive done with you  fi  i  its okay

for suspects  when you realize that an operation is compromised  that your enemies are on the move youre on a clock  you have to move as fast as you can  to try to contain the damage  and harden your defense before its too late  sometimes you make it in time  and sometime you dont  when you work in intelligence  the worst feeling in the world is knowing nothing  being caught up in something  you dont begin to understand  beause its not the enemy you see that gets you  its the one you dont
