                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them   an old friend whos informing on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too is that your mom again   if youre desperate im gonna need your help  bottom line until you figure out who burned you   youre not going anywhere  a surveillance photo  can tell you a lot about the photographer  surveillance takes planning you have to scout the area  you need a place to sit  and wait for the target for an hour or 10  you need to take a leak now and then  lots of chances to get seen  michael good to see you  you cant choose your intelligence sources  might be a heroin smuggler a dictator or your mom  i was beginning to wonder if you were gonna be standing  in the road all day or come in for a visit  i need to ask you something  anyone unknown to you  been around the house last few months  any unfamiliar faces on the street  maybe a repair truck that just seemed to sit there  i dont know  i really dont notice what my neighbors do  im not interested in them  youd notice if the neighbor hasnt vacuumed his car  if the postman isnt wearing his wedding ring  just tell me  as a matter of fact  a few months ago there were two men here taking pictures  they were very nice  you met them  mmhmm they came in for coffee  i made them deviledegg sandwiches  they were in some sort of  i dont know some government something  wait wait wait government something  who exactly do they work for how should i know  all these years i dont know who in the hell you work for  travel all over the world  saying oh cant talk about it  well i dont have a job anymore  so theres nothing you have to worry about  what did they talk to you about what did they ask  i dont know but i did show one of them the garden  wait you left one alone in here how long  hmm i dont remember  the doctor says whats wrong with me  could be affecting my memory  your memorys fine  if theres anyone who could use a little memory loss its you  my mothers understanding of my career  changes with what she wants from me  one day she can name everyone on the national security council  the next day she thinks i work for the post office  well my friend donna in my bridge group  shes had memory problems  which reminds me  i want to talk to you about a friend of mine  in a sec  michael what are you doing  not all bugs are the same  if its got a battery its disposable shortterm  if its wired into the house power  its a longerterm thing  if it has a transmitter  you can figure out how close the listener is  mom are there any empty houses in the neighborhood  within say hmm 350 meters  across the street two doors down  once your surveillance knows youre onto them  the clock starts ticking  they know youre coming so the question for them  is whether they can destroy their equipment  and get out of there in time  the question for you is whether you can find them  before every bit of useful information  is turned into a pile of burning slag  what happened to you you smell like burnt plastic  yeah i think theres a fire down the road  um and the smoke had drifted  mom we need to talk about the men who came to the house  i need to know what they asked you what you told them  its important for my job  i thought you didnt have a job  yeah you know its its hard to explain  yeah well i dont remember  this thing about my friend has me very upset  its hard to think about anything else  fine mother lets talk about your friend  well its my neighbor laura  all right  these people came over to her house with some kind of a scam  they got all of her bankaccount numbers  they took everything that she has  and they beat her up michael shes terrified  well what am i supposed to do  well youll think of something  she lives right across the street  you could go there now  i talk to your friend  and then we talk about the men who came to the house  thank you so much for coming  when madeline said you could help me  i was so relieved  well what happened exactly  i got a letter about a month ago  uh said id won a prize one of those magazine things  i called and they congratulated me  said they had to send some people over  to fill out some tax forms  and they came over and  there were two men and a woman  they were in such a hurry to get my information  credit cards bank accounts  i got nervous and i asked them to leave  i tried to call the police and they hit me broke my arm  i checked my bank account its all gone  its all i had  uh do you do you have anything that uh  do you have a description of them  oh im not very good at that sort of thing  the main one he was goodlooking blond  the other two were just regular with brown hair  regularlooking with brown hair  i have the prize letter  my son wants to put me in a home now  thinks i cant be trusted  uh ill see what i can do  im gonna need to borrow this okay  i should go  im gonna go  so youre helping old ladies now  good for you mike  hey i saw a kitten up a tree on my way over here  they beat her up took her life savings  you in or not  well you put it that way what can i say  whats the plan  the address and phone number are fake  but the printing the foil embossing  there cant be more than one place in miami  that does that kind of work  sounds good  uh listen the money on this one will be a little thin  well its a public service hey how about a trade  i had a little disagreement  with the lady friend i was staying with  and i could use a place to crash  three days i was thinking more like a week  mike look i can sweeten the pot on this  if im staying with you the feds will be off your back  ill just tell them that im babysitting you  five days you bring a sleeping bag  and youre out by the weekend  done  hello michael  fi youre here  i came by for a visit  the door was locked so i broke in  new accent  new style  well im in miami now  i cant very well be talking  like a freakin leprechaun now can i  this is the new me michael  for now  so youre staying in town then thats great  listen fi nows not a really good time for you to be  oh jesus mike you didnt tell me she was gonna be here  you cost me a lot of money you son of a bitch  ive been waiting to talk to you  i cost you  okay for starters  what youre talking about never officially happenedall right  but unofficially even if it had  you deserved a hell of a lot worse than what you got lady  sam  theres a reason spies dont have a lot of parties  everybodys got a history with everyone else  that was a legitimate purchase  the us government has no business  yeah legitimate a libyan arms dealer  how do you figure that  whoa whoa whoa whoa  fi im thrilled that youve come by  but sam and i need to talk about a job so you need  a job hmm  that sounds like fun  im in  yeah  man i do work like that yeah  i dont remember this piece but we do a lot of volume  you need more like this with the foil embossing  yeah i mean i dont know a lot about printing  but something like that  you got some big machines  oh just upgraded stateoftheart  want me to show you around mmhmm  often the best way to get intel  is to provoke action set people in motion  pros know better  but they usually have to work with a few amateurs  and they panic  so you beat the bushes a little and see what flies out  once your frightened amateur leads you to the pros  the work begins  con artists and spies are both professional liars  cons do it for the money and spies do it for the flag  but its mostly the same gig  they run operations they follow security procedures  they recruit support staff and issue orders  hey so this guy quentin your con artist  hangs out at a club down in south beach called onyx  its nice  want me to go down there and do some surveillance  no i think were fine  i got a cover id for you mikey  how do you like the name peter jordan  would you put some pants on  what i work better when i can breathe down there  i mean do you want to hear about this guy or no  yeah tell me about peter jordan  he was cell mates with an expartner of quentins  he jumped parole about a month ago  they caught him  hes in a phoenix holding cell  but they havent put him back through the system yet  he kind of looks like you too you know more or less  not bad for a man in his underwear  hey you think thats good you should see me without them  when you go after a spy you send another spy  the same goes for con artists  to catch one youve got to beat him at his own game  be a better liar than he is  excuse me can i help you  quentin king right  yeah  we have a mutual friend up in new york paco  few weeks ago  im at a dog track in newark freezing my nuts off  when i remember that paco said if i ever got down to miami  i should look you up  so im thinking hell anywheres nicer than newark  so i got my ass down to miami peter jordan hey  peter you got the wrong guy  no no i dont think so  see i was roommates with your buddy paco for a year  he told me about that job you pulled off up in tampa  real nice  i have a business opportunity i want to discuss with you  no matter how good your cover identity is  youve got to sell it and thats not always easy  like i said you got the wrong guy  i dont know you i dont know this paco  hey i went to a lot of trouble to find you  i got a warrant on my ass will you hear me out  im in waterfilter sales  now you want a water filter i can help you out  i dont want to argue with you  but whats a waterfilter salesman  doing with a 45 inside a shoulder holster  thats my business but you know what is your business  theres a couple of cops  that are sitting over there by the bar  been there a while probably liquor license  how about i bring them over here  and we talk about the terms of your parole  sometimes you have to decide just how committed you are  to pretending you are who you say you are  anyone ever tell you youre hard at making friends  paco said you had some issues  but i like to give people a chance its just how i am  this is what happens youre gonna get us out of here  because i like miami and im not going back to jail  so if those cops even look at me  well see how many slugs i can put through your liver  before they take me down  i got 20 bucks on 4 you want to take the over or the under  all right lets go out back  smile stand up  put your arm around me  and act like the friends i wanted us to be  all right here we are  you want to take that thing out of my ribs now  oh and then you send the cops right after me uhhuh  i dont like running from cops but it has its advantages    when you flee a crime scene  ill be in touch  eavesdropping and fieldwork go hand in hand  you want to know what your target is saying  and what hes typing into his computer  but technology cant work miracles  bugs dont plant themselves  the fact is even the fanciest equipment  usually needs help from a good oldfashioned crowbar  get onto the boat plant the bugs get out quick  yep gotcha okay whats that for  i could think of something  its for the lock if you have trouble sam  mike give me some credit i mean i can handle a lock  quentin had a colt 45  with extended controls and a beveled mag well  hes serious be careful sam  yeah fi i want you to fix quentins car  so we can disable it if anything happens  you think you can handle that  im not gonna answer that  im off to make friends  its me again  do me a favor babe take a swim  waters great  you want a drink  it depends  am i talking to quentin king or some waterfilter salesman  you could be a cop you could be a fed you could be anyone  im not just anyone  well you can handle yourself ill give you that  so you have something  if you burn me  lets hear your proposal  youll meet my team well see  theres your gun back  its always useful to be able to disable a car remotely  a cellphone some wire  you can ground the circuit on the electrical system  with a phone call  are you just about done down there  in a second  this is an art  no wiring crap into a car is not an art  its about as subtle as hitting someone with a brick  hitting someone with a brick takes a lot of skill  you should try it sometime its all in the wrist  sorry not my style  i know thats right i forgot  you only do what the suits tell you  you know that was a cheap shot  a good cover identity keeps the target feeling in control  you talk too much drink too much  just to let him know hes got the edge  i respect what youre doing  going after checking accounts consumer credit  i mean its easy  its like picking up coconuts on the beach  i like coconuts as much as the next guy  but im talking about something bigger than coconuts  enough with the coconuts whats the scam  annuities  you sell someone an annuity and they dig deep  home equity major assets  the money theyre saving up for their grandkids  you give them a piece of paper  and you walk away with everything they own  why do you need us  youve got leads  what was your hit rate on your last scam 1 in 50  you go back to every one you missed you nail one in five   i got tax documents marketing stuff  and a bottle of johnnie walker blue  and were done  well you know were making money  and this forge crap feds are all over that  but 100 grand per mark dude thats millions  greg take a walk  okay  listen you dont want this i dont want this  in fact i dont need this no no no ill walk away  i want to talk about this come on lets talk  lets talk about it  you boys and your computers  if youve got a better way  to find encrypted passwords and account information  im all ears baby  here you go stick that up there and hurry up about it  wed have been out of here 10 minutes ago  if you didnt argue about every little thing  ive heard surveillance through these things  it sounds like everyones underwater  hey if you have a way  to put a recording studio in a light fixture love to hear it  millions of dollars  quentin acts like im a goddamn kid and tells me to go home  uhoh  what the hell are you doing here  what are you doing here  we live here  wha  you  you live here  oh god you liar you liar  you son of a bitch  i can explain baby  explain what  that you told me you had a yacht so you could get in my pants  is that about right  im sorry baby oh  i cant believe this  this is our third date  he said this was his boat  get out  wheres my shoe  here oh  you are taking me home right now  we are leaving we are leaving  okay jesus ow  were so sorry about this  lets go  and eventually we got out of there  anyway its all good  it was just a little painful in the end  of course it wouldnt have been a problem if i didnt have  someone secondguessing me and slowing the whole thing down  it was fine michael next time ill check my phone  hey howd it go is quentin your new best buddy  hardly ive cracked exkgb officers easier than this guy  were gonna have to push these guys  drive his little team apart  old school you know i like that  do you want the fullon disinformation campaign  no keep it small just enough to nudge him in my direction  can do who wants another beer  me  fi  yes  i need a favor  i need some information from my mom  shes not gonna talk about it unless we  go to dinner  i talked to her yesterday  you talked to her of course you did  and i accepted bringing a vegetable  i cant wait  go after a group of people directly  and they pull together they get stronger  taking out a tightknit group  is about making them turn on each other  plant the seeds of distrust and watch them grow  im still thinking about it  i talked to greg and bonnie  enough about greg and bonnie theyre not in charge here  fine im just saying we cant delay this much longer  tax season is coming up  if people buy in they do it just before april  so you and paco  you were cell mates what a year  i could think of worse ways to do time  paco man he still make that pruno  i did a couple months with him in county  and man he made the best prison wine  of course sowing seeds of distrust  is harder when nobody trusts you  paco doesnt drink what are you trying to pull  yeah  of course i forgot  what so you just guessed  either he drank or he didnt  and i guessed right  good thing  i think he was planning on shooting me if i got it wrong  ah nice work mike  hows the betrayal paper trail coming  oh great its actually some of my best work  i got plane tickets for greg and bonnie  and a couple of offshore bank accounts  ill get it over there tonight and plant it  now are you seriously taking fiona to your moms  not like i have a choice  good luck with that brother  fi just do me a favor  just

asked about you how often you come to miami  whether you have any friends here  and they asked if we were close  you and me what did you tell them  i told them that you were the perfect son  that you always wrote me and you called me all the time  and that the most important thing to you was family  i told them that and they wrote it down  why did you tell them that  i dont know michael  it just seemed nicer than the truth  excuse me i got a phone call  were you in on this answer me  calm down what are you talking about  answer me  i dont know  i got bank statements plane tickets huh  greg and bonnie had some plans  sometimes a great plan  comes together just a little bit too early  what you thought you could go around me  is that what you thought huh  why would i do that yeah you think about it  i need your leads without that i got nothing  greg and bonnie two stupid kids id have to share my score with  you know what im saying  i swear to god if i find out youre lying to me  i tell u the truth   this might not be what it looks like  they got a goddamn bottle of champagne  they were gonna rip me off  and go to the caymans or the seychelles    just dont do anything without me  this will be over tonight  youve been in the business way too long  when you recognize the sound of a 45 caliber over a phone  dont do anything stupid  okay mike im here im at the marina  if quentin leaves the boat  our plan is in serious trouble  yeah hes here i can see him walking around on the boat  youve got to make sure he doesnt go anywhere  dont worry about it ill keep an eye on him  hes planning to kill greg and bonnie  then blow out of town with the money  hang on what do you see  hes coming out right now  ill use fionas gizmo ill just zap the car  call me when its done all right  thats what happens when you wire a cellphone  to a blasting cap in the gas tank  instead of to the electrical system  son of a bitch  fiona you were supposed to stop the car  not blow it into the everglades  what happened to shorting the ignition  well you said disable its not going anywhere  you know what i meant  i almost had him i was this close  the fbi is back i see im under surveillance again  sam i thought you were supposed to handle that  mike theres only so much i can do  i got to tell the suits why were down at the marina  to keep them off our back  but if somebody starts blowing up cars down at the marina  youre friends with someone who put the fbi back onto you  that is so unfair  sam what about quentin  you were supposed to nudge him  not send him into a homicidal frenzy  look you guys were off doing your thing  so i signed up greg and bonnie through this medallion airways  executive service to the cayman islands  you know as part of the setup  well they got this new thing  where they overnight a bottle of champagne to the new members  quentin started sniffing around  and in less than an hour he found everything that i did  it was little stuff but he put it all together  turn him around make him trust you  hes not in a trusting mood fi  i know youre angry michael  but i know that an exploding car  can throw a man offbalance  youll thank me  he wont even talk to me he wont even answer my calls  well youll have to be extra charming  whether youre in moscow tehran or miami  club girls are a good source of information  men say things to a beautiful woman

spending  cash scrounged from your moms purse  you have to help me out please please  were doing this night at a club in hollywood beach amazing  i mean im flying in a dj from berlin  its gonna be

this  we have all the financial transactions off your computer  so your partner  we dont know okay hes just gone  too bad  theres no deal for you if he doesnt show up  you go down for the whole show  miami juries  they dont like people who rob retirees and beat up grandmas  that wasnt us that was quentin  we never touched them  quentin was the one smacking them around  we dont even have the money  quentin transferred it all to his own account shut up  of course you could help us find him  testify for a reduced sentence  and only get i dont know 5 to 10  i want to talk to a lawyer  go ahead  dont take too long and dont go anywhere  you know for all your antigovernment speechifying  you do lady cop pretty well  thanks  okay so you bet they would be gone by 400  well another couple minutes after that im 20 bucks richer  ill win  greg comes on strong when you can tell hes scared of prison  hes selling her on the sandy beaches of canc right now  mexico you think  or the caribbean  uhoh  okay there they go  dont look so smug  i dont much like dealing with paranoids  they get erratic make bad decisions  that could be a help  when you need them to make a bad decision  whoa jesus christ  what the hell do you think youre doing  im going to the bank like we said  with the fbi watching you  fbi what are you talking about  right there look  fbi how  i dont know you tell me quentin  greg

money  fine  but you make sure the feds follow you  cause if they follow me  youll wish i put a bullet in your head right here  truth is identity theft isnt hard  a number and an id is all you need to drain a bank account  and return a lot of money to some very surprised retirees  but why stop there  as long as youre stealing someones identity  why not use it to contact some known terrorist organizations  on unsecure phone lines  why not use it to threaten some federal judges  and insult the local drug cartel  most fun ive had in miami  i looked at my bank statement and there it was  all the money  im glad it could work out  i told you didnt i tell you  how did you do it how did you get it all back  you dont want to know  no really you dont want to know  oh well how much do i owe you
