                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until    we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted     when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit nojob history   youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way   you rely on anyone whos still talking to you     a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fb i  you know spies bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  hey is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere   there arent many rules in the spy trade  there are a few agreementsthat most intelligence agencies honor though  lowlevel agents get traded not prosecuted  you dont shoot foreign operatives if you can avoid it  and you stay away from embassies and consulates   mike look you know im up for just about anything  but this this is like cursing in church  i mean technically this is foreign soil  no technically its just trespassing  one perk of being burned my crimes are just crimes not acts of war  but does it have to be the pakistani consulate  couldnt it be i dont know jamaica those guys are probably very easygoing  and theyre not gonna know anything about carla  look shes just an employee mikey  some agent they sent to boss you around   its not like she burned you personally  you dont know that  shes all i got look if she worked in kurdistan  the pakistanis might have a file on her  i dont know i mean the prints she left on veronicas camera  did not come up in any government system  and my buddies checked around like you wanted they didnt come up with anything  thats why im making a new friend look i gotta believe  that the best intelligence outfit in the region  took a few notes when she took off her burka and started wreaking havoc  look if you dont wanna help i can ask fiona  no no its fine fine you guys need your space  now that shes not your girlfriend anymore i guess its probably weird  she was never my girlfriend sam   okay mike   consulates are a great place  to renew your visa pay your taxes back home  or find foreign spies working under diplomatic cover    hey hey back of the line right here pal  excuse me    oh  rich franklin miami herald  they called to say i was coming of course they didnt  i need a couple of visas im doing a piece on foreign trade  i need visas for my editor one for me i need it pronto im sorry i need it right now   like all bureaucrats consulate

consulate  arejust municipal drones enjoying an overseas post     but the head of security  that guys almost always a spy   this is baloney come on like today would be  sir sorry excuse me sir   whats your problem  you need to lower your volume first   this is my regular speaking voice  this is not your regular voice   this is my regular speaking volume sir  no sir it is not   dont patronize me sir  okay lets start over  hello how are you   you are shouting it is not proper for this place  but youre shouting back   this is a volume for a cattle market or vegetable cart  please take a look   sign that and this guy is out  do not tell me what to do who are you   onejob of a security chief is babysitting the secrets  if one goes missing its a big deal  even if its just transactional data on chemical imports  steal a few files no matter how boring and youve got leverage   sir  yes   i would like to invite you to lower your voice   okay hows that   is that better  youre mocking me   i am mocking you   play your cards right  and you can trade what youve got for what you want   in any covert operation  your first concern is remaining undetected      sevencard stud   pam     whether youre infiltrating a military base  or getting car parts from your moms garage without her knowing  staying invisible is tough  and no matter how good you are  michael there you are  i thought you couldnt make it come on in  sometimes theyre better    okay     fi hows it going  down to the felt full boat phyllis here  didnt tell me she used to deal hold em in reno     your girlfriends getting creamed  shes not my girlfriend   okay honey whatever you say  yeah thing is  what  yeah were not uh well were still working together  but the other part thats uh  well weve closed the door on that    why do you always do this  i didnt do it this time she did   right  lets play poker  i mean exactly i mean how does the boy  even find a loan shark in the first place   the yellow pages  sure that works  andys in deep trouble with that man  if he doesnt come up with the money theyre gonna hurt him again  oh its just awful dianes been through so much  you know michael sometimes helps people with problems like this   we both do  really   fi what was that  what was what  michael helps people with problems like this sometimes   well you do  the guy borrowed money from a loan shark  yeah a dumb thing to do but he made the deal he owes the money  and we have no business getting involved with that  he borrowed the money to invest in his moms retirement  stupid yes and sweet and now shes gonna lose the house  what is this about fi you really care that much about some lady you never met  living out in boca raton with a bunch of cats   you owe me  i gave you the car  you owe me more than that  i wanna do this because this guy andy  chose to put somebody he loved before himself  thats why  lets go   hello    phyllis said you were handsome   come in  and single too can you believe it  yeah lets talk about your problem  uh i hear your sons having trouble with a loan shark   andys a good boy a kind boy    its just hes a lot like his father was  he just doesnt always think   how much did he borrow diane  200000  and the man said that if he doesnt return the money  well he cant return it he doesnt have it     uh he a gambler  no god no hes a cell phone salesman  he invested it it was sweet really  i mean the cancer didnt get me but the medical bills might  so he was just trying to to make money so he could take care of me   whats going on here ma  look i have 200 left in savings  please you can have it you can have all of it  just please make sure he doesnt hurt my boy anymore  no absolutely not we talked about this this is my problem  well its not just your problem now is it   who are you  were people who can help   people       i dont think theres anything we can do   he says i gotta pay him but i cant  loan sharks are businessmen  well strike a deal with him set up a payment plan   how much money can you still get your hands on  uh none of it  i put it in this club and its gone   all of it  it was a highrisk highreward type deal  little illegal  oh  thats why the money all had to be cash  lets start from the beginning   okay but uh can we talk about it outside  yes  a few months ago i started going to velvet this club on south beach   and i got to know the owner zeke  zeke  hes a really good guy he cut me in on the club uh partnership  i put up five grand  dude im telling you i saw dividends right away  zeke would pull these fat wads of cash out of the safe right in the back   i mean like   fat wads got it  yeah so anyway one day zeke comes to me  says he can get me in on this new place hes gonna open   thing is the club is in cuba  hence the cashonly thing  shady i know but zeke says were looking at like 1000 return on investment   so you went in   yeah  i had to get the cash together my moms got bills  anyway so i go one day to deliver the cash to zekes house  and im telling you the minute i put the cash on the table  the fbi swarms the place  can i tell the rest of the story just to save time  the feds rush in arrest zeke but not before rushing you out the back  zekes under indictment but hes promising not to turn you in   feds take the cash but  at least you got your freedom   how did you  andy you were conned   but the feds  they werent feds they were actors its a classic kissoff  zekes a con man    im such an idiot  look on the bright side you might get to keep your kneecaps  do you think you think zekell give me the money back when he finds out im onto him  no but there are other ways we can get your money back    ooh look at her  and her i bet shed be fun  are you shopping for me or for you  you are gonna have to get back out there sooner or later  no what i have to do is get back there  now andy said zekes office is just past the vip room  good bet he keeps the cash there probably launders the money through the club  hey fi the cash the safe  i dont understand why you refuse to mix business with pleasure  can we focus our ticket to the back room just showed up  youre no fun michael  now zeke on the other hand looks like he knows how to have a good time   exploiting an asset is easier when they have a vice  an addiction you can feed  drugs money respect women  breaking into the safe shouldnt be too hard  getting invited into the back  shouldnt be too difficult either  why dont you go meet your pakistani spy and ill take care of this  yeah uh just dont just  just just dont work too hard  ah i will be wearing a white shirt and    this word right here is a kind of uh spicy goat cheese  i was trying to say black pants my urdus a little rusty  at least you got the name of the restaurant right   im waseem alihan and you are  just a friend who needs a favor  mmm  well i need a favor too i would like those documents returned  so what can i do for you  so direct its refreshing  im looking for a spy a woman who worked in kurdistan about 15 years ago  i dont have her real name but shes very distinctive very attractive very forceful  im sure she made a big splash your intel might have some info on her  what you want is worth more than what you have  sorry wish i could help  come on waseem pick up the phone call back home  to land a gig like this in miami you gotta be pretty well connected  i am and id like to stay that way  so go ahead leak those documents  id rather take my chances than ask for an eyesonly dossier on a foreign operative  now uh how are the peach mojitos here hmm   go head girl shake that thing    just move that thing    if you need to get into a secure area  the best approach is to give yourself a good reason to be there   now its just us  why sneak past guards when you can just spill a martini   oh oh   oh bloody hell  im sorry   wheres your loo  uh out the front around the bar  oh you want me to go out there looking like this  no no of course not use mine   oh   a hairpin is one of the most versatile tools in a thiefs arsenal  its as good as a key most of the time  but not when the lock is a magnetic card reader      zeke is one careful con man  hes security conscious hes smart  and smooth too in a cheesy sam kind of way   hey smooth is smooth baby  the club is locked down tight  we wanna get to the safe we need zekes key card and he keeps it on him all the time   cant you lift it sticky fingers  yes i can  but i already made my play hell get suspicious if i duck into the back again   so it looks like a twoman job now  yeah  trouble is zeke only lets girls and marks past security  yeah so one of us has to play the fool  i know who id vote for  see you tonight youre perfect for it michael  hey hows that thing going with your new pakistani pal   hes a good guy he likes miami there might be an angle there     diane  theyre here on the porch   andy get away from the door  sit tight were coming   andy get away from the door  sit tight were coming   how about if i handle the lookout  and you deal with whatever is going on inside   mmm that seems fair  yeah hes uh  hes an old guy a little frail but hes probably armed though       stop please we dont have anything  im terribly sorry but your son hes very late with my money  guys guys wifebeaters so not a good look   whos this who are you  im a friend  now we can come to some kind of an arrangement youre a businessman right  i am this man owes me 200   with the vig 230  and youre gonna have it look at this   the key to handtohand combat  is being able to close the distance between you and your opponent  without putting them on their guard  these are nice people this is not necessary we dont have to do this  i mean guys come on   impressive  we dont want any trouble  okay but now its on you too  two days  if i have my money therell be no more trouble  if i dont youll need a lot more than a magazine   two days  ow  how can we get that money in two days keep it on   were gonna hit the club tonight  you know how to crack safes  some but i cant crack just any safe i need some details  andy do you think you would recognize zekes safe if you saw it again  i think so but how are you going to get to the safe  zekes got these two huge guys guarding the vip he only takes women back there  andy you got back there  oh sure but i was an investor  andy youre looking at zekes new mark   oh     oh  whats up waseem  how unexpected trina meet my friend uh  mr inconsiderate i shouldve brought a fruit salad  so waseem have you given any more thought to what we talked about  im sorry but no  so you really dont want your documents back   i wouldnt say that id say the price is too high  really  too high i could get six figures from any number of buyers  and theyll all have a bone to pick with pakistan   youre sure youre not interested  whats bad for pakistan  and whats bad for waseem  they arent necessarily the same thing  mmm i know what you mean  youre a tough one waseem you win   take your documents back    honey hes a keeper i wouldnt let go of him  all this stuff belongs to fiona was she a locksmith  no just a hobby of hers   you sure thats the safe  yeah i remember that dial  so once youre into zekes office what you just drill through the lock     its not a highend safe  i just knock the lock off with a hammer  the real problem will be carrying the cash out of the club  right cash is heavy  i brought mine to zeke in an overnight bag you wanna borrow my duffel  no theyre gonna carry the cash out for us themselves  im gonna stuff it into a trash bag give it to the busboys  and they bring it out to the dumpster  listen uh i brought you something from the store  i wish i could pay you but its all i got  think you can use a bunch of cell phones  yeah i can find a use for em      michael   no andy andy andy no  andy andy dont   hi you must be andy  yeah   oh im michaels mom  oh hey   hey  your sons been helping me out   aw  i

that way michael i want you to talk to me  i dont wanna talk about it   fine  fine  you dont wanna talk about it  ill talk to fiona      great      so he goes on up to the hill  and he says which one

slow  offer them limited partnerships in velvet see how it goes  but with you i can see youre like me a player  im not gonna waste your time in the shallow end  dont then say somethin son   im opening a new club in havana  havana   last time i checked that was in cuba  we deal only in cash  no legal hiccups that way its gonna be huge the upside is enormous   yeah how much you puttin in  me plenty  i mean no cash but sweat equity  believe me the cash ah thats the easy part   why dont you boys stop playing with each other  oh  mmm  and play with me instead  this whiskey is runnin right through me   wheres the head  uh that way  whoo    there are two schools of safecracking    some people like to beat the lock some people like to break the lock  but it doesnt matter when the safe is sitting wide open  good counterfeit money is more expensive than you think  if youre looking to fake money on the cheap   a real bill bound to a stack of filler will do    time to collect the trash  this safe is nothing but a prop to impress marks  theres nothing in here but a few hundreds and some newspapers   so wheres the real safe  no time to look  i dont want any more surprises im putting ears on this guy  put your phone on mute and plug it in  oh mike youre tying up my cell well   hows veronica supposed to get a hold of me  tell her to try the bar at carlitos          yeah fi  michael you got a problem  it looks like zekes got partners  i think you need to hurry it up   thirty years ago the cia wouldve killed  for bugs as small as cell phones  theyre the perfect improvised listening device  but they burn juice like a humvee  if theres no charger handy an unused usb port will do the trick   michael its really time to go your covers about to be blown   almost done     sam you there  yeah yeah    hey hey you wanna talk some business  maybe a little later i think its time for me and this little lady   to get to know each other better  whoo   hoo hoo you dont mind do you partner  there was nothing in the safe  newspaper fat wads of it  man we got one day  i got baranski calling me for his money and now youre telling me  settle down see michael doesnt look worried  sharp lady your ma remember zekes partners  the guys who played the feds that stung you  listen to what zeke was telling em last night   im telling you this davis cat is bigtime and hes hungry   well what kind of timetable you looking at    how soon can you rent that house    see he wants to score so its just a matter of convincing him that the only way  hes gonna see our money is if he shows us his first  and when he does  theyre going to con him trick him into giving them the money  oh okay cool  cool    zeke this is chuck the painintheass wet nurse thats watching my money   charles finley sole executor of mr cullens trust  im runnin a quart low im gonna get back here and serve myself  sir do you have any idea who youre getting into bed with here  davis cullen can be difficult  i mean there have been a few incidents   i think ill take my chances  dont say i didnt warn you  fair enough now what were talking about is 200 grand  hmm not insubstantial whats your commitment  well as i explained to mr cullen i dont invest financially  however my time my expertise   oh i see   to win a negotiation  you have to show youre willing to walk away   i dont share in the same kind of profits either of course  hmm  by getting in on the ground floor of our club in havana mr cullen can expect   im sorry sir did you say havana  yes     and the best way to show youre willing to walk away  is to walk away     whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa where you going  sir it is my fiduciary duty to protect mr cullens estate  not a penny moves without my signoff not a penny  and i cant very well sign off on anything in cuba good day   i dont think we have a deal  son of a bitch  oh well see about this    for the hostess i figured im gonna need to get you girls back in the bag   if im gonna hold my own at poker today    um yeah about that   am i early  no no no ll  i asked the girls if theyd come an hour later  um  i wanted some time to talk to you alone  please   well whats on your mind  this breakup  the two of you are making a huge mistake  if you dont mind my saying   madeline it  no please  listen  i need you to know  you are the best thing that ever happened to michael  hes different when youre around hes better  hes almost happy  thank you for saying that its more than hes ever said himself  i know his father was the same way  but i see the way he looks at you fiona  ill always  ill always care about your son madeline  you know l i just cant be the second  most important thing in his life  i cant blame you for that honey    mmm  mmm oh  ooh oh hurry back  a pakistani spy eating in an indian restaurant  my friend you have gone native  well i like the chicken tikka   what do you want  same as ever i just want that file  kind oflooks like youre taking a bribe doesnt it  maybe but its flimsy  i dont know youre taking a kickback there  youre accepting a free lunch right now this is on me by the way   raji  hey hello   i havent done anything wrong  thats right  and you could explain all of this to your boss back home probably even keep your job  but your time in miami would be over  youve been made approached possibly compromised  youd be relocated to a different consulate where do you think theyd send you  libya honduras hows serbia these days   and i thought you wanted to be friends  we can still be friends  all i want is a 10yearold file remember  but if you really think leaving the beaches  the blondes and the brunettes is worth it  its your call waseem  despite my strenuous objections  mr cullen has impressed upon me his desire to move forward  well im glad to see that cooler heads have prevailed  i have two conditions as executor of mr cullens trust  i still have to protect myself legally  so im afraid that neither of these are negotiable  first i need to see some paperwork and none of it had better mention cuba  well shouldnt be much of a problem to dummy up some paperwork  wonderful secondly and this is vital  we need to know that you are as financially committed as mr cullen  ooh as i explained before  i will hold mr cullens 200000 offshore in a joint escrow account  if you would like to see this deal go through  you will have to put matching funds into the same account  yeah well i never put up my own money  awkward  mr cullen im very sorry   i tried twice  youve seen that but uh im sorry  i cannot allow you to be involved in this    fine  lets do this  very well ready your funds  well make the transfers tomorrow    i only need the money for one day   no no way  this is stupid i got a whale here dont you see that  you need to watch yourself zeke yourejust a face  you dont like how we do it you can go back to tending bar  if you can get him out to the house so we can give him the brushoff fine  otherwise cut him loose  sounds like zekes partners have veto power   so he cant put up any money we need to deal with baranski     ive got five hours  im gonna get us some more time  hello how are we this evening  oh were good were gonna get you the money we just need a little more time  that is acceptable  i can wait  but there is someone here who does not share my patience  tell andy his mother is very disappointed with him   listen to me very carefully you do not wanna hurt that woman  youre right i dont but shes going to stay right here with me till i have every penny    andy listen to me baranskis not gonna hurt your mom  are you sure how can you be sure  hes just trying to prove a point  that he can get to us at any time  that he really wants his money  well i really wanna give it to him but i cant  andy you have to just trust us  you want me to make 200 grand just poof appear in a numbered account  michael im good but i cant just will that kind of money into existence  no ones saying it has to exist  come on youve never written a bad check  you were called bad check barry  i know  i guess i could wire the money from an account that happens to be closed  of course you can i have faith in you barry  but im gonna have to bounce the money through a few time zones to keep my fingerprints off it   its a couple days to set it up  how does a couple hours sound  ah that sounds like michael westen  theres just one thing  youre not gonna have long before some branch manager in zurich catches wind  one panicked phone call to aruba your moneys gone  how much time before my money disappears   five minutes maybe  can you give me 10   um for anyone else michael itd be three    zeke its davis im in  hey i was beginning to think that finley guy called all the shots  yeah i dont see chuck figuring much into my
