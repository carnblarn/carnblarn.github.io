stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way   you rely on anyone whos still talking to you     a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fb i  you know spies bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  hey is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help

wanna know who did this to me   you think i burned you  i know you did  youre on the edge of something much much bigger than us my friend  people i work for they have plans for you  nate i need you to pick me up  fi and sam are on a job dealing with some heroin dealers     out of the car   they took sam  yeah thats pretty painful  how was that for you   uh mike its for you  yello   come out come

hours  if you even come near me before that i will put a bullet in my head   i believe we have a deal   at least this time we get to say goodbye  thank you fi   time to get some questions answered  burn notice huh   we need to talk michael weve been trying to bring you in  were so looking forward to meeting you   as a spy you get to spend a lot of time alone    whether youre in an indonesian prison  a cave in the afghan mountains or the back of a cargo truck it comes with thejob  youre trained to make the most of it plan your next move  go over your intel review your training  but when youve cleaned your gun 30 times  and reviewed the past tense of every verb in five languages   you start itching to make a move                 hit right there     check it out               hello   hello michael  sounds like youre having quite a party out there  indeed we are and youre the guest of honor  no need for that michael the shootings all over  i hope youre not too disappointed  you can see me oh i wish i could see you i thought we were gonna meet   we will first some business  yeah sweetie i thought we were gonna discuss why you burned me  weve had our eye on you for a while michael   im sorry i didnt catch your name  no you didnt  why dont you call me carla  go over to the car   we have something we want you to take care of for us  ajob    dont call it a job call it a favor    i assume it has to do with the guy youve got giftwrapped and ducttaped  his name is jimmy hes someone else we asked for a favor  you see he decided to skip town instead   oh so this is your employee retention program  you could call it that  he needs to go back to miami and do as hes told you need to help him   i do and whys that  we have his wife and daughter  if you dont help what happens to them    oh and one more thing  jimmy called 911 when he saw our team     you probably wanna move along  i do this and then we meet  i keep my promises   ill see what i can do     dont move       air bags are great for surviving crashes  but they make some evasive maneuvers tough  gone are the days when you could run through a stand of trees without a face full of nylon  of course anything you used to do headon you can still do  but its a little hard on anyone whos stuffed in your trunk     security measures can sometimes seem a little cruel  just like parents sometimes twist their kids arm  yanking them out of a busy street  sometimes the safest thing isnt the most comfortable  sorry about the trunk but i had to keep you out of sight  for a few counties until we got clear of the police  jimmy what are you doing  we dont have time for this im here to help you  now the people who did this are putting the screws to me too  i dont wanna be here any more than you do now do you want your family back  im gonna work on that can you be good  we have a long drive back to miami if you can be good you get to ride up front  lets rock          a couple months ago i got a call from this lady   smoky voice lots of attitude   wait a minute you know her  not as well as id like  anyway she wanted me to break into this place where i did a job  ajob what is it you do jimmy  hey look imim im in computer systems okay  li did a a gig about a year ago for this company called security associates  security associates is that private military  yeah sure something like that i dont know okay  they were corporate guys uh but but really scary  and the lady on the phone she told me to break into there okay  and get a memory dump off their hard drive and get it back to her   what did you say  i said she was freaking insane im a computer tech man  im im not im not a breakin guy   so i was like no way  and this led to you being hogtied on an airstrip  the lady on the phone threatened my family so we decided to bail  we hired this guy with a private plane and then we went upstate  and we were about to leave and these guys with guns  they came out of this helicopter and then they just  they took my wife and my kid  please i dont even know who you are but  you gotta help me  well figure something out  ho whoa mike easy  just me and a couple of slices of wonder bread  hey you okay i gotta say i didnt expect you back  yeah i didnt expect to be back either  making yourself comfortable i see  uh comfortable i wouldnt go that far  mike how do you fit into these little shirts theyre like doll clothes  anyway after you got me out of the boat i didnt wanna scare veronica you know  with all this so i thought id  lay low at your place for a while  wait a minute what happened with the big meeting  it didnt go as well as id hoped  seems the people that burned me want me for a job for now thats all i got   ajob does it pay  more of a   well kill you if you dont do it type of thing  ah  never liked those   so what is it  help some computer tech steal some data  i figure if i find out what they want stolen i might get an idea of who they are  the uh the guys outside in the uh in the caddy  the caddy you brought back the caddy  oh mike thats great i was afraid to ask you know cause veronica  she was getting on my case and l  yeah about that its gonna need a little work   so were safe here  uh safe would be a stretch  but lets just say we could do worse  okay i need my phone cause i have to call  uh no jimmy you dont need your phone  you called 911 on a double homicide the police are now tracking it  you just need to go on in and clean yourself up  go ahead   hey fi    i cant believe you michael  fortyeight hours ago we said goodbye possibly forever  and then i get a message from you on my cell  that i should come right over because you got a job  fi theres a lot going on so  you couldnt start with im alive   i thought the fact that i was calling covered that  thats not the point  fi fi   i called you because i need your help    ah sorry hold on  hold on hold on hello  yeah mom im fine i told you not to make calls on that phone  well i know that but im stuck in a motel in fort lauderdale  and ive been worried sick  if the phones being bugged by those spy people i guess now they know it too  im worried about my son  besides calls from a motel phone cost a dollar  oh thats terrible  so when can i start making calls again  just come on home you can make all the calls you want  what about those men with the guns   are you okay  yeah more or less   im so glad  im glad too mom   bye michael    you hadnt called your mom yet  i was going to wait a bit  thanks for coming fi     so this woman on the phone  did you ever see her in person   did she give you a name anything  no i told you i never met her  i mean she said her name was carla that was it  besides that it was just you know go steal the stuff for us or else  okay so what is this data whats on these computers that they want so badly  i dont know they dont pay me to look at the files  they pay me to keep people from stealing them why do they even need us  i mean if theyre blowing up a plane theyve got guys  the people behind this they dont wanna get their hands dirty  so they get others to do their work for them  like making us break into security associates  i checked that place out guy who runs it is ryder stahl  guys been to all the hot spots usually has corporate clients who want some heavy firepower  basically anyplace where more guns  equal more money mikey  yeah thats the guy yeah   im gonna need you to make an introduction  talk to ryder  face to face no no no no no no no  private security companies dont have a lot of walkin business jimmy  so were gonna need an introduction and youre the best weve got  if im gonna do this i need to look at their security setup  itll be fine sam and fi will back us up if anything goes wrong right  uh yeah right right we got you covered absolutely no problem   yeah  yeah  okay    calm down youll be fine  right can we just go over it one more time  sure we go in you introduce me you leave   private military companies  are best known for their bodyguard work  its a big part of their business but its not the only part  for a big enough check theyll rain hot lead down wherever you want  its not work that attracts service with a smiletypes  jimmy  hi thanks for um this is the guy that i told you about   you wanted to talk to me   terry miller  heard a lot of great things about your operation  ryder stahl jimmy here tells me youre in mining  my boyjimmy here he says that youre the folks to look for when we need a mercenary  were security consultants not mercenaries  right li think what he meant was  oi i can speak for myself mate piss off then we got business  okay  you call yourself what you like  i got serious business to be handled  now can we go upstairs and talk in private  ive got mining interests up round the northern border of kenya  locals are my problem i need em dealt with  dealt with what does that mean  you know what it means enough with the word games  im willing to pay good money for a permanent solution to my problem  mr miller you just solicited an illegal act  and my security tells me youve got a backup team  sitting on the roof of the parking garage across the street  are you a cop   is this a joke  no joke  twoperson team watching we do regular security sweeps  i dont know who these blokes are but theyre not backup  ive got an operation that looks to prove out in the low nine figures   i got enemies mate  so theyre not yours   not mine  i guess well just have to find out  take him out the back  youre being too hard on mike you know he damn near got himselfkilled saving me  yeah and i damn near got myself killed saving the both of you  and then he comes back and acts like nothing happened  im just saying i can count on one hand the number of buddies i got  who would stage an armed assault to save my butt okay  you got mike you got   when youre claiming to be someone youre not  the key is commitment  youve got to sell it like your life depends on it  because sometimes it does  the point is mike is the kind of guy whos got your back   gun   one reason to work  with the same people is you know each others moves  so if you shoot at your team in the middle of an operation they know to go with it  what the hell is he doing  i think we just got recruited into michaels cover id  get down get down   it takes a good marksman to shoot you at 50 feet from a moving car  but it takes a great marksman to miss  while making it look like theyre trying to hit you  or markswoman as the case may be  so youre saying that that went well  he doesnt think im a cop anymore  its true i got him backstopped with a job history bank accounts  even got a british mining company to hire him as a contractor retroactively  point is ryders boys have been calling around checking him out  now we just go back to him sell him on the deal and check out his security layout  listen even if we pull this thing off  im the only guy that can get that data and they know that okay  if we do this im a dead man   never let that happen jimmy one problem at a time  thats easy for you to say  yo jimbo   what  come on  lets go upstairs set you up with a beer maybe a yogurt  got this great card game we used to play back on the seal teams when we were feeling crappy     ill teach you youre gonna love it     yeah ma youre back in town  michael you have to come over here now   its a disaster  on my way   ma    what are you doing put the shotgun down  well what am i supposed to do there are men in suits with guns out there after me   theyre after me  well youre here so maybe i should have a shotgun  whats the disaster  its the coffeemaker  you had me rush out of here at such short notice the damn thing burned out  it blew a fuse in the kitchen and spoiled a fridge full of food  this is the disaster  a coffeemaker built in 1967  and the food ive been cleaning for hours  oh i found your phone in the glove compartment of the charger  my phone in the charger  well i assumed it was one of yours  you go through those things like toothpicks  cars in the garage   excuse me a sec mom       hello there michael good to hear from you  glad i could brighten your day  looks like you owe my mom a new coffeemaker  care to tell me why youre breaking into her house  just letting you know we can  id like to remind you that theres a clock on this operation of ours  i want you to speak to someone   daddy  no its not your daddy im a friend of your dads  can i talk to him  hes not here right now but he wants me to tell you that he misses you  i dont like it here when is he coming  can you tell me where you are   no she cant  leave her alone youre not really gonna hurt a little girl  maybe maybe not  if i get what i want you dont need to find out    they said you werent in so i waited   you got a lot of balls coming here  it seems to me  if anyone should be upset mate its me  im the one who got shot at im the one who needs a job done  if youre not interested i leave miami  if you are interested we talk now  come on lets try it again   every thiefknows  that the best way to scout a place you wanna rob is as a customer  who gets to see the vault at the local bank  the rich guy with something to protect  who gets to see the security at a private military company  a guy who wants to start his own little war  theres unoxidized kimberlite in this region here  its called blue ground  it means diamonds   my problem is the village  we can handle the problem area  you eliminate the civilians and burn it youd never know it was there  lets get to the details on the deal  not so fast mate theres a hundred mil us  people kill for this deal not just those people from the other day  i need to know my information is secure  building security is 247  we have biometric security in all the key areas  key card access throughout the building   a great way to get people talking about their security  is to put them on the defensive  accuse a guy ofhaving bad locks and before you know it  hes telling you where his motion detectors are  right thats a nice toy but what about this door  hollow core veneer you can cut through that with a handsaw  that may be but what do you do then the doors alarmed  building security is here in under a minute police under five       and here  the computer is kept in a sealed room with a burn vault  someone breaks in melts the drives to slag   it takes some practice  but counting your steps can be extremely useful  if you need to reproduce a floor plan from memory  not bad could be better  ill come back tuesday well talk terms   once youve memorized a floor plan  you want to get it down on paper as quickly as you can  combine that with the technical specs of the security devices in the room  and youll know where the holes in the security are  then its just a matter of slipping through one of those holes    that is a terrible two  right   so lets do the math how many twos in a deck  four  right so those are your cards you can play twos or fours   or two plus four is what  six    six  six you can play an eight two times four is what   eight  eight you can play a four an eight a two  sam  uh i appreciate you trying to distract him but could you take it outside  sure come on jimbo  lets go out on the balcony get some fresh air so you can concentrate  figuring out a time when we can have our conversation  fi im planning a heist um  can can you just i mean l i gotta do the job  first right   so what can i do for the job  i need you to get us into iso gene labs  its a dna testing facility one floor above security associates  i need to get in there for an hour at night alone  and were gonna be making a lot of noise  you have a high estimation of my skills michael  youve earned every bit of it fi    so once im in how do i get the data  its complicated you have to um br   i have to come with you  jimmy  uh i dont think this is your kind of operation  i know none of this is  but those computers and hard drives are completely secure okay  and i made them that way  to steal the data we have to tap into the hard wiring in the wall   well only have one chance to do that  its gonna be dangerous  doesnt matter  this is for my wife and my daughter  get me in and ill get the data  hold on a sec   whats the matter    oh bum knee i gotta you know stretch it once   oh oh     badly done surveillance  that is surveillance you notice  can mean a lot of things  some organizations need intelligence but cant afford to pay for training  hey oh   okay okay   some organizations just want you to know theyre watching   who are you who sent you  i dont know  i answered an ad a hundred bucks to watch and take notes   some woman  she give you anything  yeah she told me not to open this  i was wondering when youd call oh that was some operative you sent  a freelancer  i dont think hell be answering newspaper ads for a while  jimmy got our message  we thought you could use a little reminder of whats at stake here  yeah we head in tonight is that soon enough   thats fine thank you  now i need something from you   what is that  the guns your guys used to kill those men at the airstrip   you have em  they could probably be located whatever for  i want em if im gonna work for you i want tactical support  i confess im curious fine youll have your guns  and jimmys family i will give you a date and location   you will deliver them when and where i say  of course michael   we want this to be a good experience for everyone     i am so sorry  we called as soon as we realized the problem  apparently the engineer missed the defect in the architectural plans  were dealing with all the floors  wed start with security associates below you  but youre up first cause youve got all the heavy equipment  well lucky us im just glad you guys caught it before someone fell through the floor   getting into a secure facility  is as simple as giving yourself a good reason to be there   here we are  uh yeah  oh its so stiff  ill pull it out  right here right here  our guys will need a few hours the defects in the beam so theyll be cutting  we just need you to notify the building and let the workers in  next morning itll be like we were never here and ill be out of your hair  hey you come back anytime you like  theyll be by tonight please dont forget to call building security  or i will get into so much trouble  we cant have that ill call now     talk to our rep  she told me you were coming yes  how about her huh were gonna be in the back lab over here  were gonna be making some noise it should only take a couple of hours  theres some bs about the chemicals we use  you can come back but its gotta be on your insurance  im uh  im fine here thanks   the typical floor is concrete slab  over 20gauge steel pan  with steel trusses spaced 30 inches for support  when you cut through a floor  the thing you have to worry about is wiring  cut into the wrong wire and youll set off the building alarms  electrocute yourself or both  if you dont want a chunk of concrete crashing through to the floor below  you need to drill a hole and anchor the slab   come on    okay were comin comin   were comin were comin   a concrete saw cuts it like butter   yeah      okay    if youve done your planning right youll be  dropping into a blind spot for the security system  usually behind an interior wall  motion detectors bounce sound off objects and analyze the reflection  if something changes the alarm goes off  move slow enough  and a wool comforter absorbs enough sound to keep it from triggering  a thermal blanket meanwhile shields your body from heat sensors   how do you think hes doing in there  its michael  so look uh fi  i gotta go back to veronica  explain where ive been  why im all beat to hell and what happened to the caddy   id pay to watch that  oh come on fi youre a girl   what do i say  im your girl consultant now  when did i sign up for that job  okay fine forget it you know i got lots of other friends with ovaries  i got you  tell her you got beaten up defending a helpless man  from a gang of exlowlife soldiers   its true enough  okay   so im the hero  and the helpless man   aha   ill leave it here   somebodys working late better let mike know     evening mr stahl  hey stevie thanks for the call   whats goin on  its uh probably nothing but you said you wanted us  to call you anytime if something unusual was going on in the building   how long  i dont know its supposed to be backing up now  the data runs along the cable to the backup drives  well whats the problem we dont have time  i know i set the backup for 1130 im not wait wait wait wait okay  its coming its coming its coming its coming its coming yes yes yes  yes yes yes oh god   oh god     thats not good  give him a minute   oh god im so sorry what uh what do we do  plan b     she says theres nothing inside me   she says theres    quadrangle buckshot is a specialized round  designed to destroy the inside of anything delicate  a computer for example  get back  take the rope and tie it off  were going out the window  unless you wanna wait around   for hardened security glass  i prefer frag12 a military round with an explosive projectile  go         oh   oh ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow    ow okay  oh i think i sprained my body  hey you want another beer im telling you did wonders for my ribs   youre fine  i just want my family back   were working on it  yeah how  those guys at security associates theyre gonna kill me as soon as they get a chance  exactly and that makes them predictable and thats how were gonna solve your problem  sam can you get me a boat something disposable  disposable oh i see where youre going  i know a guy yeah its a decent boat once upon a time  its got mold but doesnt sound like its gonna be around long enough to bother us  how is this gonna solve my problem  these guys from security associates want to kill you  we need to give them the opportunity to do just that  trust me the heat thats on you everyone thinking that youre dead   its gonna be the best thing that ever happened to you     yeah fi  michael  i got a delivery today  someone was kind enough to break into the trunk of my car   yeah what was it  a present from your friends  be careful with those fi theyre very hot  oh ill take good care ofem  michael your mother

windows in south beach   jimmy  huh   call ryder  are you sure   youyou said the cops would be listening on this phone so  thats thats the point  we talked about this and we practiced it so you could do that now   okay     security associates   uh i need to speak to ryder tell tell him that its jimmy  hold please   you did a hell of a job on my office kid  you really think youre gonna get away

just meet then i can explain everything  i dont need explanations jimmy i need my data back   l i wanna give it back to you  thats good  just tell me where you are   once the cops pick up a call on a flagged cell  they triangulate its location  from there they organize and deploy units   a process that can take 10 minutes give or take  go  bad guys dont have that chain of command  they can be anywhere as fast as their wheels can take them  get in position stay out of sight   im going down to the boat  what do we do if he comes out you want us to pop him  no i need to figure what the hell
