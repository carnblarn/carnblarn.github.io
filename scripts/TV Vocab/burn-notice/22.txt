                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn noticeon you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend   should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi   you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too   hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line  until you figure out who burned you youre not going anywhere  previously on burn notice  the people who burned me got a specialized rifle for a sniper  got him an access card for this building  and sent him to the conference room on the fourth floor  yeah but we dont know what he was doing in there  hes scouting a perch sam  i think i found his target  if you want to get in her room now would be the time  find anything  we hit the jackpot  well theres some familiar faces in here  i think were getting close mikey  there are things in the works that are far far over your head  stay out of them or there will be consequences  there are cops here and theyre arresting your brother  its as setup  shes gonna have her sniper take his target out now  if i can get home and get that access card  i can get to the sniper before he takes his shot  yeah i got some news mikey the snipers dead  someone boobytrapped his front door mike  when youre a spy you learn to live with the idea of people wanting you dead  an old enemy a dissatisfied employer a disgruntled asset  work long enough and the line to kill you gets pretty long  still getting blown up isnt really something you get used to   what  dont try it dont try that  you just took a pretty bad fall  uh make that a very bad fall  come here buddy easy  i think your car saved your life mike  not the first time  youve been out for about 20 minutes  i got here as soon as i could  watch your head  either someones very interested in waterfront storage containers  or theyre here to pay you a visit  get your seat belt on mikey  sam  brace yourself mikey  oh mike steady you okay  im fine  sam im sorry about the car  yeah its just i i put a lot of love into it  well its pretty identifiable now  yeah i know i just need a sec to grieve here  all right look you think we should be out here   i mean maybe we should get you to a hospital   we got to keep moving  when youre being hunted paranoia is inevitable  if you dont know what to do with it it turns into cold directionless fear  with the right training it turns into hyperawareness of your surroundings  not always pleasant but a lot more useful  you seem a little unsteady  yeah im fine im fine  so mike who do you think was in those cars  probably carlas guys  whatevers going on my guess is  she needs to talk to me   she had nate arrested  what are you serious  i got a call from my mom right before i talked to you  hold on  distinguishing between different kinds of suspicious behavior   is crucial for an operative  surveillance  not surveillance sam  someone doing surveillance for example looks different  than someone whos trying to commit suicide  burn notice  season 02 episode 10  do no harm  lets just start with your name whats your name   its kenny  kenny  you want to tell me why you were trying to kill yourself  its my son jack okay  he needs the money i was just trying to  jjust forget it okay  uh mike we should keep moving i dont know how much longer  in a sec  listen i really need to go are you gonna be all right  youre not gonna be okay  whats up with him  hes just looking for some friends of mine  who are you i still dont understand  im someone who might be able to help you with your problem  you know you look like youre in pretty bad shape yourself  just tell me about your son jack  hes 6 and hes got a heart problem since he was born  and its getting worse  he uh might not make it  and how does getting hit by a bus help that  theres a treatment center in arizona that looks like it might be able to help him  but i cant afford it  a few months ago i uh  i blew all my money on a scam  a scam  yeah i met a lady in a pharmacy and she told me her kid had the same thing  and he got cured  working until the doctor vanished  and it turned out to be pep pills mixed with a painkiller  it just made jack worse  so i  i left a note for the babysitter and i  i went out to get the money  from the first day of training youre told not to get emotionally involved in operations  but sometimes it happens and theres nothing you can do  give me whatever you have thats connected to the people that did this  i will get you your money back  get my money back seriously how  by any means necessary   this is insane  its done sam  its irresponsible  youre raising this guys hopes not to mention you were almost killed  you got surveillance everywhere your brothers in jail you got plenty going on  and some guywalks in front of a bus and  i didnt make him walk in front of the bus sam  you were looking for this i know you  if it wasnt this guy itd be somebody else walking down the street  im running on fumes sam  this is all i got i can help this guy  all right mike i get it  oh look theres our surveillance car just like i said come on  mike lets go  im not running  oh no oh youre not gonna  oh you are gonna  hi you here to bring me in let me help  you got to unlock the door its on the handle push push there you go jackass   michael  carla new office i like it  what the hell was that today  youre asking me  last time i checked you put my brother in jail you chased me halfway across miami  and you nearly got my head blown off  we had nothing to do with that  nothing your sniper got blown up the same way  by the way howd the assassination go  an operation was compromised  which is why youre holed up in an office with two guys and a bag of cheetos  tell me why am i here  you were told to stay out of our business  well clearly you didnt think i would do what i was told  because you went to a lot of trouble to keep me busy  we need to know what happened if youre playing some kind of a game  i am flattered that you think im that devious  but i didnt blow myself up for your benefit  i want my brother out of jail  i want answers  i want my life back  well be in touch  get him out of here  whatever blew you up was pretty substantial  if youd have opened the door any wider   wed be picking up little ittybitty pieces of you  can you check the chemical traces see what kind of explosives they used  sure  michael i do admire you getting right back to work but you did almost die yesterday  you want to call the guy say sorry about your kid but i got a lot going on right now  find anything in the medical records sam  well i crosschecked the clinics and the pharmacy records  and it looks like our scammers got their lead through a clinic in coral gables  probably have a source there tipping them off  sounds about right  how do you want to play it mike  hows your liver feeling  we dont have any appointments for several weeks  but if you want you could always try calling other clinics  ive been calling ive been to every clinic in town  its liver damage for christs sake how complicated can it be  i understand sir  oh please  maam i am in pain okay  lets get something going here  sir no no no that really wont be necessary  ill see if we can fit you in  okay thank you  man  modernday healthcare  im sorry sir  i couldnt help but overhear  you said youre having liver trouble  yeah damn things falling apart  have you heard ofhepatodyne  its an experimental drug out of europe did wonders for my father  medical scammers like pimps drug dealers of feral dogs need to protect their territory  they cant let anyone new operate there or theyre asking for problems  i actually i have some in my car  sign me up  like a corporation has a lawyer to handle copyright infringement  a scammer will often have an enforcer to deal with unwanted competition  take one to two tablets by mouth every four hours as needed  and heres my number if you have any questions  oh thats very nice thanks a lot   youre welcome  appreciate it  good luck   what do you think youre doing  what who the hell are you   get out of here  this is a public place i have every right  you want a problem  is that a gun ill call the police  and then what you gonna sell them some pills  theres already somebody working this place  whats the problem here   you with her  yeah were sorry  we didnt mean to move in on your score all right  look theres plenty of money to be made in that clinic right  maybe we can work together whats your name  as a spy the best approach is usually to become a targets friend   its todd  yeah im donny good to meet you  im a lefty sorry  some situations though call for a different approach  subtle i like it  empty comercial buildings are useful  when youre looking for a place to interrogate someone  no one pays much attention to people coming and going  and the floors are typically soundproof  used to be some kind of gallery  my buddys the building manager  theyre gonna remodel in a couple of months but for now   we got the whole place to ourselves  this is perfect sam  looks like your pals waking up  just sit tight be with you in a bit  securing a room isnt about walls  a determined captive can kick through plasterboard  but he cant bite through steel bars or pry out screws with his fingers  though it might be fun to watch him try  youre sure about this treatment in arizona  i mean as sure as i can be  you go ahead and make the arrangements  what you got the money back you serious  not yet but i will  listen i appreciate you trying but  i really dont think you know what youre up against  you just call the treatment center you sign jack up and make plane reservations  okay  i just got a lot of stuff to put in order  i need to find some place to put jack  i know someone who can babysit  youre doing a job what about your brother hes sitting in a jail cell michael   im handling it  yeah you almost got yourself killed  im handling it  will you do this favor for me please  hi there sweetheart  what do you say you and i go find some toys for you to play with   would you like that

great little scam going down here  we want in  what do you want a job application  youre good  youre a funny guy todd  job application  no  you know how it is when you get to a new area  you got to do a little research know the competition  the business environment  so  tell me all about your little business starting with your coworkers  get out of my face  i got nothing to say to you  nothing thats disappointing  theres a saying in interrogation violence perceived is violence achieved  you dont want someone screaming  you want him asking questions asking what is he doing with that knife  now why would you want to disappoint me like that  that hurts me  that hurts me like this  asking if hell do that to himself what will he do to me  that is a sharp knife  mostly you want him asking how do i make this stop  what do you want stop  i just want to know about your business  theres nothing to know  i worked with this guy a couple times he said he had this medical scam  they needed some muscle so they brought me in thats it  tell me about this guy  yeah mike i think weve got something  a guy named philip hangs out at a bar in south beach named teases  nice work sam  thanks i got to get some bandaids  nearly getting killed shakes you up no matter how much experience you have  brushes with death are like snowflakes  each one is unique and icy cold  kenny its michael  i need you

problem  dont answer that just go back to the car go  never youre sure  yes i dont know who they are  the guy said he wanted in on the scam  and you told them where i was how to find me what the hell were you thinking  he had a knife  you think im gonna get cut up just to keep your name out of it  i had no choice  they were with that guy kenny the one with the little kid  you know anything about that  maybe they tried to rip him off too  i told you i dont know  could they be cops  theyre not cops that i know  did you tell them about  no man of course not  keep it that way cause that bitch will kill us in a second  and trust me ive seen what she can do  we got more to worry about from her than we do from these guys whoever they are  yeah mike i think we finally got something we can use

measures  when youve spent enough time as an operative  recovering from a brush with death isnt about an appointment with a psychiatrist   or a week in hawaii  its about having a purpose whether its something to fight or someone to hunt
