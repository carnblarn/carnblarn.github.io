                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  mike im telling you dont do it  what you dont like the belt  im not kidding around here you got to put a kibosh on this  sam we talked about this  well maybe we didnt talk about it enough  youre working for the same sons of bitches that burned you mike  and now youre gonna meet with this vince guy  vaughn vaughn  good name for a vampire  im just saying i dont think you thought this through  i dont love working with him  but what were doing is important  why cause simon got out  okay he was a bad guy  okay a very bad guy  but hes stuck in a dungeon somewhere problem solved  if it was just about simon maybe  but the guy who helped him escape has bigger plans  i know you feel this is on your shoulders  but its not your job to solve everything  just walk away  i got an innocent man burned for looking into this  if i stop now  ill have ruined jesse porters life for nothing  okay fine  but i still think vaughn is a vampire name  hey pal  youre looking well  miami sunshine is working wonders for you  well i get a little pasty  when my pals lock me in a secret prison  so hows our project coming  slowly ive been looking through jesse porters files  its a few thousand pages of raw intelligence  yeah  we should talk about jesse porter  what about him  fbi picked him up then released him  they decided it was better to let him go  and keep the incident quiet  hes been laying low  making calls to people around the government  to figure out who stole his files  hes looking for who burned him  dont worry  were gonna have him taken care of  taken care of  look its nothing lethal  were just gonna find him and put him on a plane  to a nice remote holding facility  vaughn thats a mistake  its more efficient to use him as a resource  so you sure youre not feeling sentimental just cause you burned him  no everything we need is inside jesses head  you put me in charge of the investigation  let me handle jesse  phone records  allied financial services  yeah jesse hacked their pbx switch  hes using it to make his calls  bug it boss  that should set you on the way to locating him  just curious  have you thought at all  about what youre gonna say to jesse when you find him  hi im michael i destroyed your life  ill try to avoid that subject  has it occurred to you  that avoiding jesse might be a good idea  youve toyed with him enough  ill do everything i can to help him fi  first i got to find him  well i guess a little sunday breakin never hurt anyone  we got 90 seconds  youd be surprised what i can do in 90 seconds  housed in office utility rooms  a pbx is the phone switchboard for a whole company  using a router with upgraded firmware  pros can hack them to make untraceable calls  from the comfort of their own homes  its how spies get free longdistance  identifying the right line to bug on a pbx  is as simple as matching call times from your records  to those in the computer  of course if you have to comb  through thousands of phone calls  its easier said than done  everyone knows spies are good with languages and firearms  but they need to be great storytellers too  if you cant keep a breakin secret  you have to get creative to cover your tracks  if a companys just laid off half its staff  no one asks many questions  when it looks like an exemployee  broke in to make a mess  taking your sweet time michael  you need to buy us some more time fi  thats our cue to leave michael  what took you so long  i thought you were gonna buy us more time  i knew you were gonna say that  how was that very good  mmhmm    anybody home  mom  mom  whoa  jesus  okay we both get a text   need help now need help now  and you dont answer your phone  we thought you were under siege  well im sorry im not up on texting etiquette  im  im converting the garage to a rental  and i thought you boys could lend a hand  youre taking on a renter  i am  i already have him lined up  he has a cat and hes very nice  do you think this is a good idea  i do i could use the extra money and a little company  uh mom we use the garage for work for um  private private work  you mean building bombs and interrogating people  when you were on vacation in prison michael  i realized something  i could use more stable people in my life  not people who sleep with guns under their pillows  all right mom what do you need done  i promised id tile the garage before he moves in  you know im a little hurt maddy  you never spruced the place up when i was here  thats because hes a paying renter sam  not someone who detonates explosives in my solarium  you know mike some guys listen  to a thing called music while they work  its sort of like talking  only with you know instruments  well that tap on jesses phone line  is our only lead on his location  let the static soothe you  so this uh jesse   he was in counterintelligence eh  and  well i was just thinking you know  these are the guys who interrogate spies  their job is seeing through people like you  like us  i know its risky sam but right now its the only way   hey its jesse porter  you shouldnt call me at home  youre radioactive  i get caught talking to you i lose my pension  look im not dirty somebody set me up  you got to believe me freddy i know  i made a few calls got my hands on something you need to see  okay well what is it do you know who   this lines not secure we need to meet in person  today  all right the park near my place   ocean and lexington  00  well sounds like jesse might have a lead  on the person who burned him  look on the bright side we have his location im calling fi  okay for the record  i already hate everything about this  hows it looking sam  same as an hour ago  all quiet on the western front  mike im projectile sweating down here  im turning my new hawaiian into a dishrag  and you know were talking about a polysilk blend here   dryclean only and its ruined  okay sam you can bill me  damn straight  you know i feel for jesse  alone hauled out  sealed off like toxic waste  i do too fi  trust me i know what hes going through  except jesse didnt wake up next to someone who had his back like you did  as i recall i woke up because somebody kicked me  the point is you have a team  that team may include a washedup old boozehound  youre on speaker fi  you know what i mean yeah whatever  here comes jesse  ooh he is a strapping fellow isnt he  hey fred oh and that must be jesses mystery date  thanks for coming man  got two suvs blackedout windows  something tells me theyre not with the neighborhood watch  how you been you okay  jesse im sorry  what are you gonna do right  okay thats a trap mikey this is not good  theyre gonna have him hemmed in we got to warn jesse  we cant let him see us  if he knows were watching him  here  we cant sit on our hands while he gets ambushed  he wont he can get away  just hang on fi fi hang on  he made me call you  what the hell are you talking about freddy who who made you  he had pictures of me threatened to go to my wife  im retired my marriage is all i got left  freddy what the hell are you talking about whatd you do  sam the bike  locked to the pole behind you   pull the chain off the gears  okay mike tell me what you got and make it snappy  you think that old arm of yours can hit the power lines  are you kidding  this bazooka took annalee high  to the michigan state quarterfinals  ha  wrap a metal chain around two power lines  and you complete a very powerful electrical circuit  it can get you arrested  but its a good way to make a ruckus in a pinch  go go go  you sold me out to khan  i didnt have a choice  youre lucky this guy can handle himself  well hes lucky they had tasers not guns  i guess were not the only ones looking for jesse  we better find him first michael  i drove around his neighborhood for hours  he didnt come back  cops found a body a mile from the park  jesses contact  well i guess he wasnt worth much after the setup  so who the hell were the guys in the suvs  i dont know  give me good news  you find jesse i did   about a minute before he was ambushed  by some amateur extraction team  oh no no no no i asked for good news  jesse got away  do you know if he has any old enemies in town  what am i jesses biographer  im calling you for information  i need you to use some of your resources  find out  youre my resource on this  you wanted to handle this handle it  like engineers and wedding planners  spies obsess over details  if you always keep a lock with the logo facing in  and suddenly you find it turned out  youve got a problem  when you know someones about to get the drop on you  you can play it safe and walk away  or you can pretend nothings wrong  go about your business and get the drop on them  nightclubs closed on mondays  but im guessing youre not here to salsa dance  you must be michael westen i heard you were good  right now im just a guy pointing a gun at your head who are you  my name is jesse porter  ive got a problem that only you can understand  and uh i need your help  its like meeting a character out of a book   michael westen the burned spy  people still talk you know  theres the hewasdonewrong folks  and then theres the theyshouldveshothim folks  which side were you on  never mind what brings you here  i was counterintelligence  someone stole my files i got blamed for the breach  eight years   eight years they just booted me out like it was nothing  im sorry  for what its worth i know how you feel  yeah wellthats actually not my biggest problem right now  i got an old enemy coming after me  i figured you must have a friend in the government  i mean how else could you have survived this long  i just need to talk to someone i have friends but not in the government  your name doesnt even need to come up  ii just  i  i cant help you there  all right  thanks for the yogurt  this old enemy  does he have a name  yeah ming khan  son of a bitch thinks i stole  maybe i could help you there  no man look hes  you dont know him  hes dangerous hes connected  i said i had friends  let me see what i can do for you  why would you do that  part of me thinks that burned spies  need to stick together  yeah what about the other part  the other part thinks  if a counterintel op owed me a favor  and got back in someday  he could put in a good word for me  all right man  you got a deal  you know of any good motels man  i uh  i cant go back to my place  uh you cant go to a motel right now  thats exactly where khan will be looking for you yeah  well figure something out  so im in charge of keeping secrets  from a counterintelligence agent  hes crashing in a vacant condo next door  its not like hes staying in your living room  but he is using my duvet  if another one of your strays ruins my linens  i will kill you  you said yourself  jesse needs someone to watch his back  that is not fair using that argument against me  fine  there are worse things than having  a very cute nextdoor neighbor  in exchange for this downysoft bedding  youve got to tell us all about this khan person  oh um  mmost of its classified so ii cant really   lets be clear  michael is the spy  he cares about words like classified  i on the other hand only care  about who it is im supposed to be fighting  okay  khan was a hotshot in asian drug shipping  got in some trouble with the local authorities  came running to uncle sam to cut a deal  hes a snitch basically  hes trading intel on his terrorist pals  for a life in america you were his handler  yeah got the job of debriefing him  moving his money to us banks  first part went fine money never showed up  the chinese got it in transit poof  and he blames you for stealing his nest egg  yeah not to be crass but have you considered shooting him  id be all for it but khans got some powerful friends  if i take a shot at him theyll come after me next  thats why i wanted to find someone in the government to shut it down  yeah thats not gonna happen  but we may be able to do the next best thing  you know if we can get him busted by the cops  his friends will keep their distance  illegalweapons charges might do it  itll be tough but if we keep it really heavy   rpg  rpg right  oh youre serious  so  so you have like a magic way  of  of setting him up for this  no magic  we get him to buy the weapons  we get him arrested  youre gonna walk up to the guy  start talking to him  im a spy jesse thats what we do  have things changed since ive been out  uh khan is a psycho just so you know  i seriously doubt yall have mutual friends  a mutual enemy will do fine  hey there uh can i talk to your boss  get the hell  ugh  quick and excruciating  few holds are more effective than a simple thumb lock  a little pressure on the right spot  ugh and your target will be learning  how to hold a fork with a new hand  he might want to ice that  hey we need to talk  and who might you be  the names turner  we have a mutual acquaintance jesse porter  jesse porter doesnt ring a bell  does it mr lei  so it was someone else who ran  that halfassed snatchandgrab yesterday  you know i was this close to laying my hands on that son of a bitch  until you guys blew it for me  how did you find us  theres only so many groups of guys carrying serious heat  in chinese restaurants in key biscayne  so what do you want well i want to make a deal  why would we make a deal with you mr turner  because i know where jesse is   unless you guys have never heard of him  and then ill just finish up here and  take my mongolian beef to go  what is it that you want with uh jesse  theres a certain cartel willing to pay top dollar to me  for whats in his head  i think theres a way we can help each other  im listening  your little fiasco with jesse sent him into hiding  hes dug in like a tick   cement wall claymore mine in the door  and youll tell me where this is on what condition  i need some heavy artillery to extract him  im low on funds  i could use a few extra hands  so when we find jesse  were supposed to just what share him  thats what we learned in kindergarten  i mean you get what you need  and then i take him with me  winwin  we will find him on our own thank you  we dont go on armed assaults with randoms off the street  okeydokey  but  good day mr turner  can i take the mongolian beef  i told you a sales pitch isnt gonna do it  khan  khans tempted  we just need to push him a little bit harder  right now they think they can handle you on their own  but well convince them they need help  my help  how do you propose to do that  theres someone i want you to meet  jesse this is sam axe  hes a former navy seal and a friend hey  good to meet you likewise  so mike told me about your problem  i had a buddy pull some paperwork  turns out mr lei rents a place on star island  so heres what im thinking  next time these guys head out for grub  we stage a mock ambush on them  jesse if you can position yourself on the outside wall here  you can hose the place down with your assault rifle  do a triangleofdeath thing drive them into here  when you stop to reload ill swoop in  scare you off and i become khans guardian angel  okay let me see this  i dig it i dig it  just if were gonna do the triangle of death  we got to do it from inside the wall  like right here like in his face  theres an armed guard that patrols the grounds jesse  if you get any closer than that   ill have to deal with a rentathug all by my little self  okay uh quick fyi here   uh we plan our missions with the wacky idea  of getting everybody out in one piece  so just sit back relax  and let us worry about the heavy lifting  so mike you think this is gonna convince khan  to work with you or just that he should pack up and leave  well he thinks jesses got his money  hell do what he has to do to get it  just cover me when i go in  did i mention im not a fan of running a mission  with a kid we barely know   im just saying these counterintel types mike   theyre lone wolves they are not team players  this is jesses best shot to getting khan off his back  hell behave  here we go sam  okay thats where jesses supposed to set up shop  and yet hes still moving  what the hell is he doing  his version of the plan watch my back  hey khan  you looking for me  you want your money come get it  like pro athletes spies know  that no amount of practice or planning  simulates the adrenaline rush of real action  thats why you always have to be ready  to adjust tactics on the fly  if a teammate suddenly decides to shoot at you  to convince the bad guys youre enemies  you go with the flow  and shoot back  unbelievable are you guys trying to die  mr turner at your service  oh come on mike i cant take out four jokers in one go  is this your way of thanking me for saving your hides  you have a bad habit of showing up where you dont belong  are you guys impaired  am i talking too fast is that it  i mean im trying to get jesse  it doesnt take a genius to figure out  that hed try to hit your place after you went after him  you still think you can handle jesse  fine kill me  but the next time he pays you a visit  youre gonna need more than new lawn art  whether its in the field or a showroom  the most powerful move at the end of a sales pitch  is to just walk away  its an effective technique to close a deal  but it can also get you shot in the back  you have a flair for the dramatic mr turner  youve made your point  is that your way of saying youd like my help catching jesse  ill be back tomorrow with a shopping list  crack your piggy bank its gonna cost you  oh and khan  tell your sidekick his safetys on  hey hey  oh yeah sorry about the car  hope youll take a personal iou good as gold  what the hell did you think you were doing back there  kicking ass  what i had to get in close to sell it i got it done no no we got it done  you pull that lone ranger crap again  you and me are gonna dance  really yeah  were gonna dance uhhuh were dancing  i will beat your old ass comen man pull the trigger  oh you think youre just an old man do it do it  calm down calm down  what matters is that im in with khan and lei  you want to finish this when im done fine  we have work to do okay by me mikey  sooner we put them on a platter for the cops  sooner were done with billy the kid here  all right so you got the meeting with khan  what happens if they smell a setup  well cross that bridge later  for now i need them to buy enough artillery  to start world war iii  i dont know what level of experience  you have with this sort of thing  but the trick with a bunker   its not about getting in  its about getting the target out alive  well i need him alive  right so this is what i propose  now i can arrange delivery   three barrett rifles tungstentipped rounds  designed to punch holes in tanks  itll cut through that bunker like its made of tissue paper  a breaching ram militarygrade tear gas  and a grenade launcher  hey we pump in some gas  flush out jesse like the rat he is  this is not even legal  this kind of firepower is way too risky  too risky  you know i spent  interrogating tracking  climbing into caves in afghanistan  you ever done that yeah i didnt think so  i know what it takes to get it done  i say we find jesse on our own  take care of him our own way  you know your boy here is awfully opinionated  last time i checked though jesses hunting you  he makes a point  i been hunting agent porter for a long time  i know what makes him tick  i know what it takes to get what you want from him  but i need the right tools to grab him  if you have the cash  i can get a guy who can get everything we need  now im tired of mr lei  secondguessing everything i say  if we have a deal you say so  otherwise i go my own way  provide an account  where youd like your money wired mr turner  we will make the arrangements  fi khan went for it lets get a truck ready  make it look like im a guy who moves a lot of heavy weapons  any preference on color  ill leave it to you but i need it by tomorrow morning  i got to head to my moms  her renters cat found some of my old detonators  uhoh byebye tenant  yeah he moved out  can you and jesse handle the truck  im sure well be fine  when using a street vehicle to haul serious weapons  some modifications are in order  heavyduty coil springs are used by dune buggies  to race across the desert  add them to your suspension system  and you can hit a few potholes without snapping an axle  a strut brace over your engine  stabilizes your center of gravity  and nothing helps with a fast getaway  like a nitrousoxide tank  connected to your fuel injector  all righty  think thats everything westen needs  for his gun deal with khan  if michael cant make an escape in this  then he deserves to get caught  youre pretty handy with that wrench  youre pretty handy with a gun for a desk jockey  michael told me about your little oneman rampage with kahn  i actually started in the field  they stuck me in counterintel  cause i tended to uh go after all the bad guys  not just the ones they wanted me to get  it turns out some guys can watch a dude  smack his girlfriend around in a bar  and some guys cant  i knew i liked you  michaels gonna be a while  you uhwant to take it for a spin  hell yes  who says christmas only happens once a year  barretts are in the bag here are your launchers  turn that frown upsidedown are we happy  we are  the rest of your money is on its way now  so when do we find jesse  im gonna take you to him lets mount up  just give me a hand with the ammo  spies know the most distrusting people  are often the easiest to manipulate  if you want someone  to drive around with a trunk full of illegal weapons  just insist on doing it yourself  whoa whoa whoa  what the hell do you think youre doing  um putting the guns in  i mean this truck has been specially outfitted  for the weight no way  you think were gonna spend that kind of money  and just let you drive off with them  im not driving off with anything  im meeting you at the bunker  and were just supposed to trust you right  we take the weapons  you know with all due respect mr khan  are you out of your frickin mind  you know how illegal these guns are  your fenders gonna be dragging on the pavement  some port authority stooge is gonna call the cops  right now im more worried about you than the cops  suit yourself  ugh  lift with the knees  yeah hi police  um i think i just saw a drug deal  yeah guys with guns loading bags  uhhuh hyperion road by the port  take the next left two blocks  damn what did i tell you  if you find yourself in a highspeed pursuit  while driving in a caravan  you dont always have to be faster than the cops  you just have to be faster than the guy next to you  of course it helps if you are faster than the cops  aah  hands on your head hands on your head  get up get up  get up get in there  stand up  officer let  let us explain  you have the right to remain silent  you worried about the cops now  jesse its michael again  where are you call me back  four messages  dont you think you might seem a little desperate  he took us out for a 100 thankyou dinner last night  and now he wont return my calls  relax  all his stuff is still at the condo  i dont think jesses the type  to leave without saying goodbye  hes not you  its khan  shouldnt he be in jail  lets find out  khan oh i thought you got pinched  yes  years ago i did a favor  for the people at the drug enforcement agency  it wasnt easy  but my lawyers persuaded them to return that courtesy  oh you were sitting on a getoutofjailfree card  oh thats beautiful  listen give me another day well take another run at it  oh that wont be necessary  you see jesse stuck his head out when he thought i was gone  he was unaware i kept his apartment under surveillance  you got jesse  picked him up two hours ago  weve been trying to get him to talk  but so far he has been uncooperative  you know you said you knew all about jesse  and the art of interrogation  perhaps you could come talk to him  oh itll be my pleasure  yeah you remember our deal though  you get what youre after and then i get jesse  that only works if hes in one piece  ill try not to do any permanent damage  aah  at least the cops have kahns artillery  five of them three of us  its almost a fair fight  but we cant solve this with guns fi  its too easy for them to just kill jesse if things get hot  well do you have a better idea  yeah we need to convince khan to let me take jesse  wait did you hit your head during the car chase  khan is not gonna let you take jesse  until he gets his money  which is a problem because jesse didnt steal it i know fi  were gonna have to convince him  that someone else stole the money  someone who lei  well how are you gonna pull that off  hes khans closest adviser  which means he had access and opportunity  i can sell this you find barry  you have him get everything he can  about the account khan used to buy the guns  if khan pays lei from the same place   we can use it to get leis personal bank account  but if i do get a number  how are you gonna make jesse say it  im gonna bring jesse a cheat sheet  hey baby  i told you on the phone i cant talk now  cause im in a meeting  oh well uh  meeting adjourned scram honey  all right  what the hell was that  you just cost me a client  although that was smokin hot  my business accounts  a bad man bought some guns from me  i need you to trace this wire transfer back to the source  i need information about the original account   transfers linked accounts names dates everything  oh so you only want the moon that cant be done  youre asking me to bribe bank officials  oh youve never bribed a bank official  yeah i have when im looking for new clients  but this is my business  think i got something here mike  you wanted someone who could pass for a relative of jesses   kathy porter from dallas  she passed away five days ago  its the right age right complexion  well that is perfect sam  fi tell me you got something  leis personal accounts are in antigua  looks like khan pays him  you are a miracle worker  yeah im sending you the number now  oh and michael  barry made me promise him dinner  to hear how he can maximize my offshore finances  you owe me yes i do  all right change kathys birthplace to antigua  and we need to adjust the online archive number  you sure you want to play followtheleader with jesse  i mean the guys not exactly great at taking direction  i got him into this sam im gonna get him out  hows our boy  still breathing  he wont speak despite our encouragement  well what did i tell you  if you hurt him it just makes it that much harder  to get anything useful out of him  the man stole a lot of money from me  until i find out what happened to it  hes mine to deal with as i please mr turner  jesse probably spent the money years ago  we should just kill him and be done with it  and stop doing business with strangers  did you guys talk about killing jesse in front of him  in english  i thought so theres your problem  i mean if a man knows hes gonna die  he has no reason to speak up  and how will you motivate him   kind words and a warm cup of tea  no with whats inside this briefcase  few things are more dangerous  than passing a message in plain view of hostiles  to do it you need a reason to get close to someone  you dont get to be choosy about how  looks like we got a bleeder  hello agent porter  now agent porter i know why you havent been talking  you think youll be killed  if you admit you stole khans money  you need to understand something  your life is not the only thing that is on the line  this is an obituary of one kathy porter  killed five days ago in a home invasion  can you see the resemblance  wait wait what for what its worth  she had some nice things to say about you in the end  no what you killed my aunt kathy  you son of a bitch  how else was i gonna find you  you know she put up a good fight for a civilian  she is survived by her sister deborah  you know her as mom  i was thinking about paying her a visit next maybe not  so i want you to look at this picture very closely  when i ask you this question  the money  where did it go  some guy called me  he uh  he said hed kick back 100 grand in cash  if i routed the funds to him to an  an account in antigua  antigua that could be someone connected to our banks  mr khan lets not discuss our personal affairs  i want you to give me the account number you sent the money to now  i dont re i dont know  it  it was a year ago i cant remember  its over the moneys gone lets just shoot him  what did i say about threatening his life  i dont know what his problem is  but if you want to find your money  youll tell him to keep his mouth shut  lei lei enough  jesse may i call you jesse  i want you to think about your aunt kathy  and about her last moments on earth  and whether you want the same thing  to happen to the rest of your family  i want you to look at her and you think about her  does this jog your memory  and dont tell me you dont know  spies  theyre trained to lie  theyre also trained to remember numbers  hes gonna kill me  you think i wont kill her  charlie01  that wasnt so hard now was it  now what youll need to do is find out whose account   youre lying thats mine you stay off him  thats my account how did you get that number  khan you tell him to put that gun down  i have given you everything youve asked for  what are you doing  you know what happens to people who steal from me huh  huh  mr khan mr khan  ive seen that wound before  hell survive but you got to get him to the hospital  that was awfully christian of you  giving khan free medical advice  well i have seen that wound before  and hell be dead in five minutes  oh go through all that trouble to save my ass  and leave the old guy in charge of the getaway  buckle up rookie try not to bleed on the upholstery  got to hand it to you  your little trio can handle its business  yeah we have a few notches in our belt  hey thank you for this  but i see why the condo next door is vacant  theres a bee infestation  its constant buzzing its like im living in a freakin hive  i got to find a new place  well theres no need we have a friend with a space  dont we michael my mom  fi i dont think thats a good idea  she has enough burned spies in her life  well i already spoke to her its done  okay well thank you fiona  why did you go back to your place when khan grabbed you  what was worth the risk  its a saint christophers medal   patron saint of safe passage  it belonged to my mom  she had a thing about keeping us protected  well i guess it worked for you  yeah yeah just not for her  michael  youre the man lets celebrate  what are we celebrating we had a great week  you won jesses trust  now we can root around inside that brain of his  and by this time friday well have everything we need  i wouldnt be too optimistic  im working him for classified details about a conspiracy  if i push too hard hell get spicious  well if you need some help getting him to open up  i have some friends who can help facilitate  torture  the point is michael were on a clock here  so for jesses sake get at it  this is my very best gun cleaner  a little goes a long way  thank you ill use it wisely  hes trouble  i like him  you know its really nice of you to let jesse stay here  but he cant pay you rent  thats all right  hes already offered me several grand in ious  mom i thought you wanted  someone nice staying here who liked cats  now youre sharing gun cleaner  yeah well nice is overrated  and i forgot how much i hate cats  i mean you and sam and fi may be nuts  but you know youre doing something with your life  and ii just like being a part of it  what kind of sissy wouldnt sleep  with a gun under his pillow anyway  love what youve done with the place  dont knock it your moms my decorator  i can tell  hey listen if youre gonna stay here  we should probably talk about why you were burned  i told you i got set up  people dont just get set up for no reason jesse  you asking me about topsecret information westen  well if youre like me  you wont stop kicking over rocks until you find out what happened  youre out in the cold jess  its dangerous to do it alone  yeah so ive noticed  i was looking into some pretty serious stuff  when they threw me out   wars
