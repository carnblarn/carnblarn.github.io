michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  nobody wants to hear from a burned spy  your best bet is to find  an active field operative who cant hang up on you  if youre on domestic soil  the airports not a bad place to look  intelligence agencies are like amateur magicians  watch closely and you can see how they set up their tricks  it doesnt matter how good they are  at misdirection and sleight of hand  they cant make a covertops supply plane disappear   oh mike you just wrecked the most amazing dream  all these beautiful nachos were coming right   runway 3  no flight plan no problem  yep and its not a drug plane had clearance from the tower  its got to be a black flight   bringing toys to all the good little spooks in latin america  mike please tell me this means  i can go back to sleep alone in my own bed  is that how you celebrate these days sam  say it aint so  fi wow you look   like im ready for lunch at the delano  i thought after a week  of you

need to get some records from the faa  you need a drivers licen  i think it makes me look trustworthy  i need to find out who owns the plane who flies it  who registered it  one of those people might be able to pull some strings  get me back in  and you have to find them immediately  theres no time like the present  its time for duane winger to make his move  great im going to lunch  have fun getting your job back  i know you dont like what im doing  but you know its not just about the job  you know that right right  its about patriotism and duty  and the sacred call of whatever  i was told that hell on earth  would rain down on me without an umbrella  i dont know duane  looks pretty sunny out there to me  im gonna enjoy it    prom picture  here we go mr winger  the plane youre asking about is owned by executransport ltd  want to write it down you can borrow my pen   how about you pull the whole file  could i borrow that oh youre bad  we cant sign files out  everything back here is look but dont touch  that is a shame  im gonna level with you im a pi working a messy divorce  sleazebag hubbys hiding the jet under a shell company  one little copy sure would help  itll be our little secret miss  linda  man on pa will duane winger please report to reception  duane winger to reception please  the guy just wanted the files whats the big deal  man the big deal is i just got a call from the deputy director  that file was redflagged  michael when you get cornered theres a rush of adrenaline  as the fightorflight response kicks in  in those moments you cant listen to your body  there are some circumstances  when flight just isnt the right option  fortunately with a little training  and the right kind of hitch knot  all that adrenaline can make you capable  of something pretty close to flight  doesnt help the landing though  barry wanted 1000  just to look into the company that owned that plane   yeah sorry man  he said to get the articles of incorporation  hes got to go up to the capitol  what is he taking a cab to tallahassee  barry  no his mom is up there so hes got to see her  the grand is like an annoyance tax  fair enough   money well spent mikey  you track down the spooks that are flying that plane  get them to call in a few favors  you might not be stuck in miami that much longer  and you wont have to buy me drinks after range practice  subtle sam  thats me mike see the olive  not that im complaining but wheres fi  its not like her to skip our little ritual  usually any chance to pop off a few rounds yeah she wasnt too thrilled  hey you hey you in the sunglasses  can i see that gun aah  careful there oh im sorry  i promise i wont hurt you oh thats good  its you i knew you existed who are you  uh my names spencer ii didnt mean to scare you  i had to make sure it was you  hes the guy right hes some kind of specialops guy  there are times in any spys career  when someone somehow figures out who you are  i really need your help  usually the best approach  is to just put on a good poker face and deny everything  i think you have the wrong idea no no no no no  iive been  ive been monitoring the papers  certain items in the blotter and uh crime rates  policeband chatter and iit all adds up  it becomes very clear not yet it doesnt  no tthe pattern theres a pattern  uh yyou dont just have  oh oh oh hello a series of controlled explosions here  and a dip in violent crime there  you have to ask yourself what is the connection who is the connection  so i think to myself were not talking about spiderman  wwere talking about a real guy who has to practice  so i did a fermi estimate and i got 63 odds  that he lives within a fivemile radius of this gun range so  once you see a pattern you cant unsee it  so youve been staking out the shooting range  looking for  you aand your gun aand your skills  and  and that thing that you did with the  where you   all that seems to confirm to me that you are the guy  no no you have to help me youre the guy  what can i say im not the guy  thats a lie you lied  vvery convincingly as any trained operative would  but listen you have to help me  i dont want to make you but i will if i have to  okay hes  hes an operative this guy hes very famous  hes a rogue agent specialoperatives guy  okay okay fine  were gonna talk boy are we gonna talk  hes the spy so who are you

government contracts   construction energy tech  yeah its a defense firm we know them  well ive seen some things there that i shouldnt have  one of their vice presidents is a  well a killer  okay is this just some kind of a joke shes killed three already  its gonna happen again soon in malaysia if i had to guess  malaysia  im not sure whats going on here  but do you have proof of something  not exactly but how do you explain this   ii used my friend brads workstation  to do some digging around in the system  two days later the gas line at brads house blew up  and he was burned to death  they thought he was onto them so they killed my friend  calm down lets back it up spencer  why were you using brads computer  ii dont have a computer at the office  umi take care of the plants at stone kittredge  ah there it is  i am too busy for a fulltime job okay  do you have any idea  how many messages i have to decode every day  hundreds do you think beings that advanced sleep  im sorry beings  oh oh would you like me to say aliens  the bad ones are from a nearby star system procyon a  uh they  they take our form  they encode their messages in beams of light   gorgeous mathematics wrapped around deadly messages  but the guardians  they are from a planet that orbits around ross 154  and they are being hunted  three of them are dead already  every minute that we waste  okay all right  just calm down a little bit no damn it there is no time  spencer calm down  calm down calm down its okay  yeah excuse me theres something i need right over here  sit down sorry  he started talking about aliens uh crazy stuff  he thought i was a spy   you know like james bond or something  and you guys sure you dont want to file a report  oh no no no we just uh  didnt want to see the guy hurt himself or anybody else  those are the magic words every time this guy goes to court  oh so hes been in before oh yeah  dispatch told us that mr watkowski here  has been in and out of the psych ward for the past four years  bigtime schizo  sad stuff but guys thanks appreciate your help all right  take care  well if youre looking for a silver lining  its nice to know that we can still call the cops huh  cant believe he found me sam   dont worry mike  most people cant decode the secrets hidden in beams of light  i dont know about you but i could use that drink now  a money launderers natural habitat is near rich people  what they save by avoiding taxes  they usually spend on overpriced drinks  but meeting with them is never boring  jesus mike hi  meet me at the chadwicke im poolside bring cash  this text doesnt even have a smiley face  what happened to my friend barry  hey you know i dont like charging you  but that was a big favor  i go up north i got to stay with my mom  shes still mad at me i dropped out of podiatry school  makes me nuts  anyway i needed to unwind the view here helps  a lot   barry  oh okay executransport ltd  youre probably not gonna be shocked to hear  that its a shell company and its registrants dont even exist  officially speaking nobody owns the plane you saw  not shocked no  but it wasnt a total dead end though  theres a real business tied to that plane  north andes distribution  they got a hangar over at the airport  probably packed the cargo on the very flight you saw  not bad barry hey listen  before you go will you help me out here mike  do my back  sam hey mike  look whos back hey man hey  im so sorry to bother you at home especially after  ii shouldnt have done that with the table  your new friend was just explaining  that he hacked the dmv and found your place  thanks to a parking ticket of all things  hes really very clever  so they let you out well they may as well have  the nurses at that place dont even disguise the pattern of the rounds  and the locks there are childs play  oh theres no hard feelings i know you were just testing me  spencer you cant be here  oh youre right we shouldnt be out in the open like this  theyre probably looking for me the aliens  the police i broke out of a psych ward  werent you listening  spencer we cant do anything for you  i know people think my minds not right but i am right  im right about this they killed my friend brad  please just let me show you what i learned  hey i found you didnt i  he doesnt seem that crazy to me  all right show us  okay i was wrong hes totally nuts  sorry about the   well theres something  that i really need to show you in the paper  i cant find anything in this mess  yeah sometimes i lose track of things  when i leave them on the ceiling   no thats  oh okay we can start there  this is the one i was telling you about  three killed in the past four months just like i said  you said aliens this looks like american spies  well the forms they take vary but  youre saying  these men were outed by an executive at stone kittredge  yes thats what im saying wait a second ronald papa  they said this was a climbing accident  mike this guy was a friend of mine i mean i worked with him  oh  oh good so you worked with one of the guardians  no dont do that  i just sent flowers to rons wife last month  so dont be making up stories about real people  oh im not i lost a friend too  my friend brad  tthe one tthey killed to cover it up  the one i told you about  see uh you have to  you just have to read all these  please just read them all  spencer these are just a bunch of newspaper articles  oh no theres a pattern you have to see the pattern  iits all connected  theres a galactic war between these  uh the bad ones  the ones from procyon a are hunting the guardians  and guys like brad who get in the middle  theyll kill them aand then the darkness will come  unless you  its up to you to stop them  spencer i know this guy  hes a good guy hes a good doctor  i want you to meet him  whether youre infiltrating a cartel  or spiking a chemicalweapons sale  the most dangerous people in any covert op  are the ones on your side  if they crack you end up in a shallow grave  thats usually a good enough reason  to avoid working with crazy people  mike michael  diplomat found dead in malaysia  but sometimes you have no choice  oh thats the one see its like i told you  its todays paper  it happened just like he said it would  mike if aliens equals spies  whats wrong  spencer i was really hoping you were just crazy  sam okay let me get this straight  gets the contract  to provide secure communications between american embassies  so they do the usual firewall crap  plus they come up with a code  called zydeco yes  okay and you think somebody there  is intercepting these encrypted emails  and selling the names of american spies  thats your bogus theory  what these procyon beings are really doing  is exposing the guardians from ross 154  right like my buddy ronnie  but how do you know its somebody inside of stone kittredge  and not some whack job on the outside  who just cracked the code uh thats absurd  absurd like aliens are sending me messages  through the pennysaver absurd  zydecos unbreakable its a fourkilobyte code  of miss reynolds on my phone  bigger than that no an algorithmic code  that takes up four kilobytes of space is beyond secure  it would take longer than the whole life of the universe to crack it  that  thats impossible the the theres no way  youd really need the code to read those messages  all right fine relax  maybe theres another way that we can do this  will you sit down  no no no there there she is thats her  iin the black thats shannon park  her team created zydeco think she kept a copy  yeah yeah and i know she has access to the embassy email system  that much i saw myself  thats how my friend brad got killed  she thought he was onto her  yeah no im telling you  she  shes a murderer and a traitor  aand you can see how she takes our form  but i swear shes an alien  lets stick to earth problems  we need to look at shannons files  if she has an unauthorized copy of zydeco  we can get her busted  nnno you cant get into her system  its fort knox  no iii tried to get in remotely and i couldnt do it  we hit her office we bury a keystroketracking program  come back the next day for her password  we get the emails and the code    no no im sorry i dont mean to laugh but shes   no the these are very advanced beings  no shed be able to tell if you were on her computer  ii think shes a little out of your league  okay mr computer is she out of your league  we need you to get us access at stone kittredge spencer  jeremy dresner consulting in it  there should be a visitor badge in the system for me  in medieval europe  spies used to pose as lepers and plague victims  so they could snoop around without being bothered  in todays corporate office  posing as it works the same way  its the perfect cover  if you need to linger without being bothered  and it gives you a pretext for talking to almost anyone  ms park jeremy dresner it alexandria office  i need to speak with you  great make an appointment no problem how about now  excuse me  were doing an internal audit of security procedures  i have the paperwork right here  we were told your whole department would be cooperative  ms park  well thats funny jeremy  cause im the head of this department  and nobodys said word one to me  well here i am and were way past word one now  security is our business on this wing  your business is installing software upgrades  so i suggest you have somebody up on 14  give me a call about this  and i suggest they send somebody else next time oh i bet they will  ill bet theyll send you up to see me shannon  im looking forward to it    can i borrow your bathroom key  youre my hero  all you need to beat a modern tumbler lock  is a little information and some stoneage tools  if you know the basic type of key you need to spoof  pick out a matching blank  file down the valleys to the center ledge  and you have a bump key  apply torque whack it with anything handy and youre in  not quite as much fun as kicking a door down  you ready to go  to dinner its 430  i told you no more earlybird specials  yeah i thought we would stop by the airport first  pay a visit to that front business barry found  more spy hunting  michael why must everything you do  revolve around getting your old job back  fiona really this is important  oh michael come on  ill do it alone  were gonna have to do this eventually  yeah  just not right now  drug cartels arent the only organizations  who use importexport businesses as fronts  intelligence agencies like them because they make it possible  for missions to finance themselves  who parked that gray truck out there  wheres your boss  they send out guns and supplies and get back goods to sell  native antiquities are favorites  because their subjective prices make money laundering easy  are you the manager  no mr westen  im diego garza im the spy youre looking for  youre really not supposed to tell people youre a spy  whats the point in subterfuge  all the memos they sent from dc  they say youre very very good  i have to assume youre here because you want back in  trying to reach out  i like you diego youre doing all the work for me  i dont want this to hurt your feelings  but id really like you to get the hell out of here  not everything they told you about me is true  well the part about me being really really good  but i just want to talk to your bosses so we can clear this up   i wish it was that simple  i have 20 years at the company ive seen villages burned  ive seen children orphaned ive been shot twice  and then they transferred me here  now you know what the hardest part of this job is  that forklift turns funny  now if i report back that i made contact with a burned spy  do you know where theyll send me  me neither but im not rocking this boat  im giving you a chance to be a friend  mr westen i dont like threats  but i love your sunglasses   you have a good one

page of numbers to the fbi  i need the code oh i dont like this  does she have it or not no i dont see it  look though look at this  she wiped all her bank records within 24 hours  of accessing the system  here here again  every time she  spencer spencer i need you to focus  theres no point in her intercepting the emails  if she cant decrypt them  no no listen every time theres a payment   yesterday today twice oh she sent two more names out  oh i dont know where its gonna happen next  i dont know whos gonna die two more but   spencer its gonna be fine if you find the code right now  no i told you its not here shes too careful  she must borrow the copy that they keep in the scif room  and put it back when shes done  oh god i shouldve seen it  wait now youre telling me that her copy of the code  is in a scif room  thats a vault oh no im sorry im sorry  the pattern i didnt see it i didnt see any of this get out of the chair  which brings us to the finley method  oh excuse me im sorry are you leaving us  i have work to do  folks be right back turn to page seven  hey hey whoa whoa whoa whoa  hey shannon whoa whoa whoa whoa  im sending myself a copy of everything encrypted  lets go  lets hit the reset button do it together  hit the button lets reset the clock  no wait we have to  we have to take her machines  no we have to take her machines  we have to find the names she could have buried it spencer  no we  we have to warn the guardians no we have to  the darkness will come  the darkness will come and youll see  youll look up the stars will go out  and every night every night    we can be positive shannon this is all about  thats enough   youre killing me here oh come on  enough  come on spencer come on  theyre all gonna die  we dont have the code theyre all gonna die  spencer i could   iill try to hack into shannons computer again remotely  if i leave a line open  maybe i can catch her when she uses the code  you cant  if you get caught  she can trace where you live and  she sent more names  we dont know who or where but we know theyre gonna die  and those files you stole from her computer  are useless without a copy of zydeco  well thats not true we can use  theres no point in trying  no theres no use in even  even   even attempting to break that code  you understand the whole life of the universe  listen please no i know youre trying to help  but if you think you can break in to the scif room to steal that code  no im sorry thats never gonna happen  you see theres a ninedigit keypad  im not going  and shannon and her friends from procyon a  wont just sit back and watch    spencer michael isnt going to decrypt  the emails that shannon stole  hes going to use them as a prop to scare her  no i dont see that    were gonna convince her that someones hunting for the leak  shell stop selling names cover her tracks  well tip the fbi  when she goes to erase the scif rooms access code  shell be arrested and no more spies die  theres justice for your friend  the alien goes to jail  oh well that sounds good is that what you were gonna say  if you want to keep your job  keep walking keep your voice down and act casual  we dont have a jeremy dresner in virginia i checked  who are you and  the people we both work for  dont know my name and neither will you  im the guy cleaning up your mess thats all you get  what mess two days ago you were an it guy  two days ago i was shaking the tree  theres a leak coming from tech thats your department  were staring down the barrel of a federal case  and a massive pr disaster  zydecos compromised  three american operatives are already dead  this is ridiculous  i dont know who you are im calling my boss  go ahead use mine if youd rather deal  with a massive federal investigation  shannon the feds are just sniffing at this now  we got two days  after that your stock options  wont be worth the paper theyre printed on  this doesnt make any sense  that embassy system is airtight zydeco was my project  believe me honey i know it was  where did you get that  i need you to call upstairs  cancel all your appointments for the day  theres something i need you to see  two weeks ago i get a call from one of our employers  one of your programmers in your department  got himself blown up   brad wilkins  they asked me to have a look  cops said that was an accident  yeah miami dade detectives make 56 grand a year  how much do you think i make  they didnt even know about this boat  your boy brad had it registered under his mothers name  he was careful just not careful enough whered he get those  thats what were trying to find out try to keep up honey  notes in the margins  now i learned about the leak  because brad found out about the leak  he was hunting them  why he didnt share this news i dont know  but he sure did get himself killed what do the notes say  he wanted to look at the scif access logs  now i do thats eyes only  im not gonna show you that you absolutely will  tomorrow is saturday there will be nobody in the office  youll meet me here at 1000 so i know youre clean  then we go have a showandtell  cellphones are basically wireless computers  what is this  upload the right program  and youve got a roving bug you can turn on remotely  you will keep that on you  if you need to talk to me before tomorrow morning  you will use that not the office not the home phone  last person who looked into this leak was killed  you never know whos listening  what if were  tomorrow morning  no excuses you be here    we dont know whos listening  guess were up and running  hey howd virgils boat work out  did i ever tell you about the marlin we caught  off of pigeon key yeah a few times  hey do you mind keeping an ear on shannon tonight  i got to head down to the airport  see if i cant motivate our pal diego  front companies generally make easy targets for burglary  they dont want people wondering  what they have to hide  so they tend not to install a lot of lights  alarms and security cameras  and of course  theyd never invite the police in to investigate  so theres really no need to be shy about leaving clues  but you got to admit its elegant  we catch shannon wiping the access log tonight  and she goes to jail  its not the crime its the coverup  fiona i understand the plan i just dont like it  i wish we could forget about this catchherinthe act  callthefeds nonsense and drive to her house right now  and finish this properly  i should be home in bed right now  hey hey dont be dozing off out there  freaking amateur hour around here   yeah hold on  shannon yeah its shannon you find it  you sure you want to do this  i told you theres heat on me at work  an ip address at that location tried to hack me  some nut from the office  i am not taking chances we got to tie this up cleanly  you cannot be around   ill put a timer underneath the house same as brad  it goes off at midnight ill be long gone by then  good and get off the phone  fi did you hear that  spencer stuck his neck out and she caught him  itll take me 20 minutes to get to spencers  im gonna have to leave the front door open here  what if she comes to wipe the access log  no screw it  hes all the way on the other side of town  i cant get there you got to go        hey sam do you need some bowls  mike you got to get to spencers house  shannon set a bomb its under the house  its gonna take me well fi said 20  i got my money on you mikey get your ass in gear    spencer no no no you cant be here  im not one of them night is when they come  michael fi weve got a minute come on  you cant talk to him when he gets like that  if youre here  we missed her shes gonna erase everything  man did you see the news nobody was home  i should have triggered the bomb in person  shannon dont do not secondguess me  i took care of the thing at work  we should be clear ill call you  on the phone messages from procyon a dont usually   no they come on beams of light  this must be a special occasion you know desperate times  you tried to hack her files from your house didnt you  yeah we were in such a rush before  i thought if i took one more shot  wwere they talking about killing me  youre gonna be all right oh no no no no  no theres no way to catch her you heard her  she wiped the evidence  were going to have to convince her to give us some new evidence  now that youre the only one she has reason to be afraid of  youre going to have to help  oh no oh what are you  how  well for starters youre gonna have to be able to string two sentences together  youre gonna have to talk to shannon facetoface  you got to be kidding me  no no shes one of their leaders  even the guardians fear her  spencer this is really important  you must stick to the script  you cannot mention aliens light beams or any of it  shannon cant find out we know what she is  she cant find out that her covers blown  shell call in for backup  all the other beings  okay that makes sense  there is no leak  i checked the scif access log theres nothing  i think we need to consider the possibility that brad   there is a leak but we got bigger problems  somebody else found out  i got a call this morning from a spencer watkowski  youve seen him he waters plants at the office  hes exnsa hes a real heavy hitter  thats impossible  the guy  hes a nut hes way off  yeah nice cover dont you think  he wants to meet but what i cant figure out  is why he wants you there with me  breathe spencer  michael i said no surprises whyd you bring a bodyguard  because shes the one whos selling names of american spies  and she killed my friend brad wilkins and she tried to kill me  youre the leak  thats not true it is true  shes a murderer and a traitor  if you want this to be kept quiet  then im gonna need 5 million in cash  you dont have a shred of proof oh yeah i know everything  i know your whole dark plan and i know that youre one of them  ms park is one of those people  who doesnt cover her tracks as well as they think  yesterday her password was gold leaf 1510  have you changed it yet shannon  ooh yeah you should see her computer  shes got zydecoencrypted emails that look like this  aand when she decodes them they look like that  thats a fake  he doesnt have the code hes bluffing  jesus this is pathetic  if you want to stay for this charade you can  im leaving  im bluffing then how do i know that youre setting up a deal  to sell another name to the venezuelans  5 million  ill bring the cash here at 1000  youll bring a copy of everything you have  fine but dont try and bring any backup and you dont try and bring  any of your friends from procy itll just be me and the money  venezuela how did you   oh the patterns sometimes when you study them long enough  also i saw a file labeled caracas  when i tried to hack her but i couldnt get in so  michael i cant believe youre this stupid  you put a hit out on him who else knows a thug hes nobody  i found him in a biker bar he knows nothing  youre gonna give me his name and his address im cleaning this up  why did you agree to pay them why not just kill them too  you really think im gonna pay them  no were going back to the office  youre gonna give me a copy of zydeco  im gonna pin that on their bodies along with some embassy emails  i dont understand what do you think is gonna   are you really this slow  it has to look like spencer stole the code  and the emails from an embassy  if the problem is on the clients side  then were protected  stone kittredge stock doesnt take a hit  i cant get into the scif room on a weekend without people finding out  do you really think youre gonna keep your job  todays your last day honey  youre gonna run and youre never gonna stop  you understand  is that zydeco yeah  where are the emails  my computer but we have to print them out  from a printer outside the building  so the feds cant trace them  yeah i may skip that part  hey what   this isnt goodbye  ill say hi at your trial  no  hey  hey  lets see if this works   this is special agent johnson  hello hi hello  this is um never mind  i was just calling because theres a traitor  locked in the scif room at stone kittredge  what did you say  yeah and theres a gig of state department emails  on shannon parks computer so youd better get down here  and you really should bring some backup  that bitch is an alien    maybe he got abducted  hey sorry im late thanks for meeting me  ii dont really trust the phones so  i wanted to be sure you saw the thing in the paper  shannons copping a plea michael we saw it  shes going to testify against the guy who killed brad  you ask me somethings wrong with the world  when we dont hang traitors anymore  doesnt seem right  you look good spencer  oh really well i feel a little foggy  but tthe meds arent great but they come with the job  so  so its worth it sam i hooked him up with a crypto gig  buddy of mine has a tech firm how you liking it spence  oh its great its great  in fact oh llook im late i should probably go  you know ill walk with you i have to make a stop myself  and you guys thank you  thank you for  for listening to me  you probably shouldnt have listened to anything i said but im glad you did  spencer  you got him a job  i actually am kind of a sweetheart  so theres one more thing i wanted to tell you about all the aliens  uh spencer i thought that you were  oh oh no no  ii know theyre not real i just wanted to explain  well iin the beginning the first messages  this light in the window  this  this beautiful equation   i should have just said something  ii should have just told people  but it was  it was all secret and in code  and  and i didnt have anyone i could trust  aand youre lucky
