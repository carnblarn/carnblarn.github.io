                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you   a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  give us the man who killed our operatives  and you and i can have a little chat about your future  when carla finds out you hid me your questions will be resolved   with headshot for both of us  what does it have to do with me  its all a way to get to mike get your bag well go  crap we got to create a distraction  its not a goodbye its just in case  managements on the way  any story i tell them has to begin with victors dead body  finally  they get me alive theyll take me apart  get out while you can  i want you people out of my life  all your old enemies did they just forget about you  or has someone been keeping them at bay you want out  youve no idea what hell will rain down  if we stop watching out for you  ill take my chances  as an operative  you get used to being in uncomfortable situations  whether its resisting interrogation  in a foreign prison fighting guerilla forces in a tropical jungle  or swimming five miles to miami beach in your suit pants  its just part of the job  whats harder to get used to  is going into a situation you dont know anything about  just because youre exhausted and disoriented  doesnt mean you can stop looking out for trouble  danger isnt always obvious  it can be as subtle as a glance from a friendlyseeming tourist  a car that slows down at an odd time  or a cop that suddenly seems a little too interested in you  sir  get back here  i think he ran into the hotel send all available units  the backbone of most hotel phone systems  is secured by nothing more than a door and a cheap lock  which makes them convenient for people  who need to make quick untraceable phone calls   youre all right  more or less  your helicopter ride was not as long as i expected   howd it go  it was interesting  it looks like the people who burned me  are gonna leave me alone for now anyway  thanks for saving my life  its always a treat to get you out of trouble  i appreciate it  i checked the police radio for news of our adventure  there was a call about a mystery man washing up on the beach  a goingaway present from your helicopter friends  how bad  you wouldnt happen to be at the mcalpin hotel  the police think youre armed and dangerous  ill have to find another way out  now is not the time to blast your way out of a building  talk to the cops now or get ready for a citywide manhunt  fine can you call sam  see what he can figure out about my situation  of course  and michael  im glad youre alive  try to keep it that way  just because you can escape from a situation  doesnt mean you should  its a riskreward thing  sometimes you have to take your chances  down on your knees hands behind your head  sometimes you have to remember  its easier to dodge questions than bullets  thanks for coming sam what do we know  the bad news is youre still as burned as ever  youre still the top of the travel watch lists  and your assets are frozen like popsicles   and the good news  the good news is that  your status has changed  whatever magic they were working  to keep you out of the police computers they stopped  youre back on the radar of foreign agencies too  the good news is im being investigated by the cops  and the foreign intelligence agencies  yeah its a change   its progress of a sort  any luck getting me out of here  until they charge you with something theres not much i can do  theyre stalling i guess somebody hasnt been talking much  memory loss you know how that is  the cops they love that one  and you know the wholeno id no bank account  thats not helping so i had to be in touch with your mom  trying to dig up a drivers license or something   my mom is she okay  yeah  shes just a little upset about the  you know the house blowing up its not the whole house  its just the the sunroom  it came out okay but the bottom line  is youre better off in here until your ma cools off  just sit tight mike oh one more thing  your shades got delivered to the loft  along with this  as a spy  you expect to get locked up from time to time  if youre on the job you just keep busy  until someone negotiates your release  if youre working alone  you may have to get used to steel bars and baked beans  all right you lets go   go where  youve been released   why has something changed  i dont know  you want me to check to see if you can stick around  now where can i get myself a pretty shirt like that  harlan   harlan what are you doing here  thats it  i havent seen you since what lebanon bosnia   dont i get a hey old buddy  hey old buddy  i heard through the grapevine that you were in the clink  so i called sam axe and offered my help  one of my security clients is a big lawyer  and he accused them of holding you as a political prisoner  i got a big laugh out of that one   michael westen and nelson mandela  thanks harlan  i just got you out of jail bud  dont i get some love here  look at you  i track you down for ages and suddenly youre popping out computer databases  poof right out of the blue  theres stuff on there about you going rogue selling secrets  someone wanted to use me make sure id no other options  they fabricated a bunch of stuff and used it to burn me  axe told me anyway i got my ass on down here  come on ill give you a ride  look whos here its good to see you michael   mom  so glad youre not dead  i did a little remodeling with sam you like it   im so sorry mom  whos your friend  this is harlan  we did some work together in some other countries a while back  its very nice to meet you mrs westen  its always nice to meet michaels mysterious acquaintances   mom hes a friend  when we were in those other countries  mike always used to say how much he missed his mom  youre a bad liar harlan i like that about you you want a beer  sure sounds good  sam and fi are in the back drawing up plans to fix this mess  i imagine they could use some help  harlan tell me about yourself what do you do  you destroy houses too  im telling you  its harder rebuilding a sunroom than blowing the damn thing up  you have no one to blame but yourself if you blow something up correctly  you have nothing left to fix   look who came home from jail  its nice to be home  hey i hate to rain on the whole homecominglovey thing  but we got problems  carlas people were the only thing keeping the cops off our backs  not to mention  who are looking to put a bullet in you  thirddegree burns prevent acne  it doesnt mean you set your head on fire  the point is we got a whole new set of worries  we need all the help we can get   i was talking to harlan earlier and  you talking about the gig  the gig   you told him  i was about to  were helping a girl that he met pays top dollar  axe volunteered you and fi for duty  sorry didnt mean to just spring this on you  no worries he does this for fun  my familys farm and told us to move  they said that it belonged to an american company now  i was doing security for a company down there  these corporations are bribing officials down south  to steal land and its all run in miami  they paid a judge to put my father in prison  its only a matter of time before he dies  i checked it out  the guy who runs the scam is rufino cortez  hes wanted in venezuela as part of a corruption probe  hell spook if they try to extradite him we gotta grab him off the books  he goes down we take a few corrupt judges with him  sunshines a great disinfectant  if we do this its not just for martas family  rufinos been going after all kinds of folks down there  marta lets go get something to drink ever had a mango mojito  whats going on  and dont tell me it was coincidence  that you bailed me out of jail  and then you just happen to have a job for me  no i  listen im sorry its just  ive been seeing her when i heard this thing  you needing help i figured that id   kill two birds with one stone  this rufino  hes evil  hes had people come after him so hes guarded like the pope  but i think ive got an angle   i need some help  my help  you always were the smart one and i was the pretty one right  listen i looked her in the eye and i told her i would help  please mike  ill see what i can do  when i scouted this place  i thought michaels gonna love this   get to play dressup  whats your plan  this is rufinos club hes here every night  i figured wed have a better time separating him  from his security team in here than outside  is that what you figured  hes back there private booth  you know hes the boss  i forget how they say it in spanish  hes a real charmer  that scumbag next to him is falcone  rufinos main man here in miami  you see the guy almost always has a security detail  even taking a leak  almost always  except for when he takes his nightly skirt to the back private room  in the highest security places uniforms are for show  the real security doesnt announce itself  with anything but wary looks and shirts loose enough to hide a gun  come on  the old perv does his thing in there that door there goes out to the alley  we just grab rufino and hustle him out  i conned a key from the storage company  youd have been proud of me classic mike westen   harlan hold on  now we just hang tight  you think a guy like rufino would allow the most sensitive part of his club   to be beaten with a storage key  what else do we need  how about the alarms code  break that i need a pry bar  security devices are generally oneway  they keep people in or keep them out  most highsecurity locks  are a lot less secure if you come at them backwards   what are you doing open up  just like old times   just like old times  open this door  my god   men with guns are you alright  it was fine   its gonna take longer to grab rufino  how much longer   my fathers not well we cant do  were working on it okay  were just gonna use a different plan next time  yeah can you give us a minute babe i need to talk with mike  hey i got careless man im sorry you know it just   it seemed like it was the right play  its all right  no you know its like how you always used to say  dont get personally involved but  im involved and i got sloppy  kind of proves my point though i needed your help right  anytime harlan  so what happened to you man you just disappeared for all that time  whoever burned me wanted me out of sight  they were powerful enough to make it happen  now youre just a burned spy tossed out into the cold huh  might as well tattoo a bullseye on your forehead  thats one way of looking at it  well now youre helping me with marta  listen  no matter what happens from here on out i got your back brother  thanks harlan and ill do the planning next time  you got it  hey sam feeling thirsty  rufino cortez are you serious  you want to grab rufino cortez  im gonna need another mojito  have as many as you want just tell me about him  hes a bagman for this landgrab thing down in venezuela  its a lot of money a lot of guns not my style  im more of your friendly neighborhood  hide your cash from the tax man kind of guy  and rufino  rufino is a rob and kill for hire  and call it an investment kind of guy  we need you to put together a package  make mike look like somebody rufino would want to talk to  business records bank accounts  just promise me youll have rufino out of miami before tax season  can do  you know when your father was alive he used to do all the repairs himself  yeah i wanted to talk to you about that  the walls were made with four different kinds of lumber  frank used to just go out and find stuff  i wouldnt call tearing wiring out of your neighbors air conditioner  finding   hey guys  oh look  theres the guy who blew up my house  nice to see youre having such a sunshiny day sam   sam whose car is that the buick  maddys neighbor  i took it over there to drop it off and well we got a little friendly  so shes letting me hang on to the car  mrs reynolds youre romancing an 80yearold woman for a car  im talking about her daughter miss reynolds  shes 39 going on 22  great lady great car   hey howd it go  good mikeys all set  hes got a meeting with rufinos guy falcone later today  awesome thats great  mike your new cover id  youre tom wellington esquire  lawyer for a shady international investment group  hey you wanna pick the names you gotta go to the meeting  and listen to barry talk about his skincare regimen  highstatus cover ids are rarely effective  claim to be a big shot and people get suspicious  claim to be a big shots errand boy people dont think twice  act like you dont want to be there because youre tired  youre underappreciated or youre sick  and people tend to trust you even more  mr falcone   mr wellington  thank you for coming  word is  if i wanted a meeting with mr cortez you are the man to talk to  i am indeed you can think of me as the gatekeeper  now i had a look at your proposal mr wellington  very attractive  tell me why is it that your investors  are so interested in land in south america  listen im just a lawyer on the deal  my job is to set up a meeting with cortez and my clients  these clients of yours tell me a little more about them  theyre people who want to meet with mr cortez  people with security concerns thats all i can say  ill wait for your call  i dont mean to be rude  but you know mr cortez has security concerns of his own  im just here to set up the meeting i have attorneyclient privileges  i understand and respect  the importance you attach to your professional ethics  but you see in my profession we have our own code  a code that compels me to break your arm  if you dont answer my question do you understand  i dont know their names okay  they chose me because i had no connection to them all right  i see  now mr wellington  sometimes people try and steal from us or they talk to the police  do you wanna know what happens to them does that interest you at all  nope no i just want to make the deal okay man  would you  please let go of my arm  please  well i think we understand each other  be at the train yard in kendall tomorrow morning at 1000  like a wedding  an armed extraction requires a lot of planning  if you want it to go well  and like a wedding its not the sort of thing you want to do twice  which is why you hold a rehearsal before the big day  seriously michael you just let him dislocate your shoulder  it was either that or lose my cover id  couldnt you have just you know accidentally snapped his neck  make it look innocent  i like her style you should listen to her more  thank you harlan its nice to be appreciated  okay lets do this  this guy knows what hes doing  i couldnt have picked a better location myself  theyll come in from over there its the best visibility  i think our only play is to create a distraction over there  how distracting  more than a firecracker less than a neutron bomb  anyway  theyll fall back to there  we go in heavy as a son of a bitch and shoot their car to pieces  his security holds us off so the vips can escape behind those containers  where ill handle falcone and grab rufino  what could be easier  easy on the explosives fi  were trying to nail this guy on corruption charges  it could be tough if hes in little pieces  itll save on shipping  fine  what do you think michaels gonna do now that hes just a  miami resident  well hes still burned and hes still mike so   i wouldnt say hes a miami resident  you know what i mean  you think hes ready to leave it behind and just live  i think its a little tricky can you help me with this  answer the question sam  i think hell try and get back in  why when hes got so much here  he might be able to make money finally  and look at harlan he might be getting friends  he did his government work as you call it for a reason  for what his country  what have they done for him lately other than betray him  leave him for dead ruin his life  the fact that you have to ask means youre never gonna get it fi  hey sister dont be throwing explosives at me  just cause you cant take the cold hard truth  any ambush depends on knowing  where your target is going to be and when  unfortunately there are times when the only way to put  your target in the line of fire is to be there yourself   you see anything hercules  nothing yet boss  those are the times you just have to trust your team  and hope everything goes right  wheres mr cortez  unfortunately he couldnt be with us today  im authorized to discuss any terms  what  we agreed mr cortez would be  i find it best to keep agreements flexible mr wellington  where is rufino  my job is to meet with mr cortez not you  if he finds out that my clients are doing a deal with someone else  its your ass  yeah just pull the arm out again feels good  i dont get to go back to my client  without anything short of a meeting with rufino  i said you can discuss this with me  and i said i can do it with rufino you dont like it shoot me   lets go in  no  fi starts the show when she sees rufino we move then  why are you waving me off  is this supposed to scare me  is that what this is  let me be clear you can shoot at me as many times as you want  but unless i get a facetoface meeting with rufino  i cannot give you what you want  youre a determined man mr wellington  ill tell you what  ill call you with a place and time well pick you up  youll meet mr cortez in the car  if he likes what you have to say well see about this deal  if not  and i meet with mr cortez on the way  ill be there  now i assume ill be meeting with the actual mr cortez this time  thats a nice combo  what its good this way   you get the pickup location mikey  train tracks on 10th street  looks like the meeting is gonna be on the move so no one can hit it  have to hit it on the move then  security levels vary widely for different kinds of vehicles  so do you guys do this sort of thing a lot  more than most  i suppose  garbage trucks for example are expensive  but the fact that theyre hard to hide and harder to sell  means that you dont find a lot of garbagetruck alarm systems  how long did you and michael work together  about a year  you know hes a pretty damn good guy to have around when things get rough  yeah he has his moments  listen thanks for helping out with this seriously  you want to pay me back  take michael for a beer tell him life is worth living  when youre not sneaking around for the government  will do  go  so im thinking theyre gonna follow the tracks  make sure nobodys after them  when they get to dollars to doughnuts they turn around  come back down this way to drop you off when theyre done  and we hit them right there  sounds good sam  harlans got some venezuelan commando types coming to take rufino  so i poked around  sounds like these guys are frothing at the mouth to get this guy down there  murder corruption conspiracy  nice leather briefcase shame to ruin it  guess its for a good cause  in close spaces a knifes often more effective than a gun  easier to handle easier to hide  and in the right hands scarier  when you asked to borrow your fathers old briefcase  you didnt mention you were planning on stabbing someone   this is more of a just in case  in case what  im gonna get a beer a fresh one from the garage  mom   forget it i dont wanna know  its probably better  i do wanna know if youve given any thought at all  to what you might be getting your friend harlan into  hes nice but hes not exactly a rocket scientist  hanging out with you isnt the safest thing to do   mom hes special forces  whatever  hes got a lot to prove with you its written all over his face  thats dangerous  you know hes your friend  but if something happens to him im just warning you  are you through here  ive one more thing to do  the rolling meeting is a popular security measure  among highend criminals  its hard for law enforcement to bug  and its a lot easier to detect any surveillance  do it in an armored car with an armed team  its not just a secure place its a fortress on wheels  i love these suvs theyre roomy  if youre going to take on that fortress  youd better have an army  mr wellington meet mr cortez  its an honor to get a meeting with someone so shy  lets focus on the matter at hand  your clients want to buy a lot of land in my country mr wellington  coffee plantations soybeans corn   these are men of great appetite  i just do the paperwork  i ask myself who needs so much land  farm importers dodging taxes  chemical companies dumping waste  or perhaps  an american lawenforcement agency  you think im a cop youre joking  you think im wearing a wire you wanna check look nothing there   nothing there you wanna see this  thats enough  can we do this please  a deal like is means many enemies  there will be officials to bribe  judges  lives will end  tell me why i should do a deal with ghosts  who hide behind numbered bank accounts and lawyers  i dont like this stop the car  wait a second here  what the hell  come on mikey somethings wrong they stopped  do you think that i dont want to tell you  get out youre done  when an operation depends on clockwork timing and position  you have to do whatever it takes to make sure it comes together  i cant go back emptyhanded please you dont know who im dealing with  these guys are serious its a billion dollars  the way these people work if i dont close the deal  theyll put a bullet back of my head and theyll find another guy to do it  i cannot go back to these guys  and say sorry men the deal didnt go through  just hear me out please  fine  tell me more  okay were back in business you guys ready to go   do you have to ask  ready ready  and fiona  the principles behind a snatchandgrab are straightforward  separate the target from security  then keep the security occupied while the target is acquired  simple enough but like anything its all in the execution   what the hell  get down  theres a reason its called bulletresistant glass not bulletproof  the right bullet will take out any glass  put the gun down gun down gun down  youve a slug in your engine block your team is pinned down  and im leaving with your boss  if i were you id think about another line of work other than security  nice work jefe  that was a beautiful thing mike just like the old days buddy  itll be a beautiful thing when we get rufino on a boat to venezuela  everythings taken care of the teams gonna pick him up at dawn  man im sorry  i forgot to tell you theres one change in the plan  theyre not coming for rufino  theyre coming for you  its sam again  its been a while were just worried about you call me when you get this  think we should order him another couple of drinks  youve ordered four beers and two coffees you stop ordering  when someone doesnt show up after three hours  right but he was so specific we ditch the truck  they ship off rufino we meet them here   they should have at least checked in  how well did you know harlan  i dont know we did four or five missions  always had your back   you think  i think sometimes people change  jesus what a beautiful night smell that ocean air  you sure this is the smart play here harlan   dont you talk to me about smart play  how long have we known each other  not long enough for you to show me a little respect  is this how you get respect you betray a friend and kill a man  as a matter of fact yes i spent a lot of time  carrying the bags kicking down doors getting the guns ready  i need a change  please dont do this youre making a mistake  i disagree i got to say im pretty proud of this  rufinos partners back home are getting a little nervous  about this anticorruption thing  they knew the federales want to bag him start a big probe  so they asked me for help yeah they asked me  i went the white knight with marta and i got myself the gig to grab  and when you showed up on the radar it was perfect  i get someone to help me out with the old man   thanks for that by the way  no problem  of course we needed somebody to blame for smoking rufino  im gonna give the federales mike westen  the dirty spy who denied them their chance for justice  you were the cherry on top of the whole thing   and marta  marta  rufino stole every farm within 50 miles  its not too hard to find some desperate chica who needed my help  shes very grateful  you should think about that while you stand in front of the firing squad  it might help you feel better  you know fiona wanted me to talk to you  she wanted me to tell you that theres a life after youre done being a spy  not very long in your case  listen  how do you know you can trust rufinos partners  whats stopping them from turning on you the way they turned on him  man dont you dare patronize me  im not patronizing you you won you beat me  youre smarter than me im just asking you to think about it  youre better than this i know you  youre a patriot we served together  you sure this is who you wanna be  a mercenary betraying his friend for blood money   im sure  thats all i needed to know  pretty clever mike but i still can kick your ass  when youre trying to hide in the water fire is your friend  the light turns the surface of the water into a mirror  then its just a matter of finding a place to surface  where the fire isnt consuming all the oxygen  you think youre gonna run  make it out to the road  give it a shot buddy  come on mike  lets do this  just you and me  right now man to man buddy  one of the things covert operatives have to give up  is the idea of a fair fight  spies arent trained to fight fair  spies are trained to win  im sorry  yes who is this  the man on the docks there  the one who you wanted to get rufino cortez for you  he works with rufinos partners  they wanted to make sure he was dead before the trial  you want to put someone on trial harlans the best youre gonna do  mike this is not good  youve been swimming away from bad guys a little too often these days  i know  im not saying youre not popular  but youre a guy whos had a lot of disagreements over the years   you cant even trust your buddies  its nothing we cant handle  michael you really need stitches  im fine the cuts are shallow  i know i made them  you know i never liked that harlan  do you remember i told you  you told me i was going to get him killed  no you misunderstood thats not what i meant  it doesnt matter the point is  you three need to stick together   are you gonna be all right  yes im going home tonight  the newspapers are already saying that the land will be returned  my father will be released from prison soon  thats good im glad  sorry about harlan he seemed so nice  like a good man  he was a good man once   i didnt mean to bring you to trouble  its not your fault  trouble seems to find me without any help  good luck   how you doing there brother  im fine sam   i could have done this meeting alone  i know  just wanted to get some air  go for a ride with my pal in sunny miami  sunshine you know  what the hell am i gonna do you got a target on your back   theres nobody else protecting you  i dont need a bodyguard  i need an agency  its time for me to get my old job back my real job  we went through this just because folks that burned you are laying off  doesnt change the fact that youre radioactive  government types arent gonna touch you youre still out  then ill find a way to get back in  simple as that  alright  youre buying the mojitos
