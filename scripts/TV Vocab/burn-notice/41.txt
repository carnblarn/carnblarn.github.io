                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  its dangerous to say no to a spy  in a business where motives are questionable  and loyalty is skindeep  declining the wrong request  can earn you a trip to the morgue  so if youre asked to soak in a jacuzzi  by a blackops sociopath  whos paranoid about listening devices  you pick out your favorite trunks and wade in  come on in michael the waters warm  hot hot hot   am i being punished  not at all  i just thought we could use a spot  where we could talk freely about our future together  i like you you know like a friend but  youre cute but dont interrupt  my moods been a bit dodgy since you failed  to steal that file i wanted from the chileans  see i wouldnt say i failed as much as your plan failed  as long as you dont partner me up again  youll get your file soon enough  i wont ive learned the files been destroyed  and i confess my first thought  was to kill you and take my leave  but no we must keep calm and carry on  thanks  i think ive sussed out a way  to get the information that i need  ill leave the details to you this time but the gist is this  youre to steal flight data for every private plane  flying in and out of miami for the next six weeks   what are you doing  me im offering you a job  you do it you get paid money thats all you need to know  listen i dont like prison food  operations that have to do with flight traffic  extremely risky i need to know more before i commit  and i am telling you that simply cannot be  this is another moment of truth michael  do we have a future together or not   double my fee  the price of ignorance  the price of privacy  fair enough  can i get out now  i pushed as hard as i could sam hes not talking  well to be fair guys a scheming psychopath  keeping their cards close to the vest is what they do  you may have to stay in the game longer  to find out what hes holding  i may lose my seat at the table  if i dont come up with six weeks worth of private flight records  we could try the faa the dea  i was thinking the coast guard  oh the navys little sister thats a good choice  how are you gonna get in  oh dont give me that look  they hire exseals all the time for homeland security checkups  you could get one of your buddies to hire you on for a temp gig  you could get in out no questions asked  oh jesus mike but you know the thing about buddies  is that theyre your buddies  you cant make them unwitting accomplices to a felony  do you have an alternative with a lower risk of somebody being killed  sam im really asking  i dont want to do this any more than you do  all right brother ill do it  but im getting an itchy feeling  you sure thats from a moral dilemma  oh thats not nice  dead bolt was cut with a blowtorch  probably didnt break in to steal your blender  hey pal sorry about the mess  larry what the hell are you doing here  well its nice to see you too michael  and sam i also see you  seriously pal we do 20 missions on 3 continents  and this is how you greet me  well that was before you faked your own death  and came back without a soul  ouch little harsh huh  uh you do kill people for money larry  you know last time we said goodbye  i was staring at you through a sniper scope  what made you think i ever wanted to see you again  come on now dont be like that  look i am not here to kill you  he was i saved your life  all right talk  ill explain everything after we get rid of this body  now ive been looking around this place  trying to find something to stuff him in  so we can carry him out without spooking your neighbors  how attached are you to that couch  would you look at that three to the chest  he didnt even get a shot off  i just get better with age  uh mikey thats a santa muerte tattoo  six tears the guys a pro with half a dozen kills  pro thats kind of generous six is a promising start i guess  larry why is a hit man in my apartment  well i think that juan doe here  would have preferred the term sicario  a cartel wants me dead  not exactly so far its only the guy  who runs their cashprocessing center carlos  he sent this fellow and he wants his money back  so he wont have to tell his bosses   you robbed the colombians  two million bucks  they haul in all this wrinkledup street cash  dirty bills they got to be cleaned and sorted somewhere  and then when i heard that these idiots do it all in the same place  you used my name to get close  im a burned spy im here to help  its a pretty good approach damn it  i mean especially with your dossier attached  okay i admit we have a situation  i tried to close the loop  but carlos wasnt there when i hit the place  i killed four guys and he is angry  mike im just gonna say it  theres room for two in that couch  its heavy as it is  always such a softie i love this kid  listen i got the perfect solution  we feed this body to the sharks  and then you and i kill carlos  and i will give you a brandnew identity  thats your solution  for mike to kill a man and go on the run  honestly michael  how do you put up with this guys constant mothering  yes sam that is exactly the plan  and it will work  michael i have a whole new network  protection guns ids  and you will be safe under my wing  you really think im gonna be your partner  im gonna give you 24 hours  to change your mind and get in touch  after that i got to think about my own liability  someone has to clean this up  youre larry garber now  yeah with the kind of money i make  you cant just leave it laying around the house  you want to invest you need an identity  and there was this shoe salesman up in buffalo  and he was kind enough  to fall on a knife and give me his  think about it  call me  that guy sucks   hey fi  hey fi  michael when you asked if you could come over  you did not mention sam  its nothing i havent seen before  i didnt want to get into details on the phone  i have a body in the trunk of my car and larrys back  oh and a cartel wants to kill mike  if you can take larrys word for it   which you know we cant  damn it michael  the last time he was here  you should have pulled the trigger  no more bodies until we figure out what im up against  and we find a place to store the one weve got  fine you can use my neighbors apartment  the place is tented for termites theyre fumigating next week  preserving a corpse is not a frequent job requirement for a spy  but if you must stashing a body is a lot like storing high explosives  air water and heat are the enemy  his name is justino valverde  not an organ donor in case you were feeling guilty  so far nobodys called him  fi and i can track down where he lives and check it out  probably not a good idea for you to show your face around cartel central  right ill lay low and dig in to his phone  i guess i got to go by and alert my mom  nate too  you forgot your brother was coming into town didnt you  meet mrs nate westen   nate youre married  yep  me and ruth pulled the trigger tuesday in vegas  welcome to the family new bro  your brother is so amazing  we met last month at my blackjack table  and six decks with him and i was done  surprise right they just arrived just a little while ago  and i it still hasnt sunk in  this is great  wow   to nate and ruby ruth  ruth  nate   god shes incredible right  she is yeah   i have a problem  yeah well theres a shocker  i need you to stay here and watch mom  are you kidding me no  no dude this is like my honeymoon bro  you want me to subject ruth to that right away  i can appreciate that but i really  need you to keep an eye out larrys in town  dead larry the assassin  take this dont tell mom shell freak out  im freaking out  all right fine but you got to check in often  thank you i mean that  you really know how to kill a buzz bro  i have to go but congratulations  the two of you wow  michael dont you da  so my cop buddy says this house has  gotten some noise complaints recently  bunch of young guys probably sicarios waiting around between hits  its sort of like a frat house for cartel soldiers  it looks like they installed the security cameras themselves  coax coming from the inside  there must be more in the house  so the bosses can keep an eye on these guys  and somebody forgot to pay the gardener  lucky us  sometimes the leastsecure parts of a security system  are the security cameras themselves  if leaves obstruct the lens  because the landscaping hasnt been maintained  you can approach from a blind spot  and if you get close enough borrowing the video feed  is as easy as stealing payperview  this week on casa de sicario  the killers sleep late and eat cereal for lunch  hey you okay with the first shift here  i have to go exploit a friend  in the name of an unsanctioned national security operation  and i dont want to be late  helping michael with gilroy have fun  yeah define fun  hey sam  that gilroy bastard better be worth it  you already got the stuff from the coast guard  yeah and i feel like crap about it  im pimping my seal ink down here mike  its disgusting no more favors like this  and if your job goes sideways and blows back on my friend  you and me were gonna have some problems pal  justinos phones a dry well brandnew  his only calls were his grandma and a pizza place  you got here just in time  were meeting a mysterious new character  some kind of boss type  showed up about five minutes ago  i dont like him so far  hes kind of a sourpuss  so  just met nates wife  theres a mrs nate westen  blackjack dealer he just met  the whole thing seems pretty well thought out  well i say good for nate good for him  you know life is short you got to grab it by the  i should take this looks like boss mans texting the dead guy  is it coded  kind of its in spanish  look if it was in russian or farsi i  whats taking so long  okay mystery solved  i guess this is the guy who wants you dead  ooh he called him a pendejo  thats like idiot but ruder  it says to hurry up with you  get over to finish the job at the hotel victor  sounds like larry forgot to mention  im not the only target  you look upset  so whos carlos gunning for here  hes my front man  i hired a guy to drop your name  youd have done the same thing  hes a disposable parttime hustler  youre working with an amateur  amateur criminal  professionally hes a magician like for kids parties  great card tricks great smile  jack fleetwood  real names yablonski not too bright  sleeps with the manager here so he stays for free  im surprised hes still breathing  well i was gonna take care of him later  ah tu aires  tu airs eries  oh you have lived in miami for how long  hes calling him a pen  its a sort of like idiot but ruder  and hes saying he is sending some more guys over  to clean things up  oh look natures taking its course we can just relax  relax you think i want a police investigation into this  my name is attached  i told you i could give you a new name michael  why bother saving some poor schmuck  coming nina  nina nina nina  whoa michael hey whats going on  im michael  okay two michaels whats going on  well explain later i just need you to get dressed right now  why  a colombian drug cartel wants you dead  theyre sending a couple of guys over to kill you  what is this about those latin guys you had me talk to  didnt i just say ill explain later   theyre here  no no no no no   no more bodies  you got a better idea  does this room have a pool view  yeah  i said a better idea   just climb over there  its safe just hit the mattress  if you stay on this floor they will hunt you down and kill you  the key to surviving a fall into shallow water  is safely displacing your bodys mass  a flat surface floating on top  can help absorb and distribute your weight evenly  miss the target  and you may as well be jumping right onto concrete  ohh i think i broke my foot  crazy huh  why would you bring him here  i want that nut job out of my house  its not like he didnt already know your address  why would that make me feel better  if i let him out of my sight  thats when he starts killing everyone  i really think uh it would be better  if i kept this elevated on the bed  forget it houdini  that is a hungarian goosedown duvet  listen michael i  i apologize about all this cartel stuff  but can you help me out cause im really confused  jack you and i have a problem  this guy carlos you talked to  he thinks we robbed him of 2 million  and killed four of his friends  hmm  so we need to convince him that somebody else did it  preferably somebody whos already dead  so the body count doesnt go any higher  we need to convince carlos this was an inside job  his own sicario justino valverde robbed him  and this is something youre hopefully really good at  we zero out justinos bank account  buy some conflicting airline tickets some clothes  itll look like this guy stole carlos money  and is about to skip town with the cash  got it   he didnt  no  its like an illusion  im starting to regret saving his life  well he knows too much now  you cant have the cartel find him  w  whats going on  you guys making some kind of decision  orchestrating a fake sighting  isnt a job that calls for subtlety  its not enough to dress an imposter in the right clothes  am i doing all right  oh you are doing just fine justino  youre kinky  and i like it  you need to make grand gestures  and attract attention to colorful details  justino here thinks that his tattoo is sexy  i think its scary whos right  its santa muerte  do it right  and eyewitnesses will be lining up  to swear they saw a dead man buying drinks  drinks are on you my friend  this round is on justino  he just inherited a fortune  you need to get out of town  go vacation in the keys  go now and burn the clothes  every class of criminal has their own set of fears  usually the bogeyman lives in the mirror  thieves triplelock their doors  embezzlers check their bank accounts obsessively  and cartel soldiers get the hell out of any car  that wont start right away  carlos im michael westen good to meet you  what the hell  you think i have your money thats all the money i have  you better kill me now  you know youre not the first person to tell me that today  you think you can rob me huh  me  i didnt rob you carlos  your boy justino did  i never even heard of you  until i got wind some cartel lackey wanted me dead  what  no this punk jack he told me  he told you what justino said to tell you  justino would never betray me  really  i think you might have a little too much faith  in the bond you share with a mass murderer  i got a call carlos  your boy justino was spotted at the iguana bar  down on south beach five hours ago  since then nothing  hes probably gonna blow town  son of a bitch  if this dont check out  what are you gonna do you gonna kill me  find him carlos do it fast do it alone  trust the wrong sicario again  and the next time your car doesnt start  you might not be missing a spark plug  how do you know that you dont want to live there  youve never even been to vegas  you have to at least give it a chance  i am not some old woman  that you can pack away into a retirement village  you do not get to tell me where to live  mom who said anything about a retirement village  i just want you close by  someplace where spies and killers  arent crawling out of the woodwork every other week  someplace safe  you know vegas is amazing  the weather is amazing  someday youre gonna have grandkids there  dont you think living near them would just be  amazing  are you gonna smoke that in here  you want mom to move to vegas  i want you on my side on this  tell her its too dangerous here  shell listen  she never listens to me  can you at least try  give her a minute to cool down  maybe give her a day  is this your card 4 of spades  still no  hey mike  mike you better look at this  we have got hundreds  of individually logged flights here  tail numbers nav points clearance codes  everything you need to create mayhem in the sky for a month  and chuck finley didnt get this stuff sam axe did  thats not even the point  we shouldnt be giving this stuff to gilroy  is this your card  oh for gods sa man its the 3 of clubs  okay thats not fi cause she went out for food like five minutes ago  hey  got to hand it to you kid i had my doubts  what are you talking about  well your plan it worked  ive been following carlos all day long  come here take a look at this  there hasnt been anything this good on at 1000 long time  wow look at him trashing that place  justinos no that couch my friend  larry   come on enough  youre not killing him  you dont get it do you your plan worked  its time to dump justino and this chucklehead  on carlos front stoop and walk away   put the knife down larry  or what  your trigger finger has rusted off  what the hell was that  hey he warned you  and look theres not gonna be any more blood  just as soon as your hand stops dripping  i am not talking to you boy scout  this is my show larry and i need him alive  hes gonna point carlos to the money you stole  you think im giving up 2 million bucks now  yeah i do  the key to fake surveillance is delivering real boredom  if someone suffers for the information youre feeding them  theyre much more likely to belive it  can i get one of them chips man  whats no in spanish its still no right  you didnt tell me we were gonna be here all day  im hungry  why dont you just go snatch his ass  yeah howd that work out for you last time genius  i told you jacks too protected  hes had guys watching him  ever since your boys missed him at the hotel  i dont care we cant just sit around here all day  we got to act  showtime buddy  just read the script exactly the way i wrote it  listen listen  whats up tino  hes talking to justino  the boat slip on grove isle yeah 500s good  i can be there should i bring a bag  maricon is talking about his cut  i mean if you got it all with you  you got to let me take a look at the whole pile  i mean i bet it barely fits in the trunk  oh thats beautiful amigo  all right  when justino shows up at his meeting  hes gonna be so dead  fi were on  if youve been procrastinating you cant anymore  we got the money in the trunk just waiting on justino  tell michael the next time he asks me for a favor  im gonna ask him what it is before i say yes  fiona dont shoot i let myself in  what the hell are you doing here  just gonna go out on a limb  and guess youve never dressed a corpse before  so im here to help   im not interested in  oh come on  let me put it another way  if this job goes south because you screwed up  everybody is gonna end up  very sad  here hand me that shirt  its a hell of a lot easier when you stitch em in  your mother must be so proud  youre gonna pretend that we have nothing in common huh  we both have certain capacities and certain appetites  and that is how we connect with michael  you dont know the first thing about michael  sometimes youre just what he needs  and then sometimes he pushes you away  uh do those have cucumber in them   im allergic  oh  well i have cold cuts in the fridge  no i thought i told you  im trying to stay away from protein  mom um id like to talk about vegas again  oh what about what i want  does that matter in this discussion  i think what nates trying to say  is you might feel better  we all might feel better maybe if you were someplace safer  like 3000 miles away safer  oh look cucumber salad  im sorry that im late and that i cant stay  michael can i talk to you for a minute  i just had a visit from your old pal larry  okay dont believe everything he says  he said thatd together for three years  thats true  but the government thought we were a good team  after all you saw him do  i dont know how you can stay in the same room with him  i cant be with you right now  you need help with carlos you can ask sam  mikey to celebrate my genius  i was going blind  futzing with all that flight data on my laptop  so i went old school  and i figured out which flight gilroys after  all right every page is a flight plan  this is every flight today  its like pickup sticks its all crisscross  its a big cluster and every day is exactly like that  except one day the 22nd  somebody needs a wide berth  yeah you get that when its mandated by the government  this is some kind of serious black flight mike  and ill bet you dollars to doughnuts  this is what gilroy is interested in  and this is all hes gonna get  sam you probably right about which flight hes after  but he asked for all of it every flight  you think you get to make this call alone  im on the line here my friend is on the line  every person on every one of those planes is on the line  you said it yourself hes only after one flight  right but what is to stop him  from selling the rest to the highest bidder  we wont let that happen  youre right we wont  you want this data mike  youre gonna have to steal it yourself  cause im not gonna give it to you  and hey if that makes me the boy scout  that you and your friend larry think i am   man im okay with that  sam  no i am not gonna help you anymore  until you get your head out of your ass   sam  hey you want backup  at your meeting with carlos call fi  sam   he wont look so peaceful when im done with him  what do you think youre doing  im gonna go pull his fingers off  i got to talk to this guy  see if the rest of my crew was in on this  how the hell did you get put in charge of anything  were not getting within  you dont know what kind of backup he has  what hell is that doing in my trunk  when we know hes alone well go down there and collect your money  then you can do whatever you want to his fingers  hold on hold on no no no no  he robbed me okay  he killed my men give it to me  i get the honors  dont miss  you see what you get pendejo  its all here  i guess i got to let you off the hook huh  so were good  were great  large amounts of cash present a huge temptation  oye  to steal to kill for to counterfeit  theres no security strip no thread  are you trying to pull something huh  were you in on this  that doesnt make any sense  you run a cashprocessing center  why would i shove monopoly money in your face  dont be stupid put the gun away  i aint got to let you call me stupid no more  justino must have been trying to screw his partner over  this is not my fault  its your fault i cant have him alive  i cant ask him where he hid the real money  i can find the money and you know it  you shoot me its gone forever  you got one day to come up with my cash  you put it in the trunk of a car  you park it by the airport you let me know  you do that i take off the hit  if not  cabron  this is fi leave a message  fi larry swapped the money  i dont know where he is or what hes doing  call me back  youve reached the voicemail for sam axe  sam  larry what the hell were you thinking  michael im sorry youre upset  i pulled that lastminute switcheroo  for your own good okay  we should get together i need to talk  you meet at my loft in one hour  and if youre not there if you try to run  i will find you and i will kill you  sorry  couldnt walk away from 2 million bucks  not gonna happen  i need that money  ill give you half of it if you do this my way  kill carlos  my head is on the chopping block larry  you dont think ill end you to save myself  oh i know you would  and that is what i love about you kid  but im not the guy who sent people to end your life  all you have to do is kill him  youre at a fork in the road i know you  this is not a tough call  killing carlos does not solve my problem  my name its in the air  ill give you a new one ill protect you  youre a shoe salesman from buffalo  i have connections i have guns  and i also have what you need most  the will  the will to act on our instincts  to get what we want  and what i want is to work with you again  ill cut the head off the whole cartel  if thats what it takes  but you know whats sad  i dont see anyone else stepping up to bail you out  its doorde time kid  whats it gonna be  after a career spent doing bad things for good reasons  its hard to say exactly where you draw the line  you might not know exactly  until someone asks  ill kill carlos you take care of the rest  hey mike open up its nate  there you are  not a great time  yeah  whatever you got me watching out for our mom  you wont even answer my calls   what  what do you mean what  i wanted to see if there was anything else i could do  to help with this larry thing  i left you like three messages  turning an asset is a multistep process  you back them into a corner you pile on stress  you create tension with the people they trust  and if you can cut them off from good influences  so youre the only voice in their ear  damn it  theyre much more likely to listen   did larry  he knows i check for bugs  he switched out my sim card  used call forwarding isolated me  its a formula that works so well  it even works on spies who ought to know better  you really thought no one was answering your calls  jesus bro dads dead  youre not in afghanistan anymore  i mean when are you gonna learn  there are people you can trust  ah you ever have one of these cuban coffees  cortaditos fun to drink fun to say  cortaditos  you know ive been thinking  if were going to do this i want to be thorough  leave no trace leave no teeth  ooh thats good  thats a bumper sticker i love that  forget shooting carlos  were gonna blow up his cash room  well take the whole building down  with carlos in it  if it looks enough like a car bomb  the cops will think rival dealers did it  no i get it i just  im not sure i buy it  a new violent plan at the last minute  what happened to saint michael  people dont change overnight  well i havent  thats why im pushing it to 300  it will give me time to clear out  as many tenants as possible  oh theres the old softie  im kidding im impressed im impressed  this is a big step forward  are we in business or not  cause if we are i want my money fast  were gonna have to run  relax relax i can get it really quick  my bags are already packed   dont be late larry  michael westen back in action  i wouldnt miss it  yeah  ive said im sorry before right   im not sure  i need help  my plan with carlos fell apart and im scrambling  i need to find out where larry stashed his money  well if i were him i would keep it close  but i would want it someplace where you would look guilty  if he had to bag out on the job  can you meet me at the loft  sam were gonna celebrate your genius  my punching bag  you know he actually laughed  when he said my bags are packed  2 million its all there  whats next  i need to apologize  i should have listened to both of you  its all right buddy  you were marked for death it got to you  i know i let larry get too close  you let him crawl inside your head and make a nest  theres a part of me  this part thats like him  but its just a part  and it gets smaller the longer im with you  well tell me youre done with him forever  i am i want him gone  how can i help  i need you to help me make a very special bomb  yeah how did you decide on the binary liquids  theyre stable easy to smuggle as separates  exotic enough so the cops wont know what theyre looking at  its beautiful kid that is just beautiful  you know what we are gonna have so much fun  i dont think we will  i dropped off carlos money at the airport this morning  he called off the hit  me and carlos were straight well at least were gonna be  you shouldnt have done that kid  that is not your money to give away  whats with the gun larry  i let you live and now youre gonna feed me to the sharks  you betrayed me you know i will  you know what i dont have to  im just gonna leave you here  youre gonna be a smoldering corpse  what are you talking about theres no bomb larry  oh  you framed him right  nice and the binary liquid  uh counterfeiting ink  the laptop is just full of graphics  and what was carlos doing with a bunch of scans of 20 bills  probably printing about 2 million worth of fake bills  in this dumpster  you know what i dont get you kid  you dont think his bosses will have him killed in prison  carlos made a choice  he chose to work for the cartel  i make my own choices  i dont kill anyone unless i have to  yeah well we are different that way  youre not gonna kill me larry  not when the cops are coming to talk to larry garber  the man who called in a report that he saw men with guns  a dumpster filled with fake cash  having an identity has its drawbacks huh larry  you forget who youre dealing with here  i faked my own death once  sure but what about larry garbers investments  and all of his bank accounts  theyll sit on that money and theyll wait for you  you shoot me  and all that money is as good as gone  youre at a fork in the road  go broke and go to jail  or run from the cartel and live to fight another day  i know you man  this isnt even a tough call  there will be another day michael  let me do you a favor  ill take this and hide it for you  youre a hero larry larry garber  officer  officer please thank you for coming  thank you  this way right over here in the trunk  llisten i cant thank you enough  youve been so cool about this  jack remember youre no longer jack fleetwood  youre jack yablonski again forever  yeah im psyched about that  be safe man  and jack seriously if you ever come back to miami  or if i ever hear the name fleetwood again  i will kill you myself  okay have a safe trip  wish we didnt have to take off so soon  it was wonderful having you  ruth wish you could stay longer  we do too but you know work  one more day she was gonna file for an annulment  you owe me bro  you drive safe bye ruth  bye  so you sorry im not leaving with them  mom i did not say i wanted you to leave  i said if you wanted to live someplace safer  closer to them id understand  well im happy for nate  its time that he settled down and built a life  but i have mine  its here  with you  and sam and fiona  plus i cant stand that woman  weighing operational risk is tricky  when your life is on one side of the scale  withholding flightplan data may put your life in danger  but you try to remember that if you jeopardized thousands of innocent lives  to save your own you wouldnt want to live with yourself anyway  youre a tad overdressed for the jacuzzi dont you think  is this your card  its blatantly not six weeks of flight plans  just the one that you want  chile to poland  tail number 4wxa803  registered to a faceless corporation in santiago  whats so special about the plane  what happened to the price of privacy  well you hired an operative not a child  i need to know whats going to poland  right  well i suppose its only natural to be curious  ill tell you  its a weaponized plague and a vaccine to match  and theyre worth a bloody lot of money   that wasnt so hard was it  youre in then  gilroy i think you and i have a bright future together  so learn anything  only that hes a damn good liar  tried to sell me some line about a bioweapon  but it took him a little too long to come up with it  back to square one then  guess youre gonna have to keep doing some digging  im gonna need some help sam  imagine that
