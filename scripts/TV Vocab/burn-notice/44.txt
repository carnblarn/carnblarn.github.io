in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  previously on burn notice  i want you people out of my life  tell me michael all your old enemies from your spy days   where do you think theyve been  youve been under our protection  you want out  theres the door  you have no idea what hell will rain down  if we stop watching out for you  your shades got delivered to the loft along with this  come on in michael the waters warm  youre to steal flight data for every private plane  flying in and out of miami for the next six weeks  you get that when its mandated by the government  this is some kind of serious black flight mike  you found out whats on that flight  not what its who  whos on the flight  his name is simon paid me 10 million  turns out his plan was to shoot me come after you  did i mention im attached to an explosive device  sam mike what the hell is going on over there  sam gilroys dead  you know that prisoner he was helping escape  dont tell me  hes out sam hes free  the whole reason we were getting involved here mike  was so he didnt  no need to remind me  his names simon thats all i know  right now i just need to get clear of the cops  mike its not just the cops the fbi is involved now  homeland securitys on alert  pretty soon its gonna be the irs the forest service  and the food and drug administration  are gonna be looking for you  im headed into the canal streets  ill do my best to stay clear  see if you can do a little recon for me  you got it brother  holy crapoly  spies are in the lawbreaking business  call it espionage covert ops whatever you like  when you get right down to it  youre a criminal working for a good cause  when your job involves daily lawbreaking  chances are youre going to find yourself  on the wrong end of a manhunt at some point  im at the corner of canal and 155th street  suspect is on foot  need backup asap copy  i dont want to hurt you just stop ugh  just stop  its hard to get used to the idea that doing the right thing  can mean being public enemy number one  stop right now put your hands on your head now  the good news is youre usually too busy trying to survive  to get upset  usually the best thing is to get away  deal with the situation  and hope people are in a forgiving mood  commuter parking lots are great for fugitives  you can get some sleep while your pursuers lose momentum  to exhaustion and shift changes  its also onestop shopping for dry clothes or a new phone  sam its me  youve reached sam axes fugitiveassistance service  sam speaking how was your night  not bad under the circumstances  thats a silver lining i suppose  cause im looking at the dark cloud  your place is crawling with surveillance  you got two teams drinking conveniencestore coffee  i guess they saw your car was gone  and decided to wait up all night long to surprise you  i guess im not going back to my place then  listen we got to get simon  the kind of guy who escapes from a black flight  is not the kind of guy you want mixed in with the general public  yeah im with you  so i called fi suggested we rally and make a plan  called your ma too  meet at the emergency spot  no  im thinking we should meet at the emergency emergency spot  see you there  madeline westen  yes  my name is agent callahan im with the fbi  we need to talk to you about your son michael  so were you um were you planning a trip  oh no no im just  going out of town for a while you know  no no ii dont know  is the answer no you werent planning a trip  or yes you  getting out of town  im going on a daytrip  and do you usually bring a pumpaction shotgun with you  on a daytrip  cant be too careful these days  maam ill get right to the point  your son is in a lot of trouble  and i just want to bring him in and get the facts  and until then he is in an enormous amount of danger  so please  help me help him  now i assume from your daytrip bag here  that you have a way of reaching him  id like you to call him  and set up a meeting  now  spies love places people tend to avoid   sewage plants toxic dumps condemned motels  all places you can put emergency supplies  and not worry about whether theyll be there  when you need them  well we got enough firepower for an army  unfortunately were a little light on snacks  there was no place for a fridge  so we got no yogurt and we got no beer  i think were gonna be all right sam  mike this is the emergency emergency phone  the only person who knows this number aside  from the three of us is your ma  hello  michael iits me  uh theres been a change of plans  i want you to come home right now  i need to talk to you mom is something   good ill see you soon then  she said to come home right now  its what she used to say when my dad was on a bender  and she wanted me to stay away from the house  you think that she   the fbi went everywhere else  oh mike theyre gonna come at her hard  she knows the cars we drive our contacts  i mean shes good but shes not gonna be able to hold out forever  i have faith in her shell be fine  so listen mike um  me and fi want to talk to you  about this whole business with simon  neither of us liked you getting involved with gilroy  in the beginning  i didnt have a choice i had to   look mike i know you did what you had to do  but we got a situation here  were with you but no more lonewolf crap  we got to know that youre with us  im with you  good all right were gonna do it right this time  were gonna be careful were gonna watch each others backs  combat knives for everyone just in case  thanks  im sorry guys  was that an apology  okay we got to keep moving here stay ahead of simon  any ideas  he killed gilroy with explosives  i assume gilroy didnt make the bomb that killed him  so simons got to have an explosives expert in miami fi  yeah ill track down the supplier  i have the rest of my stuff on gilroy in the charger  its parked in coral gables  keep your head down mikey  a good operative doesnt believe in coincidences  its true of course that food stands catch fire  from time to time  its even possible that one might catch fire  at the same time you happen to be looking for a violent fugitive  but its sure not likely  simon any of it look familiar  not really  these little incidents  youll be interested to know  are all things youre accused of doing   the very things that earned you your burn notice  chechnya 2002  you read your file didnt you   it was 54 actually  but i guess some journalist got lazy  i didnt do that  i didnt do any of these things  i know that i did  all of it  you  well not the boring parts  but the greatest hits  these were mine  were leaving simon  youre getting back on an airplane lets go  no we wont be doing that  were gonna have a conversation  a few tons of explosives in a hotel in miami beach  theres the detonator  fuelandfertilizer mixture  behave or that screen gets a lot more exciting  gun down phone on the counter  now  thank you  we need to have a good working relationship  you see youre gonna help me with something  why would i want to help you  the powers that be decided that i was uncontrollable  they dumped me in a hole  they transferred my file to you  gave you a fearsome reputation   my reputation  do you want it  i want my life back  fine  its yours take it  i will  to do that we need  you know him as management  youre gonna bring him to miami for me  you want me to bring you management  he ruined my life  were not on good terms  he wants you back in the fold  hell come when you call  youll have to convince him or  booom  ive been watching your career in miami  just think of me as one of those people you help in your spare time   a desperate fella with a problem  as a spy you want to work with people with clear alliances  the biggest monster in the world  becomes pretty predictable on a government payroll  your worst nightmare is a lone crazy person  red phosphorous under the cooktop  theyll be putting that out for days  simon just so were clear   you need me to get in touch with management  yeah i want you to bring him  to the government building at 703 grand avenue  at 600 pm  tell him you want a new identity  tell him  tell him you want a shetland pony  i dont care just get him there  i can try but i need to go back to my loft to do it  well lets take a ride then  wait wait  i dont like waiting  the van  surveillance they went around the block three times  they probably picked me up on one of the traffic cams  lets kill him and be done with it  listen this is an opportunity  i need to find out what kind of surveillance  is on me at the loft  i have to talk to the guy  we have a busy day michael  do you have any idea how much heat there is on me right now  we rush this were dead  stay here keep an eye on the cops  hey can i talk to you for a sec  sorry man if youre looking  to buy something off the truck i cant do it  what the hell are you doing  you scream you die do you want to live  keep your mouth shut and run as fast as you can that way  can i borrow your phone  go  sam hello  sam its me i dont have a lot of time simon found me  ah jesus mike  he wants me to get management to miami  management  long story  when you were at my loft did you see a way in  no they got it surrounded mike   you know the marina the container yard  best bet is the river  you could go up a couple hundred yards and swim  but are you sure you want to do that  if i dont simons gonna blow up a hotel  oh great any idea which one  thatd be too easy  you and fi got to find that bomb  well shes twisting arms and calling in favors  so were doing what we can  but mike dont let simon out of your sight okay  give us some time to get to a phone  we find the bomb you take this guy out  ill do my best sam  there you are  i was beginning to think  you didnt understand our arrangement  i got what i needed  two fbi teams are watching my place but i know a way in  and the surveillance i took care of him  michael didnt think you had it in you  so that was a signal then  you warned him off  what are you talking about he said hes   dont play games with me  im not  how much do you know  about your sons situation mrs westen  i prefer to give him his privacy  do you know what he does  he kills people  yeah  look at that  i have to get something from the kitchen  no no i want you to sit down  and i want you to look at that  that was just three years ago in jordan   all of them maimed  he didnt do this  oh come on what you think hes gonna tell his mother  you think hes gonna say  sorry mom i blew up a bus today  people get burned for a reason mrs westen  please where were you going to meet your son  the sawgrass mills mall  the food court  thank you  sam so thats our hotel bombers house  it better be or i know a gun dealer  whos gonna be choking on my high heel  looks like hes home  from what i hear he doesnt get out much  and hes got more guns in there than a little african country  probably shouldnt knock on the front door then  fi how does this baby handle  when entering a possible combat situation  you want the element of surprise on your side  its why special forces like to rappel down from helicopters  of course if you dont have a helicopter  you may have to improvise  hi honey im home  unhunh  hands up  i aint got anything else to tell you man  i came down from rhode island  picked up a couple of jobs doing demolitions   a little side work for a biker gang  you are operating on my turf  that biker gang  they told me how to find you  you see keith if i ask them  to drag you back to rhode island behind their harleys  they would just so that i would owe them a favor capiche  yeah  so answer my questions about this little hotel bomb  or take your chances with the bikers  i just did what the guy said  he gave me the specs i made the device  i put it in a basement at the epic hotel  okay so you just put a bomb in a hotel just like that  like washing your car  i was gonna turn the job down  but this guys nuts  hes gradea psycho you would like him  this device  hows it set up  its airtight  its got a timer and a remote  epic hotel we better get down there  you sit tight  the cops will be here any minute  its insulting really  they give you my file   youd think they could set you up in a nicer neighborhood  it grows on you  my place  just across the canal around the bridge  it looks clear shall we  there is no we  the fbis all over my place  i think we can handle a few guys in suits  im swimming across the canal scaling a back wall  and coming in through the roof  im not sure i can do that alone without being seen  the two of us  we dont stand a chance  you got 10 minutes hows that sound  sounds like a joke  well what can i say im hilarious  go  agent hear that  i think someones on the roof  radio the boys wed better check it out  work in intelligence long enough  and you hang on to phone numbers  no matter who your enemy is  theres a chance youll need him tomorrow  churchill and stalin werent chummy in 1941  but once the nazis marched on moscow  they got past their differences  operator answering service  this is michael westen i need to speak to management  one moment please  management michael westen  so  changed your mind  im calling about a former employee of yours  simon  how do you know about simon  i know about simon  because he escaped from whatever hole you put him in  and now he wants your head  he wants me to get you  to a government building on grand ave by 600 pm  keep him where he is ill get a team to you  hes not that stupid  right now all we have  is he thinks im willing to hand you over  if it means clearing my name  ah  and you have a proposal  you come just like he wants you bring a team  and you take him down when he comes after you  fine  but know this  youre my insurance  if this goes wrong  i wouldnt want to be you or anyone who knows you  i figured  got to go talk to you later  when a trained team is advancing on your position  sneaking away is usually impossible  your best bet is to give them something else to worry about  and  i was getting itchy  i talked to our mutual friend  its set were meeting at 600  very good  michael i know this makes you unhappy  but that old man has it coming  just think of me as an instrument of justice  yeah ill try to wrap my head around that  we should move now  oh  take a right up here  if we cut through the warehouse district  we can lose them in the alleys  thanks i like this route just fine  listen to me theyre gaining on us  if they catch us theyre gonna cut us off at the causeway  or not  whoo  you pull something like that again and ill end this now  aah aah  will you really  you want to run around miami  playing which hotels gonna blow up after im dead  see if i was you id just go ahead and do it  but then i like a hotel blowing up every once in a while  whats it gonna be  just drive  any fatalities  okay thanks  sawgrass mills mall huh  mmhmm  well we went up there nothing  you know mrs westen at this point  i could charge you with aiding and abetting a felon  nothing there probably just a senior moment  you know sometimes i put my phone in the freezer  enough your son just caused a major accident on river road  i dont know anything  people were injured my people  these are men with families  and youre sitting there and letting it happen  got some stuff from the garage   modified shotgun rounds some listening devices  bombmaking components  so what do you have to say about this  those are mine  whoa whoa before you continue  let me be perfectly clear mrs westen  you are now confessing to federal crimes   crimes your son committed  now that may seem very noble right now  but believe me after youre in a federal prison  for a few years you will feel very different  look believe it or not im trying to help you  i want to get michael in one piece  those men out there the ones he hurt   they dont care anymore  what does that mean  it means they will shoot first and ask questions later  ha its funny  you never really know a car  until you drive it through a wall  this little baby did good  hey keep it out front here will you  just got a quick errand thank you sir  well our bomber says its over here  wow  that guy does not mess around  right up against a loadbearing wall  liquid nitrogen isnt available at the corner store  but it is a standard part of a bombmakers workshop  its also useful for diffusing explosives  on a wellmade bomb you can forget about cutting wires  any decent bombmaker will make sure  that the important wires are impossible to reach  well fi its been real  yes it has  freeze the detonator though  and you can usually remove it safely  of course usually is not a word you want to hear  when youre working with explosives  i heard a beep was that a beep  get rid of it get it behind something  okay false alarm  were good  oh nice lets go  ahh smell that sea air  you miss that when youre locked in a secret prison  its the little things  time to get out  get out  youre planning to snatch a guy whos bringing an armed team  we should be scouting the site  ive hired my own team  im gonna put them in place now in fact  thank you for your offer ill be fine  you just be at the government building with management   i said get out  simon this doesnt make any sense  you keep me with you we can do this right  ah you dont think i know what youre doing  you want to keep me here so you can contact your friends  and try to find a way out of this  not gonna happen  you dont want to do this  fine walk away  shoot me  we dont have to do this my way  my way however is the only way  that doesnt involve the deaths of thousands of people  your call  ill see you at 600  dont look so glum michael  remember if this goes right everybody wins  call your friends  here  ill see you soon  sam  jesus mikey there you are ive been calling and calling  what happened  well it was a little messy but we dealt with the bomb  were clear  yeah were a lot of things sam  but clear isnt one of them  thank you  we just got some more news  there was an explosion in a hotel in miami beach  and you think michael did that  youre damn right i think it was michael  why would he want to do that  you tell me why your son would want to blow up a hotel  he would never do that he would never do that he did  look at the file  you saw it already everythings there  its documented  and these are all lies  i saw it with my own eyes  i saw your son attack a police officer mrs westen  he nearly killed the man  your son shot at me he tried to kill me  you live in a fantasy world lady  you have no idea who your own son really is  i know this   if michael wanted to kill you  youd be dead  i know exactly who my son is  now back off  last chance mrs westen  do you really want to pay for your sons mistakes  he paid for mine  you are under arrest  all right get up put your hands behind your back  up now  thats the government building  thats where simon wants management  its pretty open down there which means you got two teams  shooting it out in traffic  perfect  we got the bomb hes lost his leverage  we should shoot the bastard  yeah if he shows himself  thats exactly what we should do  all righty then its that kind of thing  yeah its definitely that kind of thing  i need to go meet management at his landing site  youre going in alone unarmed  management wants to do it his way fi  he wants his team to do all the shooting  im just there to make sure simon shows up  do you have any idea where simon is  probably set up a few miles away in an armored truck  i mean thats what i would do  well well back you up the best we can  thank you  to be a spy you need physical fitness  a facility with languages  a tolerance for exotic foods  and the bugs that come with them  but ultimately theres no greater qualification  than the ability to look someone who ruined your life  in the eye  and say lets work together  right on time  when it comes to simon i dont take chances where is he  im assuming hes planning on grabbing you down on the street  about that lets be clear about one thing before this begins  i might look like a nice old man  but i assure you michael im not  ill remember that do you have your guys in place  down on the street by the office  theyve identified simons team  theyll grab simon as soon as he shows his face  simons team already locals apparently  theyll be eliminated as soon as the attraction starts  simon paid 10 million to break out of prison  he hired an amateur team  whatever tricks simon has planned down there  we have more than enough firepower to take care of it  how many helipads in the area  helipads just the one  just the one  he knew where you were going to land  guess i was wrong about that everybody wins thing  dont be disappointed  youll get your reputation back  of course youll be dead  better late than never  i guess your new little pet didnt work out so well  time to go you son of a bitch  what the hell happened  uh i dont know  i just came out here and the chopper was on fire  this guys hurt im gonna take him downstairs  i need all units to the roof now  come on mikey answer  sam  mike what happened up there  things didnt go quite as planned  yeah no kidding  look were down on the street south side  can you get down here  im working on it  theres no trick to getting down off a building quickly  gravity will take care of that for you  the challenge is getting down without breaking your neck  mike what the hell is going on  simon got away hes with management  hes wearing a blue security uniform and   there there by the ambulance  you call the fbi you tell them where i am  im taking this truck you make sure they follow me  no we talked about this were in this together  the feds are gonna be all over me  we are going with you  you cant follow me this time fi  i got to do this one on my own  fi  michael dont  let us take care of him  you had your chance i saw how well that went  michael  shooting an unarmed man with the fbi about to arrive  will put a big dent in your future  and you have a big future  i should leave  see you soon  are you kidding me  youre gonna listen to the old man  on that trigger  this all ends  come on  put the gun down  do it now  i will blow your head off put the gun down  oh he owns you now boy  get on your stomachs  its just a matter of time  until youre just like me  just like me  justlikeme  ive been sitting here for hours  yes you have  so you gonna charge me with something  me no  im off the case  what are you talking about  im off the case  wheres my son  honestly i have no idea  we had him in custody for about 20 minutes  and then he was taken away  he was here you had him here  thats right and god only knows what hole hes in now  whats that supposed to mean he just disappeared  pretty much  i mean before i couldve gone through official channels  but once someone is removed from our custody  there is nothing i can do  and that is your choice  you had him and you let somebody take him  you did you let somebody take him  you hit me all you want it wont change a thing  he is gone  you can go  how do i find my son  i have no idea
