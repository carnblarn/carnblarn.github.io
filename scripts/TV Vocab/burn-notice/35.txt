                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line as long as youre burned youre not going anywhere  spies arent much into nightclubs  in a career where hearing loss is a serious operational concern  and crowds of strangers have to be constantly monitored   they just dont seem like much fun  im just saying you live above the club arent you curious  you can hear the music through the floor  sams got beer in the fridge knock yourself out  were just back there  you know its not the same when no ones watching  uh the line to the clubs out there  im here for you  excuse me  excuse me  this is for you  its rejuvenating body lotion  a gift from a friend  i can apply itif youd like  that wont be necessary  whos this friend giving you rejuvenating body lotion  hes not a friend  hes a recruiter  oh strickler  i can apply it if you want  training a covert operative takes years and costs a lot of money  in theory its all for the taxpayers who pay the bills  in practice its worth a lot on the open market  and when somethings that valuable theres always someone trying to sell it  oh you didnt like the lotion  its organic best money can buy  you know im all set with lotion right now  like i told you before im not interested in your money  this isnt about money  did you even look at the lotion  its 40 aloe vera they say its great for burns  want a mimosa  so uh its all about the burn notice with you isnt it  well i might be able to help out with that  hows that with moisturizer  remember that nsa logistics guy who got caught up in the panamanian banking scandal a couple years back  rings a bell  should have ended his career  but he had a second chance because of a conversation he had with the right person on a ski lift in aspen  i know cause i was there  if we were working together id be there for you too  as your mercenary  no im not interested  as a friend  friends do each other favors  listen michael we all know whats at the top of your christmas list  work with me i can deliver that list to santa himself  spies hate dropin visits  any questionable contact has to be reported to superiors  a process that involves hours of paperwork and uncomfortable questions  if youre a questionable contact that gives you some leverage  if you know where a spy operates even a guy running a lowly importexport cover business  diego  you can make someones life miserable  what are you doing here  what i cant just drop by and say hi to my favorite point of contact  i thought it was clear last time we spoke   if anyone from the intelligence community has anything to share ill call you  i know i know i know i need a favor  im already doing you a favor by not calling the police  another favor then  theres a name i need you to check out tom strickler  he offered to help out with this whole burn notice thing  i need you to find out if hes a guy who can make things happen  maybe you should google him  or go find someone who cares  see now you have to care  i let the local homeland security office know that i was dropping by and leaving that document there  ill check in later  you dont even know this strickler  what makes you think he has this kind of clout  well thats what i need to figure out  can we talk about something else  no im cooking at my place  i get to choose the topic of conversation  you seriously think hes gonna wave his magic spy wand and get you back in  its a little more complicated than that fi  well in my experience if something seems too good to be true its best to shoot it just in case  one way or another i need to check him out  if hes half as connected as he claimed i need to know  youre not actually considering his offer  michael the guy is sleazy  fi  dont change the subject i want to know   were you expecting a guest  if you want to stay alive you have to be able to recognize the signs of a breakin  the most skilled operative in the world wont last long if he walks into an ambush carrying a box of cereal  when a target is cornered the best strategy is to flush them into a choke point   where they have two options surrender or be shot  drop it  of course if your target turns out to be  it changes the tactical response somewhat  hey all right  easy easy easy easy  look man im sorry i was just gonna borrow it i swear  yeah you borrowa cup of sugar you dont borrow a gun  im sorry im gonna have to call your parents  you dont understand man i have to   you have to what  look just just let me go man  i will when you answer me  i i have to kill my stepdad     youre gonna have to tell us your moms name at some point unless you plan on living here  i dont recommend it  i can only cook a few things and the airconditionings iffy  tell you what why dont we start with whats going on  look you wouldnt understand  you want to shoot your stepdad  im guessing he did more than make you go to bed early  hes trying to take me and my brother away from my mother and nobodys helping  you know shes done everything she could  i saw her taking gun oil and cleaning stuff out of her car  i figured she had a gun  you thought youd take care of the problem yourself  even if you could reassemble a colt m1911 and fire it what happens after you shoot him  did you have a plan to dispose of the body youre not thinking  fi  ill make you a deal  you tell us who your mom is and well see if we can help you  all right  so mikey were doing domestic disputes now  is that a good idea  i mean isnt this more of like a counselortype thing  it sounds a little more serious  yeah but arent you supposed to be checking out this strickler guy  you got bigger fish to fry  i told the kid i would help  you want to sit this one out you can  no no no i get it  little kid abusive dad  kind of hits home  so ill give you that one  but when the time comes to rescue a bunch of rich women trapped in a brewery you better step up  so shes in there with fiona  yeah the idea was that shed feel more comfortable talking to a woman  im not sure if fi counts mike  i appreciate the offer but theres nothing you can do  the custody hearings in a week  eriks taking the son we had together danny and joey too to punish me for leaving  why do you think hell get custody  cause eriks connected  what does he do  hes a businessman  hes into politics too boards commissions mostly around the port of miami  that all there is to it  well his brother quinns a gangster  smuggling mostly  the only reason erik married me and had danny was  because quinn wanted him to look more respectable  and then a few months after we were married he turned violent  didnt you call the police  yeah a few times  so he he got smarter about how he did things and he stopped leaving marks  but when he started on the kids i left and i have spent every dime i have fighting for custody  and i guess joey tried to help  im sorry i i think that  i think im wasting your time  where can we find him  seriously what can you do that the police cant  youd be surprised  so mikey i asked around  stuffed shirt over there is erik luna  hes on every local political board with an extra chair  hes a big deal down at the docks  i guess he even owns part of this golf club  hes a sorry excuse for a man but hes got a lot of friends  how about that how about that nice shot right that was good  the guy that worries me though hes at the bar gray suit  thats his brother quinn  he built this little empire he does all the heavy lifting  but none of it means anything without eriks pretty face and clean record   so hes a little protective  the guy behind the guy  you got it  mike i dont know this is a tough one  between eriks connections and quinns muscle these guys are damn near untouchable  well have to drive his happy little family apart  you up for it  absolutely  hes smacking his wife and kids around  ill plant a five iron in his freaking skull if itll help  its really okay staying with you  its just so sudden  its more than okay  honest i heard the situation and i insisted  and dont you feel bad all right  youre doing whats necessary for your family  trust me honey ive been there  it just seems so crazy  do you really think they can do anything  for two little boys who are being knocked around by their father   michael would take on the chinese army honey  april  michael and sam checked out erik and his brother  did he and quinn have any issues something they disagreed about something he hid  anything we can use to drive them apart  well there were things but  april if were gonna solve your problem you need to work with us  okay erik has a side business and when i found out he was furious  he said hed kill me if i told his brother  good we can use this  there arent any records  if you go to the police hes just gonna   its not for the police  we need to give erik a good reason to skip town and miss the custody hearing  but we need to keep quinn on the sidelines  erik will never know just tell me about the business  well i got to say erik lunas got a nice little scam going  the best that i can tell he takes stuff that gets seized at the docks sells it and pockets the profits  luxury cars mostly  pulls them from holding before they get processed so theres no paper trail  and of course every transaction is anonymous  so if i showed up as an unsatisfied customer   well hed never know the difference  hey joey  uh can i talk to you  sure  uh mike im gonna go put together a name and a game for you  so what are you doing  im turning a cellphone into a listening device so i can keep tabs on your stepdad  how do you learn to do this stuff  a sort of special school  hard to explain  you want to give me a hand  you see that see that wire  i want you to take these and hold it right there  all righty  i i think my mom is starting to get her hopes up  dont worry were not gonna let her down  so you really think you can make this guy run  i know i can  its gonna be my pleasure  when youre undercover you often fight your emotions  if the operation demands that you be a targets best friend   you do it no matter what youre feeling  excuse me sir  but there are times emotions can help sell a cover id  if hitting a guy reinforces your cover  can i help you  you give it all you got  erik luna you are a hard man to find you know that  who the hell are you  i bought a car from you a car which nearly got me killed  is everything okay mr luna  yes im fine  you want to try knocking next time  j just close the door  what are you talking about who are you  the names peter i bought a lot us from you a while back  one day it disappears replaced by a note which informed me that im a dead man  i go home my house is torched  next day im nearly killed in a driveby  all of which made me curious to know where the hell did you get that car from  that was an anonymous sale  youre not even supposed to be here  lets just say i was motivated to find you  that was a mistake  you need to leave  im trying to stay a step ahead of a death squad  i need my money back  even if i wanted to give you that money you think i carry that kind of cash around  didnt anyone ever tell you the customer is always right  youve got one day  youd better watch out because if theyre after me you can be damn sure theyre after you  i got a call from erik this morning  he was yelling  its natural for him to be upset  he has a problem for once he cant run to his big brother  do you really think hes gonna leave town before the custody hearing  oh he will cause if he doesnt im gonna take a claw hammer to his   um yes i think hell leave  its just that on the phone he  he sounded more angry than scared  well thats about to change  is controlling their environment  all the conversations in the world wont have the same impact as turning off the right light at the right time  if you want to kill a streetlight without the mess and inconvenience of breaking into the pole with a cutting torch   you need to access the circuit breaker  connect lines from the breakers to an exposed cellphone wire   and with a quick call you can short the circuits  a similar trick can be used to temporarily disable a car  it doesnt take much to trip a few electronic safety mechanisms and make a vehicle impossible to start  if you want to make sure youre the only one making calls   a 100 cellphone jammer will block all signals in a oneblock radius  you have no idea how painful it was to be under that car and not wire it to explode  if eriks car blows up a week before his custody hearing theyll be a lot of eyes on april  we need him running not bleeding  well technically you can run and bleed  hey gang we got firearms and we got snacks  when you want to create fear its best to keep it simple  the same things people are afraid of as kids  scare them when theyre adults  fear of the dark for example  fear of being alone  and above all fear of the unknown  ill go collect the toys  yeah this is pete  its erik luna  we need to talk  damn right we do  no no no no no that bitch can get the kids one weekend a month a and one holiday a year  thats it i dont c   youre the lawyer just figure it out  if she doesnt sign shell never see those brats  i got enough stuff to deal with just do the paperwork and force it down her throat  do you have my money  no i uh   what did i say was i unclear  hey whoever tried to kill you came after me too  didnt i tell you now stop playing games  i need my money to get out of town  look pete i cant give you the money but i am gonna help you  were gonna help each other  were gonna find out who did this  are you crazy find him how  we take what you know we put it with what i know and we track him down  there is no we  you want to stay you want to die fine im out of here  wait wait no you cant go anywhere  look i had no problem till you showed up  i showed up because you sold me a car that belonged to a psychopath  thats my point okay  we are in this together  well fix this together  we will fix this when we disappear  were not running  no i i got stuff to answer to here i got a life here  youll get your money when we figure out the problem  hey mikey howd it go  hes scared but not ready to run yet  he wants to team up see whos after him  well i guess were gonna have to make him regret that decision  yeah well let him stew for the night  i want to see what diegos doing with the name tom strickler  oh yeah listen by the way i got ahold of my buddy who works for the phone company  hes gonna pull his cherry picker in front of the hangar and take a 2hour lunch  thats all i need  and thats all i need  with todays powerful encryption its usually a waste of time trying to decipher coded communication  tap the data stream of even a lowlevel spy   and youre just going to get incomprehensible garbage  just because its garbage doesnt mean its worthless though  a network analyzer can tell you how much information someones accessing and how encoded it is  if someone starts using heavyduty crypto and changing their security protocol   you know youve touched a nerve  and sometimes thats enough to tell you what you need to know  yeah pete its erik  theyre here theyre outside my office  what are you talking about whos there  i saw some blue car drive by the club like three times  i think its the people that took a shot at me  blue car what kind  i dont know like a like a plymouth or chevy or something  you stay inside you stay there  you dont move until i get there  michael i was just gonna call you  erik attacked april at work  mom wheres joey  joey uh he went out back hes very upset michael  look out into the garage did he take your car  i need to know right now  its gone  what you think joey took the car  lets hope thats all he took  put it down put it down  stop right there and back up back up  this is a mistake  the mistake was letting you help okay  you only made it worse  erik went after your mother because hes scared  what were doing is working you just need to give it a little more time  look we dont have time  joey  before my dad died he made me promise that i would protect my mother and im not gonna let him down  this is not what he meant  you didnt know my father  no but i know that shotgun  you know its just loaded with bird shot  its got a range of about 14 feet  the only damage youre gonna do to erik from here make his ears hurt  and you see that plug right there  that means it can only get off two shots at a time  let go  you see your mom hurt and you want to help i get it  joey but not like this  listen to me  right now erik luna is sitting in that parking lot about to wet himself  do you want to help me put him over the edge  get back in my moms car and drive out of here as fast as you can  burn some rubber make some noise  and then i want you to meet me over on 5th street  can you do that  yeah  hey dont get caught all right  i dont want to have to explain why i let a 13yearold drive a car  now go  did you see it it just came   god  you idiot running around here with that hand cannon  you scared him off that was our one chance  i cant take this anymore  its too much  im with you  lets get out of town until it blows over  thats not an option  that is the only option  no ill get us some help  what youre gonna go to your brother  no what are you crazy im not asking him he is not getting involved  ill ill ask around  what are you gonna ask some knucklehead off the street to fix this no  if were gonna do this were gonna do it right  i know some people  oh man thats quinns car  uh i got to go  i dont care the cost  make the call  you okay  yeah im fine  look im sorry i i just got   well talk about it later  wait who are you calling  remember that bug that you helped me make  well now were gonna do some listening  quinn l let me just explain  councilman ryans wife saw you run through the parking lot with a gun  this guy is itching for any excuse to back out of our deal and you do something so stupid   let me just tell you what really happened  i was taking the gun to my car  it slipped okay  i i picked it up  are you using again  what no god no  we had a good thing going here  yeah  i dont mind doing the dirty work while you golf with your fancy little friends   as long as you keep your nose clean  you fall apart erik and i swear to god   no quinn just i swear im fine  really  you better be  cause if youre not  get yourself cleaned up  get the door  and erik no more episodes  thats awesome hes totally freaking out  i told you it was gonna work  but you got to promise me from now on you will stay at my moms until were done  i i promise  when you push someone to the point of desperation   theres always a chance theyll go looking for help which could be a problem  unless youre the one providing the help  mr carson  and you are uh mr luna  yeah who are you  peace of mind mr luna  thats what youre looking for isnt it  we need this done as quick as possible  so you think you can find this guy  im sure we can  mr carson filled us in on everything including yesterdays incident  nothing we cant handle  so uh how much are we talking  40 000 to start 40 000 to finish  but th thats crazy  50 000 total th thats as high as i go  sweet dreams gentlemen  wait wait fine  i want to be there when you take him out  i want to see his face  naturally  well be in touch when we find him  youre negotiating  what do you think youre buying a used car  they walked away what were you gonna do  this doesnt work we got two options run or die  oh man i thought that guy was gonna blow the deal there  i was walking back to the car as slow as i could  it worked  i made it clear if the expert assassins fail that hed better head for the hills  and fail we will  and i got a perfect spot for it down in hallendale  buddy of mine was a navy chaplain and he started a homeless outreach program  but hes in guatemala now so we got the place free and clear  then lets finish this  the sooner april and her boys dont have to worry about luna the better  if you want the appearance of a gunshot without actually dying   you need to create a highpowered burst of blood  a bottle cap packed with a bit of plastic explosive does the trick nicely  rig a few remote charges to create the sound of a firearm   and youve got everything you need  looks like were good to go  yes mr luna  i believe weve found the person thats been trying to kill you  morning  so where is he  hes in there  we scouted last night  looks like we got your shooter plus two support guys  h howd you find him so fast  the car you sold to mr carson could only have come from two factories in italy  that led us to the name of the original buyer  some guy named chuck finley if that means anything to you  the blue car you saw stolen from this neighborhood a few days back  and that place was rented a week ago in cash by mr chuck finley  i told you these guys were good  so we will hit them around the back through the alley  easypeasy  getting a target to do what you want requires a delicate touch  sometimes youre a bully and sometimes youre a friend  you two wait here  you come in after to confirm the kill  well all be at the beach before noon  dont look so nervous boys  theyre sitting ducks in there  itll be over in seconds  you have to know when to give the target help and comfort  and when to take it away  get back  where are they  where are they  run  nice fall shakespeare  oh you should talk you look like you got shot by a bow and arrow  you dont know what youre talking about  a 9mil at this range  guys guys guys the point is im pretty sure erik is planning on missing his next custody hearing  lets clean up and get out of here  when you work as a spy followthrough is crucial  even the bestexecuted plan can fall apart  god damn it zip  you dont score if you spike the ball before youre in the end zone  quinn what are you doing  i have to go somebodys trying to kill me i have to get out of town  what who  i dont know i dont know ive never seen him i cant stop him i i   what are you talking about youre not leaving town  you dont understand  i understand youre acting like a lunatic  what makes you think that somebodys trying to kill you  i dont think i know  hey hey our business depends on you  you dont get to leave town  but i saw three people killed this morning three people where  down i in hallendale  listen to me  now you pull it together  im gonna get my guys down here and were gonna find out what the hell you are talking about  all right  okay  whats up sam  we got a problem quinn got to erik before he could run  theyre headed back to hallendale  not good  i know we got to do something now  hang on fi  how much time do we have  well with drive time about a half an hour  why what are you thinking you got an idea  remember moscow  99  colonel prokov the one with the drinking problem  wait you want to pull that here  mike that took like weeks of prep to do that in a half an hour   not much choice sam  when a plan goes wrong you have two basic options  the first is to accept failure and abort the mission  that works best when you have the resources and time to remove personnel from the field  when you dont have resources and time youre left with option two  get back in there and salvage the situation any way you can  im all for a gunfight michael but this could be suicide  shes right mike  if it doesnt work youre gonna be here alone with quinns guys and all their guns  guess itll have to work then  theres a long tradition in spycraft of making enemy assets appear unreliable  make a loyal operative look like a traitor   for example and if youre lucky your enemies take him out for you  better than making an enemy look disloyal is making him look insane  it takes some doing but when you pull it off its more devastating than a bullet  sir how much for that apron and hat  and the cross too  they were right there  theres nothing here quinn  no blood no shells nothing  youre sure this is the spot  they must have moved the bodies  oh moved the bodies and cleaned up the blood  its like its like before the driveby driveby  yeah at the club they they turned off all all the lights   and then my phone wouldnt work the car doesnt start  then everything goes right back on  i i wanted to tell you quinn but i couldnt  you got to believe me  well youre making it real hard erik  theyre here theyre here  theyre theyre right up the block  show me  theyre right there  yeah we uh we shouldnt  w what if theyre in there  if theyre in there well be fine  may i help you  you  i i saw i saw you die  oh no  erik has it gotten worse  wait you know my brother  you must be quinn hes talked about you  im father peter our lady of grace charities  n no quinn t thats not thats pete hes one of them  i saw him killed  i do outreach for the homeless  i saw erik on the street one night in a in a daze  i tried to help him  no hes lying quinn   i said shut your mouth  dont be too hard on him  has he been talking about the killers  you you said there were killers  he sees assassins everywhere and now he claims to be hiring killers of his own to go after the other killers  ive tried to help him  youre a liar  get off  its all right erik your mind is sick  i know your pain  youre gonna get me killed  enough get off get him out  youre gonna get me killed  outside outside  its not eriks fault  he needs help and care  h hes lying to you quinn come on enough  you got to believe me  im not  its him  hes one of the killers too  yeah theyre in this together  he sells pineapple erik  shes one of them too  look shes one of them  please come on just tell them  please tell them please  get up no  get him in the car now now  i dont want to go in the car no  i am so sorry  hes lucky to have you for a brother  he he just winked inside  youre not a priest  its official  with erik locked up in a mental facility the judge had to give me full custody  were gonna stay with my cousin for a few months until we can get back on track  well this might help  it was eriks  40 000  i i dont know how to thank you  you saved our lives  you gonna be all right  i i dont know i guess  think my mom thinks im some sort of delinquent  i knew a kid once who had it rough growing up  almost as bad as you  and what happened to him  he got a job doing a lot of the same stuff that got him into trouble when he was a kid  he uh he turned out all right  so youre saying i should eat a lot of yogurt  cant hurt  well it sounds like losing erik put a big dent in quinn lunas business  the cops are looking into him  better than he deserves  mike youve been quiet all day  want a beer mike beer  come on its lowcalorie if that makes a difference  what im watching my weight  i should go i need to follow upon that strickler business  you want some company  no its just this inandout thing  ill be fine  have fun  looks like you wont be needing this  put it down  you know michael spying on a government employee with topsecret clearance is a serious crime  if asking nicely worked i wouldnt have to  so find out anything about strickler  care to share  thanks to you dropping that name   i spent the last four days dealing with reporting procedures for six different us intelligence outfits   including one i didnt know existed  thats in between the calls emails meetings  find out anything good  one more question and you go from being the burned spy i hate to the anonymous burglar i shot  ive got a career to think about here  i just needed to know how connected strickler is  im pretty sure you just answered my question  you know your champagnes michael  bollinger blanc de noirs  its my new friend champagne  dont pop the cork just yet  okay well we both know you checked my references   and we both know that i have the access you need  really the only question is whether we can figure out a mutually beneficial relationship  i help you you help me  so what do you say we make this a takeitorleaveit moment  im not sure what id be taking  a job for starters  youre perfect for it  say yes and i start the ball rolling today   and youre on your way back to being a respectable citizen again  say no youll never hear from me again  whats the job  i cant give you the details just yet but it wont offend your sensibilities  trust me  so in or out  as a spy you often have to do things you dont like for people you dont trust  you dont always get to choose who you do business with  when the devil himself is offering the thing you want most   sometimes you dance with the devil  im in
