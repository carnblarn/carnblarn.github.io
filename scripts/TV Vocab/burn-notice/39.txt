                michael my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  man we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  in the intelligence community  an invitation to meet at a hotel pool  is an olive branch  the person youre meeting  is offering you multiple escape routes  a crowd to mix in with  and the virtual certainty  that nobody is concealing a weapon in their bathing suit  but if youre meeting the kind of guy  who arranges coup detats for a living  its still a good idea to bring backup  champagne  why dont we ever come to these places  for anything other than surveillance  michael im not seeing anyone whos obviously here for a meeting  i dont know why youre willing to meet this gilroy  he sounds as bad as the people who burned you  hes worse  as far as i know they werent selling nuclear secrets  to anyone who can write a check  if the price is right fi  gilroy will put anything on the table  which makes this little rendezvous  not a very good idea in my opinion  if hes here in miami hes planning something big  i need to find out what  gilroy already killed your cia contact  thats exactly the point fi  this man is a freelance psychopath  and im the only one in a position  who can do anything about it  keep an eye out  westen  they say eyes are the windows to the soul  but i think hands tell you so much more  and you  you have a workingmans hands  well ive never been afraid to get them dirty  so ive heard  the company man gone bad  i have to say i find you quite fascinating  i bet you say that to all the girls  only the ones i like  well im flattered you should be  most people bore me especially americans   always some structure to report to some memo to file  everything in its proper box  for all your talk of rugged individualism  in my experience this is a nation of sheep  present company excepted of course  of course  and you how do you like to operate  i see opportunities and i take them  its much simpler much more fun  sounds like were a lot alike  an associate once told me that  tom strickler  you know him dont you  oh thats right  you shot him  im curious  what led to the actual  i did the work he banked the cash  i just figured id eliminate the middleman  eliminate him you did  unfortunately it made a certain cia agent  take an interest in stricklers business  and since i was stricklers business  you arranged to have him fall out of a fourthstory window  yes  it wasnt lost on me that you showed up at the scene  why was that  he wasnt just your problem  i was stricklers business too  it sounds like we have a lot in common  why dont we work together  tempting  but you were quite the boy scout once  and the project im working on  is definitely not for boy scouts  oh believe me ive been there and done that  and i see where it gets you  thats why i live by a new code    hmm  im not sure im ready for that yet  im still getting to know you  getting to know all about you  and your little girlfriend up there  champagnes on me   whats going on here sam  im moving mike  you found a place  yeah sorta im staying with miss reynolds and her mom  isnt she a little angry about   well the whole car getting wrecked thing  yeah sure but you know  sometimes a loss can bring people together  huh anyway i wish your mom would let me  keep some of this crap here  its just gonna have to go into storage  i was thinking you might want some of this stuff  look at that  that would go great at your place  or not  howd your meeting go with satans spawn  gilroy wont deal with me  until hes convinced im his kind of guy  you got a whole damn burn notice file that says you are  hes careful hes checking me out  hell look into the burn file keep an eye on me  i just have to make sure he likes what he sees  yeah but mike playing the rogue operative  after everything youve done to clear your name   are you sure  im already out  and if this is what i have to do to get in with gilroy  i dont have much choice  hey sam you got a visitor  says hes an old friend of yours  mack  hey man  been a long time  sam  thats okay  i deserved that  sam sam hey easy easy sam  that one too i suppose  all right look sam  i know you and i have had our problems  but i need your help  can i buy you a beer  please  im not in a drinking mood  sam who is this guy  oh we served together during my seal days  you dont look too excited to see him  yeah we had a bit of a fallingout  anything you want to talk about  im sorry mike i  maybe ill just let him buy me that beer  ill be all right  so you ever talk to any of the boys from the old unit  man the seals have come a long way   skip the small talk mack why are you here  all right  heres the deal  after the navy i took a job at the houston pd  i work childabduction cases  most of the time its the same old thing   some mixedup relative snatches a kid  cause of some stupid argument  every once in a while you get a true predator  and this ones the worst i ever seen  his names rincon  i built a whole case against him  enough to put him away for three lifetimes  we went to the house to get him busted down the door  and the whole goddamn place exploded  i lost a couple of my best men that day  sorry to hear that  there was a report on the incident  it said that i hadnt supervised the assault team properly  but that wasnt true  they still suspended me  what happened to him  they found some remains in the house   nothing conclusive  and the brass couldnt admit  that the bad guy walked away though  so they closed the case  and you think hes still alive  i know he is  rincon knew he was going down so he faked his death  and i traced the son of a bitch to miami  so you catch this guy you clear your name  is that the idea  sam if i go down  all my other cases go up in smoke  and a lot of bad guys could walk  all right  sorry  shouldnt have asked  so mack you figure this is a twoman job  could use a third man if you know anyone  i do but i wouldnt call her the third man to her face  thank you  look sam about our dustup   lets not get into it  we do this you go home  thats it  you got it  hey  what can i do for you maddy  you all right  that was some cheap shot you gave your friend  yeah well he deserved a lot more than that believe me  so what happened with you two  nothing that concerns you  well it does concern me  because ive never seen you like this before  and now youre doing some job with this guy  how do you know you can trust him  my issues with him are not professional they are personal  which is why i would prefer if youd just stay out of it  so how do you know  rincons gonna show up here  mack rincon was importing drugs from mexico  and ive been keeping track of his old contacts  i intercepted a call  and the word is hes doing a meeting here today  so you cant take that to the da  theyre smart enough not to use the guys name  plus the phone tap wasnt exactly legal  our guest has arrived wow  somehow he looks even more like a child predator and cop killer  than he did in the picture  all right  you sit tight we cant spook this guy  neighborhood watch is just a nice idea in most suburbs  but where you really see it in action is the inner city  only there it doesnt protect against crime  it protects against cops  just like cops have dru gdetecting dogs  some neighborhoods have copdetecting kids  once the alarm goes out  criminal activity shuts down like a picnic when it rains  and any fugitives run like jackrabbits  chicle  polica  they think were police fi this is bad  if rincon thinks the cops know hes here hes gone  then well just have to show everyone that were not cops  what are you looking at  want to hurry up with this sister  you want to stop distracting me  yeah hey hey  mack so you stole this car  what did you want us to do  we had to prove to them that we werent cops  you saw the place  its a nofly zone for gringos  mike listen i know youre a little preoccupied  with this whole gilroy business  yeah hes going to be a handful  i think if michael has time for gilroy  then he has time for finding a child predator  okay whats the problem  well we didnt exactly blend in to the neighborhood  where rincons hiding  the second we made our move  the locals sounded the cop alarm and he ran  look once you get off the side streets forget it  you set one foot on the main boulevard  you might as well have a spotlight on you  any chance that rincon will pop up again  no this is our only chance  this is over unless  hang on  hes probably still in the area  yeah but if we cant go looking for him   someone in the neighborhood will have to look for us  someone with an ear to the ground  someone rincon wont see coming mikes right  the local gang will know the neighborhood better than anyone  someone at the top  was smart enough to set up a network of eyes and ears  hell be able to find rincon  wait you saying that were gonna get  the local gang leader to help us  you got a better idea  so a buddy of mine pulled some police files on this area  local gang leaders name is omar hernandez  his crew controls this neighborhood  he started out doing all the normal gangbanger stuff   you know boosting cars running guns  whats his business now  must be dealing drugs  he got guys looking out for the police  yeah well hes dealing drugs  but not the kind youre thinking about  we got aspirin cold medicine  throw in some baby formula too  omars the lead suspect  in a bunch of chainstor ewarehouse breakins  see the bodegas are fencing the stuff  got ourselves a regular robin hood  yeah and he knows how to take care of business too  omars last arrest  was for beating the bejesus out of some guy  who was smacking his girlfriend around  what you defending this guy  you think this neighborhood  gets a lot of protection from the cops  im just saying the guys a thug  getting him to find rincon for us is gonna be tough  ill have to be extra convincing  in an army  a chain of command gets activated by unusual events   tanks amassing on a border  a hacking attack on a central computer  assassinations of key personnel  a street gangs chain of command is no different  showing up in a stolen car  and making a splashy entrance  will get a message sent up the ladder  im looking for omar  oh yeah  well weve been looking for that car  well you found it  sorry  we dont know no omar  aah  ill be waiting for omar in there  here comes the king of the barrio  nice suit  what are you the devil or something  call me whatever you like  but my name is louis  lets beat his ass omar  what is it you want louis  a man named rincon is hiding in your neighborhood  youre going to find him for me  why would i do that  because his business is hurting children  and your business is protecting them  you seem to know a lot about me  i dont know nothing about you  you know all you need to know  you got a funny way of talking  you use words but you dont say nothing  i say what i mean  well let me say what i mean  yeah i protect my people  i provide for them  if it wasnt for me and my crew  gangbangers one block over  would be doing driv ebys in the middle of the street  and little babies would be going hungry  so see i dont got time to play with no devil  or whatever you think you are  the devil wants rincons soul  i just want the man  the faster you give him to me the faster i go away  or what  or this  man hes gone  madeline is that the bad guy  oh its more like the guy  whos supposed to go looking for the bad guy  put a tracker and a bug in his car  how come youre not out with sam  your boy and sam got a peculiar way of doing things  sam thought it would be best  if i kept a watch on things from here  what happened with you two  you know with all due respect maam  thats  thats really none of your business  oh  well im making it my business  hes my sons best friend  and come to think about it hes mine too  the point is im worried about him  hes not himself  with the drinking   no no sams always liked his beer  hes not drinking is what im saying  a all right here it is  you know he was married  ohh  you screwed around with his wife  it wt that simple  yeah well it never is  what do we have sam  well omars been talking a lot  about some crazy guy who wants him to find rincon  but he hasnt made a move yet  whos mr personality there  oh thats felipe vega  they work together  no vega runs a bigger gang northside 13  theyve been inching in on omars neighborhood  hes careful yeah and ruthless  his crews been busy collecting scalps  mostly rival gangbangers it looks like  i like your neighborhood  its nice and clean  everybody seems so happy  is that a new car  its new enough  dont try to play me omar  i know youre doing all right  pretty busy inside there  now you got my shipment  nah  everything i have i got people counting on it  i told you i was gonna be by every week  and i told you i dont got it  so you can keep what you took last week  what i took  it sounds like i stole something  look lets get something straight  that was payment for protection  you never know who come in here and start trouble for you  see what i mean  isultame por favor  let go hey hey ya ya ya para  now me and you got a beef  no youll get your shipment  just get out of here  get out of here  youre pushing it omar  now you pack my stuff up in the van   the good stuff the prescription stuff  my boys will pick it up at your warehouse over on 26th  and omar  dont try and burn me again  vmanos sam looks like hes got bigger problems than you mike  guess ill have to become a bigger problem then what are you thinking  if that van vega wants goes missing  omar will have to deal with whoever took it  and thats you  okay i guess well have to get over to omars warehouse  because warehouses store bulk items and not people  theyre usually built cheaply  most of the time the roofs are just plywood and asphalt tiles  attach a holesaw bit to a silenced drill  and you can bore through the roof  without attracting attention  if you want to create a bigger opening  a few ounces of c4  on the brackets holding the door in place  will do the trick  all set mike  youll be able to stroll right in  yeah fi  uhoh we got a visitor  its gilroy in a maserati up the block  what is he doing here  getting to know me  i guess ill have to put on a good show  dominance in the battlefield  isnt always about the use of a lethal force  sometimes its more effective  to leave a few targets around to spread the word  ungh  rubbercomposite bullets  fired from a suppressed rifle  wont kill your enemy  ohh  but it will make them think twice  about staying in the fight  what do you want  im here for the van what van  selling yourself to an adversary  is a bit like getting drafted on a sports team  you may look good on paper  but eventually theyll want to see you on the field  why the hell are you following me  just curious about where that van of yours is headed  i told you  i have to get to know you  you can do that without compromising my operations  i had to see you in action  and i have to say youve lived up to your reputation  such panache  i love the suit who are you wearing  you know youre awfully confident  i wont shoot you right here  dont be  maybe im just not that afraid of rubber bullets  you were awfully gentle with those chaps at the warehouse  i was as gentle as i had to be  i cant have a homicide detective poking around  hmm fair enough  is that why you were following me   to compliment me on my suit and ask me stupid questions  i came to see if youre the sort of person id like to work with  and it appears that you are  im glad you like what you saw  i have a little project that may interest you  ill be in touch  oh by the way who is the van for  i dont kiss and tell  good to know  oh jesus ive been calling you  i threw my phone away  i think gilroy used my phone to triangulate my position  hes good  i just got that phone two days ago  well what did he want  he wanted to see if i was the same kind of monster he is  apparently i am  no youre not  but if you fake it long enough  you dont have to worry about me fi  look i know you want to stop whatever hes planning  but cant we just shoot him and get on with our lives  gilroy does work for hire  hes the tip of a very nasty iceberg  it doesnt end with him  sam  hey fi is mikey there  yeah hes here  he was looking for you too  yeah sam  ive been monitoring the fallout from your warehouse stunt  omars pretty freaked about his missing van  i guess its time to see  if hes ready to help us find rincon  hes at the botanica on 17th  omar  i want the van now where is it  i can tell you where it will be   in your driveway when you give me rincon  im not afraid of you man  you may have some fancy little tricks  but youre still flesh and blood  and believe me i know how to make you bleed  you touch me and your whole world comes apart  im not talking about just your car  im talking about your house on east 18th street  your stores on river drive  you  there wont be a place on this earth that you can hide  you give me rincon and ill disappear  i need a few hours  youre not packing my ice babies are you  uh no maddy those are staying behind  good cause you destroyed  half my winter wonderland collection  when you blew up my house  come on now i thought we were past all that  we are i was just pulling your chain  the truth is i was thinking about replacing them anyway  so it really didnt matter what you did with them  i mean seriously why would i hold this against you  you talked to mack didnt you  sam your marriage had been over for years  before he ever said a word to your wife  theres a code madeline  you dont sit in another mans canoe period  were not talking about a boat sam  yeah and im not talking  about some creepy ic eskating figurine either  you let her go  was she supposed to be miserable the rest of her life  he took very good care of her  and i told you to stay out of it  you want to be like that fine  you still owe me an iceskating snowman  the best defense isnt always a show of force  keep an adversary in the dark about what youre capable of  and he has to assume the worst  jesus man  we looked for your guy  you found rincon  yeah i found him  you know how protected he is  you had three hours to give me rincon  not give me excuses  you thought you were so smart right  stealing that van that vega wanted  well guess what thats whos protecting rincon  i hear theyre business partners man  rincons been supplying vega with drugs for years  you think hes gonna give up that connection let me worry about that  no man i got to worry about it  me and vega are this close to going to war already  if he founds out man   look i aint afraid to die okay  but my people vega will go after everybody  if you dont give me what i want  vega will be the least of your worries  rincons hiding in an abandoned housing project  on west 15th unit 402  hes got some of vegas guys with him  you better hurry  and you better pray vega doesnt find out  when youre extracting a heavily guarded target  its important to choose the right entry point  guards watch windows and doors  so if you come in  through the common wall of a neighboring apartment  youve got surprise on your side  not to mention a shower of shattered concrete  shh  what is it mike its a little too quiet in there  and a little too quiet out there too  of course surprise doesnt count for much  if youre walking into a trap  looks like vega decided to crash the party  we got guys coming up the stairs  i hope you brought enough rope sam  traditional rappelling requires holding a rope with both hands  which is inconvenient if youre being shot at  thats why special forces  are trained to rappel in unconventional ways  aah  get down  it was a goddamn setup  your boy omar almost got us killed  that doesnt make any sense  he hates vega just calm down  oh the hell i will omar sold us out  thats funny  you talking about betrayal  boys fight and get it over with or put a sock in it  youre gonna want to hear this  what is it ive been listening to the bug in omars car  vega tried to kill him too  omar oh god damn it get down  jesus omar youre bleeding  drive man go  he got clipped in the arm  i hope i screamed less when it happened to me  vega found out omar was looking for rincon  well he nearly got killed because of us  and vegas probably not gonna stop until he finishes the job  i cant believe im saying this about a gangbanger  but we ought to do something to help omar  yeah  omar  man you got some balls coming here  you shouldnt point guns at friends  oh now you my friend i can be  man we almost got killed because of you  vegas got guys looking all over for us  hes gonna tear up the whole neighborhood  man i should have shot you while i had the chance  you shoot me youll still have a problem with vega  you dont vega will have a problem with me  you dont know what youre talking about  vega and rincon   theyre gonna take miami apart until they find you  why dont i save them the trouble  i want you to take me to them  i will finish this for both of us  man you crazy  hear me outinside  now  wait wait wait wait wait wait  all right  just dont do nothing  i give him you thats not enough  i got to give him my whole damn neighborhood  vega has to believe hes won  i dont know about this man  hes gonna want to meet on my territory make a big show  you want him to  he just has a few guys with guns on his side  you have a whole neighborhood on yours  but what about when we get inside  vegas gonna have that place locked down tight  he wont let any of my boys in with us  its just you and me  if everything goes right you and me is all we need  i leave with rincon  you leave with vega  are you ready to end this or not  im ready  camouflage is commonly associated with jungle warfare  but the truth is that its just as important in urban settings  youre bound to draw attention  setting up a bulletproof barricade on the sidewalk  or toting a concussion charge down the street  but fruit stands reinforced  with strips of steelbelted tires  and icecream carts packed with explosives blend right in  of course the ultimate trojan horse is a shackled prisoner  where have you been hiding these  a paranoid enemy might go so far  as frisking a hostage whos wearing handcuffs  but people tend not to check if one of the handcuff links  is made of polystyrene  or if theres a listening device in the pinlock  welcome to my neighborhood omar  now everyone said  the people in your neighborhood were so loyal  i dont see none of them here  you know when you started sticking your nose  in my business  i figured you were up to something  so i grabbed one of your guys  one hour with my knife  he started spilling everything  thats all you get for loyalty   one hour  yeah i guess youre right  you disappoint me  everyone said ooh omar will go down in a blaze of glory  one little scratch on your arm  and you come crying to me like a bitch to kiss my ring  i think we just had a misunderstanding thats all  misunderstanding  i like that  lets get this misunderstanding cleared up right now  show me your mystery man  vmanos  so we cool  cool  you think one freak in a suit  is gonna make things even  let me tell you something   in my kingdom peace dont come cheap  today ill take your neighborhood  tomorrow ill take your woman  its a new world omar  get used to it  get these putos inside  come on  the rest of you stay out here  if they want some shoot them  so who are you  i asked you a question  who are you  youll find out soon enough  ugh  are you a cop  a cop  youre not that lucky  ugh  answers  tell me what kind of man comes looking for me  dressed in a suit like that  what kind of man  what kind of man preys on children  did that bitch who brought those charges against me send you  hmm  she was always whining about her kid  tell me who you are or i will make this so painful  that you will beg for mercy and it will not come  you dont know what pain is  but you will i promise  dont look at them  theyll see what you really are  coward  go to hell  come with me  welcome to my neighborhood  i made you a promise  its time  miami pd is transporting rincon back to houston  hes lucky hes not going back in a body bag  you know you and your friends  got a strange way of doing things  but i guess i cant complain  thank you sam  yeah hey um about amanda   just wanted to say  thanks for taking care of her  i was never real good about doing that  i guess the mission always came first  yeah well for what its worth  she left me too  dont think she ever got over you  who could  you ever need anything   ill let you know  hey maddy you feel like having a beer  come on  so a lot of people are asking about the guy in the suit  i dont know what to tell them  im just the guy that helped you get back on top  thats all  still cant figure you out man  honestly omar  dont try  hey fi thanks for coming  shut up  theres something that i have to say  you want me backing you up  on more of these little gilroy meetings  then youre gonna hear me out right here right now  in another one of these little wasted hotel rooms  you are gonna get yourself killed  youre gonna wind up dead  umim not dead yet  you know i have more ammunition in this case than i need  you want to be quiet or you want me to start using it  sam doesnt agree with me  and i didnt want to worry your mother  otherwise this would be a ful lscale intervention  you work too hard  fi  shh  i appreciate what you did finding rincon  and theres maybe a little part of me  that understands what youre doing with gilroy  but that cannot be what you do all day every day  you cannot keep burning the candle at both ends michael  how do you expect to stay focused  when you exhaust yourself like this  you need a life  or youre gonna wind up dead  its just basic operational sense  are you finished  sure fine  where do you want me  how about right here  gilroy said he would call here  for the place and the time of our meeting  he said he would call here  tomorrow morning  michael did you ask me here to   like i said im not dead yet  hello  good morning westen  gilroy youre up early  as are you  surprising given what a busy boy youve been lately  oh  oh no need to be coy  i hear there was a certain transfer of power  in a certain section of little dominica  that a certain someone had a role in facilitating  i wouldnt know about that  you really dont kiss and tell do you  well since youre up any chance we can have a chat  id love to but uh   but you have a more pressing engagement  you could say that  dont keep me waiting  so were in business  yes we are  and theres lots of work to be done
