                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  if someone calls a meeting in a deserted location  they want control  they can tell if youre alone and if you try anything  its easy to take you out with a sniper  so if someone wants a chat in the middle of nowhere  it never hurts to bring a sniper of your own  youre awfully quiet sam  yeah well what do you want me to say  that im worried gilroy got wind that youre doublecrossing him  or that i got a bad feeling about this mystery man  that he wants to jailbreak  everythings fine just calm down  no i dont think i will  you know what kinds of people they ferry around  on secret planes in supermax custody  people with forked tongues mike  people with hair on their palms  maybe you want a closer look at this monster  but i say its time to walk away  gilroys doing this with or without me  we cant stop him till we know how hes pulling it off  yeah well you know what they say  about holding a snake by the tail mike  i think its a tiger by the tail sam  yeah well either way  you let go of it before it eats your face off  hes here sam  try and stay in the open will you  i cant cover a moving car  and if that evil limey mastermind offers you a ride  you treat him like a stranger with candy  and you say no thank you sir   nice wheels gilroy  you like  cost me a fortune but shes armored like a tank  sorry to ring you out of the blue  but its such a lovely day  i thought wed go for a drive  oh mike dont you dare  why not  ah why am i still surprised  the curtains about to part for our grand finale  but there remains one minor detail to address  this compound belongs to the knights of resistance  a group of rightwing separatists   white supremacists  potato potahto  now youre to purchase an item from their armory  an item  you want me to go on a gun buy without a shopping list  i thought we were playing for the same team gilroy  indeed we are  i suppose youve earned your place in this partnership  its a browning 50caliber machine gun   happy  thrilled partner  youre to ask for duke  the price has been prenegotiated  well off you go  appreciate you making the trip  too many of our white brothers arent willing to drive out here  even if it means buying from the cubans and jamaicans  no offense but im here for the price not the people  and the only color i care about is green  we gonna do this or not  suit yourself  right through here  uh something you want to tell me duke  see we aint arms dealers were freedom fighters  our guns arent for sale  but wed like to thank you for your donation  anything to help the cause  you want to help the cause  get a new favorite color  fighting two against one is never ideal  but there are ways to even the odds  jam your opponents into a corner  and they wont have room to use both arms  its like fighting one person with two angry heads  it makes them easier to engage and easier to disengage  didnt go as planned  actually it went exactly as planned  you still have the money i have a new toy  howd that case treat you by the way  handy  its never fun being used as a diversion  but it is an effective way to get the drop on an enemy  with superior numbers and firepower  then its all about making a clean getaway  if you cant do that it never hurts to be in an armored car  you know i had a funny feeling  those guys might try to rip us off  eat or be eaten i suppose  next time you send me in as a decoy  a headsup would be nice  honestly michael if you couldnt survive  a goround with duke and jimbo you deserve to get killed  thanks to you  security at the armory wasnt exactly watertight  you know 50 caliber  thats quite a party favor gilroy  i find that 50caliber rounds  have a delightful way of making ones problems die  thats funny  artillery like that makes me a little itchy about this job  if you want me to scratch your back just say so  were having a dress rehearsal tomorrow  youll get everything you need to know partner  until then tata  sam youre doing dishes  yeah well i had to do something to pass the time  you have any idea what you put me through  getting in that car with jack the ripper  so you got enough intel on this dirty deed to wrap up gilroy  well not exactly but i did help him steal a browning 50 cal  well forgive me if i dont pat you on the back  do you think you could get in touch  with your contacts at the fbi  you know the ones you used to inform on me to  yeah no problemo  for your sake michael i hoped you were dead  i can put up with a lot  but four calls without so much as a text back  that just takes me right to the edge  whats on your mind fi  a hustler named coleman wants to meet about a gig  he once helped me with a cashflow problem  he deals in counterfeit bags stolen phones  hes a harmless weasel but his gigs pay top dollar  i thought you might like to come just in case  ooh i have a meeting with the fbi  why dont you talk to sam  sam  so im in a tiny little jam and i say to myself  coleman if you need a hardcore badass chick  well bud theres only one lady to go to  fiona glenanne  ladys a bit of a stretch  im sorry who are you again  oh hes just my gofer  he cleans my guns fetches my dry cleaning  what kind of job we talking about here  you know youre awfully chatty for the help  yes he is  be quiet while the grownups are talking  answer the question anyway  you know how this works babe  i cant tell you exactly what the gig is until you agree to do it  hey hey eyes over here  you see this  thats 10 large 5 up front 5 when you finish   come on after everything weve been through  you know that im already doing this at cost right  wow  fine  be at this address at 600  and do us a favor  leave mr chuckles at home will you  so lets get this straight you want us to stop gilroy  who no one can prove is even in the country  from hijacking a plane no government will acknowledge  thats rich westen  fine alert the cia make it their problem  look they wont take my calls  but i figured a tip from the fbi  maybe theyll take it seriously  harris question so far as it concerns  calling the territorial jackasses at langley  where would you put that on the old todo list  hmm maybe 400 500  gilroys in possession of a 50cal machine gun  i have firsthand knowledge  you uh tell us where hes keeping the hardware  maybe thats something we can work with  i dont know  dont you think id tell you if i could  so we just have to look under every rock  from here to epcot center that the idea  nah  little suggestion for you  next time you want to cry wolf  do it at a caf on south beach huh  when youre buying  you know how some people promise  never to call the cops on their friends no matter what  well you and me were still up in the air  ah dont get your knickers in a twist  coleman probably just wants a babysitter for a gun deal  anyone ever tell you its rude to text while someones talking  are you bugging my cellphone  right now you and mike are fighting for top bunk in sams doghouse  i already watched one of you wander away with a psycho today  ill be damned if it happens again  as promised 10000 ways to say welcome aboard  now that im officially on payroll  you want to tell me what this is about  ill let the boss go over the details with you  dont worry were about to have cocktails with him right now  youre just the middleman on this  you know i prefer facilitator  boss goes by gabriel  hes kind of picky about who he works with  so to close the deal  i had to add a few adventures to our work history  i told him you helped me out with a couple of ransom jobs  a few years back in madrid  dont worry about it it wont come up its just a meet and greet  oh you got to be kidding me  hey if you aint feeling it let me know  id be more than happy to take back my 10 gs  fi do not go in that house crap  hey how you doing fella  i really need some new friends  there he is coleman  and you must be fiona  i have to tell you  ive heard such wonderful things about you  but now seeing you in person  i get the feeling that none of them do you justice  oh you havent heard the half of it  im sure i havent  this way please  to new friends wherever the road may take us  salud  coleman tells me that you spent some time in madrid  for my money  theres nothing quite like an evening stroll down la rambla  what do you think  la rambla is in barcelona  you sure you need another drink  perhaps not  but thats never stopped me before  i am going to have to see your passport though  right now  my passport  i dont have it on me  you need to know my age you can just ask  i wouldnt dream of it  but wherever it is  it had better be stamped barajas airport madrid 2006  or were going to find ourselves  in a very uncomfortable situation  operate in the field long enough  and youll find yourself getting tested  by very dangerous people  so tell me where can we find it  my bedroom dresser  third drawer has a false bottom  passports under the alias kelly minch  please leave everything the way you found it  the more immediate and unexpected the test  the more likely theyre up to serious trouble  and the more likely theyll kill you if you dont pass  come on mike pick up pick up  yeah sam  mike i need you to grab the id kit i keep at the loft  get to fis right away  is she okay  yeah as long as you get there like 10 minutes ago  ill buy you some time but you better skedaddle  between matching holograms and colorshifting inks  altering a page in a modern passport  is virtually impossible  so if all the pages are full  and you have to adjust someones travel in a hurry  its better just to swap out the page entirely  its as easy as pulling out the stitching on a cheap tshirt  you just need the skill to put it back together  hey knock yourself out  all the honking in the world  isnt gonna put my rear axle back into alignment  uh mike you got two bogeys coming your way  i hope youre wrapping it up  im doing the best i can sam  theres no saying im sorry in the field  so if it feels like a gambles about to come up short  you put on a smile and try to get your hands on a weapon  without anyone noticing  no need to stop the party would you care for another  excuse me  dime  interesante  si gracias  fiona i must apologize  in my line of work you cant be too careful  i know the feeling  to madrid  what the hell is going on  look i had nothing to do with it  she gets an idea in that little irish skull of hers  and thats the end of it  im going back in with gabriel  for 10 grand  if someones willing to kill you over a passport  you walk away fi  ordinarily yes  then sam showed me this  allen king taken at gunpoint  right after gabriel got into town  okay so maybe i had a little something to do with it  so its a kidnapping ring   you call the cops its not your problem  the cops  gabriel is a pro hed sniff them out in a heartbeat  did he tell you what the job is  so youre meeting with a paranoid thug  with no idea what hes up to  yeah that sounds like a great way to get yourself killed  are we talking about gabriel now or gilroy  the caption says please give me my daddy back  im not letting her grow up without a father  if i can save him by going to a meeting  i told her it was too risky to put a mike on her again  but you know its fi  one of the doors has a padlock in the house  something tells me hes not using it as a game room  i need to search it i dont need your permission  that passport wont be the last time he tests you  we might not be able to save you the next time  just give me 10 minutes alone in the house  and ill see whats behind that door  your security has a way of making a girl feel welcome  were both professionals  no more games no more background checks  just tell me about the job  no i dont think so  we dont even know if youre qualified yet  beretta 9millimeter  break it apart and put it back together  ill give you one minute   begin  im sorry  you want me to do this with my eyes open or closed  you can tell a lot about a person  by the way they take a pistol apart  do they rush do they take their time  can they react quickly when attacked  you dont scare easy good  all done  how did i do  not bad  sam  sorry mike  chewing helps me with the nerves  you know its an old seal trick  so you think its go time  give it another minute  we move too soon theyll get suspicious  i just hate fi being in there alone  looking for that hostage by herself  well she knew what she was getting into   do you have another piece  yeah  coleman call in sick  coleman wont be joining us anymore  he forced himself on the girl that you replaced  and almost compromised the entire operation  so he  has been dismissed  i have a terrible fear of risk  so let me ask you can i trust you fiona  you searched me we did your test  you want to waterboard me too  why are you here  cash isnt that why youre here  i think youll recognize this  this is your file from interpol  tell me something  why does a nice catholic girl  with no apparent interest in politics  no history of violence  decide to join the ira  and blow up cars all over belfast  we didnt have girls soccer  revenge happy  okay just tell me one more time  cause i always get this stuff mixed up  if fi is wearing one button down on her blouse  everythings groovy   two buttons down  somethings wrong  yeah well thats a first  too many buttons down on a womans blouse is a bad thing  come on am i right  gilroy  okay see ya  yeah  michael its the big day before our big day  ive got butterflies  but i cant work on my lines without a script  well nothing ruins a script like too much improvisation  get something to write  ill give you directions to rehearsal  look at this  after the ira life is good  you have a gorgeous flat  youre a star on the black market  and then you decide to throw it all away  and move to miami   why  i followed a man here  and how did that work out  not quite as i hoped next question  you had a sister named claire  one moment shes out shopping  the next an english soldier fires into a crowd  she chokes to death on her own blood  tell me what was the first thought that crossed your mind  when you got that news  boss  youd better get out here  ill be right back  im sorry do we have a problem here  bet your asphalt  and larry moe and curly here  havent exactly been giving me the royal treatment  but no matter  chuck finley shady glade homeowners association  how are you sir good to see you  anyway a couple things i want to bring to your attention here  this is the shady glade hoa rule book  now if you had taken a couple hours to read appendix seven  well i might not be here right now sir  let me ask you a quick question  whens the last time you mowed your lawn  he doesnt even know my word  thats why im here want to point this out to you  youve got some areas that are clearing 5 inches easy here  as a covert operative  you learn that not every locked door  leads to the secret youre looking for  you may be searching for a hostage  but find something just as important  like what your target is obsessed with  like what your target loves  well mr finley uh i can assure you  that this problem will be taken care of immediately okay  uh im sorry you had to come out here  sweet georgia with a fiddle  my goodness sir  is that florida crabgrass  this is a st augustine community only  now crabgrass is as contagious as a brush fire  you know what happens if it spreads  were gonna have to ask you to get out of the neighborhood  all right ill just say it again  wed have to come right up to you yell in your face  get out  im sorry but im going to have to ask you to get out now  well hey thats fine  ive got everything i need to make an assessment  and its not gonna be pretty sir  fiona  ladies room  you know what  i think its time we went for a ride  come on  oh id love to  he buy it  easy as a hotfudge sundae  oh mike does she  two buttons down shes in trouble  jesus if hes driving like that we cant follow him  i know  maybe we can pick him up on the way back through  if they come back through  i know a back way that runs along the road  over there  is my house too warm for you  i notice that you undid another button on your blouse  you dont miss much do you gabe  since youre looking you want me to undo another  i was a doctor back in argentina  one day  an american company came to my little town to build computer chips  the governor called it a day of progress  it all started with the adults  headaches fevers  usually they recovered  but with the children it was a different story  i did my best to treat them  but what can you do when a company  is dumping chemical waste into the water table  what can you do  is that really necessary  my daughters name was eva  she was beautiful  i tried everything to save her  but i couldnt  lets go  get out  now  stop right there  turn around  i wish it didnt have to be this way  but this is so much bigger than me  and if i cant trust you i cannot work with you   now listen  no stop  i think they pulled over across the way  no mike sit tight  hes gonna kill her sam  wh mike youre not gonna hit the guy from here with a pistol  shes better off handling this on her own  its like you said she knew what she was getting into  the hardest thing to do when an operation goes bad  is nothing at all  its pure torture but if its the only way  to give a team member a chance at survival  you have no choice but to stand by and watch  i am sorry  bread pudding  my first thought when claire died  we had a fight  i spilled juice cranberry juice on her sweater  and we said vicious things stupid things  i made her favorite dessert as an apology  it tasted dreadful  but claire  never knew  my little sister died angry at me  i know how you feel about the people who killed your daughter  i feel the same way about the men  who kept claire from trying my awful dessert  i i never told anyone that before  if you cant trust me  you go ahead and pull that trigger  after my daughter died  i went to train with the rebels in colombia for two years  i taught them field medicine  and they taught me how to fight to survive  to do   what had to be done  exactly  you kidnapped a man last week  a scientist allen king  it was in the paper i could do the math  he works for apex industries  i made it clear to them  that they need to shut down their factory in argentina  the deadlines in five hours  theyre not negotiating  maybe not this time  but next time i think they will  hes head counsel for apex always travels with security  but like all of us he has a weakness  hes going to meet an escort tonight  let me guess im just his type  get him alone we avoid any unnecessary bloodshed  negotiators tend to be a little more flexible  when theyre the hostage  and what happens to allen king when you get this guy  he has a daughter gabriel  i dont want to hurt him trust me  but sometimes to do something good  we must first do something terrible  you know i dont have a choice  apex has to learn that were serious  anyone with a little tradecraft  knows spilling a drink on yourself  is a common excuse to leave a table  to convince a pro its truly an accident then  you have to sell it with more than iced tea  im so sorry im so sorry  are you all right  i should clean up  michael  fi you in the hotel  it doesnt matter were not staying  the hostage wasnt at gabriels house  forget about the hostage  do what you have to do but get out of there  hes not letting me out of his sight  until i help kidnap an executive from apex industries  once i do hes gonna kill the hostage  how long before he kills the hostage  about three hours  hes taking me back to the house to change  help me stop this  all right tell me whats in your bag  hurry before he gets suspicious  sunglasses duct tape and lipstick  okay we can work with that  im gonna leave you a package at the house  same way we used to do the drops in dublin  im not gonna risk losing you again fi  what do we got a couple hours  why dont you just let me drop the package to fi  you see gilroy  if theres one thing hes good at  its getting your mind off of things  thanks sam  so should i be asking  why youre playing with my lipstick sam  uh thats sort of ntk  oh sorry in civilian speak thats   need to know  yeah  so what youre gonna plant a bug on fi right  try this  midnight shadows  its got a nice heft to it  put something in there theyll never know it  planting a surveillance device inside an existing item  is all about working with what you have  if the battery necessary to power a bug is too big  you cant use it  a tracker with a ping system on the other hand  can send your location in bursts  and doesnt suck a lot of power  making a terrific accessory for any lady on the go  what the hell you think youre doing  hey back off curly  im collecting soil samples for h q  hey we can do this the easy way or the hard way  but we are getting to the bottom of this crabgrass situation  no no you get out of here  you know i thought wed be meeting  a little closer to the airport  still stuck on those flight records you stole for me  well forget them your stage is here  tomorrow ill be driving through here  your job is to keep the road clear of witnesses  obstacles that sort of thing  ill pick you up at a rendezvous point  and well be on our merry way  when do i get to work my magic with the 50 cal  oh no this stays with me  i take care of anyone who slips past you and the bridge  of course one prefers not to use such things in populated areas  the rounds go for miles  wow you keep me in the dark  and you hold on to the artillery  you said i was getting everything i needed to know today  you said we were partners  but we are michael  im the partner who tells you what to do  and youre the partner who does it  hilarious have fun on your own  its about a man an inmate  he handpicked you for this job  id say hes rather obsessed with you  his name  sorry hed kill me if i spoiled the surprise  sorry not good enough  time for second thoughts is over  tomorrow dont come for me  dont come for the obscene fortune were going to make  come for all the people i have to kill  if you dont do your job  youll meet the target at the bar  hell invite you up to his room  at which point you take out his guards  no guns silence is golden  me and my men will be in afterwards to show him out  theyre in position now  attagirl fi  her signals coming through loud and clear  okay take a right  so gilroy has you doing guard duty out in the boonies  at least you dont have to hijack a plane  he must have someone else at the airport  he wouldnt go through all this trouble  to have me babysit some pavement  tomorrow i may need you to hang around the airport  with some of your cop buddies  you got it ah fi just pinged again from the same spot  looks like theyve reached their destination  same hotel  gabriel used the lunch as a scouting trip  all right ill stay in the car  in case one of gabes goons is in there  so any bright ideas on how to stop gabes next kidnapping  figuring it out as i go sam  good luck with that  like con men spies know that in the workplace  a clipboard is as good as a skeleton key  but nobody from the health inspectors office called  what part of surprise visit do you not understand  do you want me to just shut this place down right now  i am not gonna sugarcoat this  weve been getting more letters than the north pole  about this kitchen  this is not a drill  you two i want you to pull  every head of lettuce from this afternoon  we find rat feces you find a new job  lets go  you i want you to go into the freezer  i want you to find expiration dates on all the meat  lets move lets go  i dont care who you are  you cant order the employees to stop working  without the managers permission  well then you should go you know go get the manager  restaurant kitchens have grease fires all the time  a little oil on a burner and you can clear out a restaurant  without raising too much suspicion  or causing too much damage  hey you got a grease fire in there  still its best not to stick around too long  after youve set a kitchen on fire  we have to assume the operations been compromised  compromised it was a fire its called bad luck  i dont believe in bad luck okay  im shutting this down  leave your things here  we cant risk leaving any evidence behind  yo shes back on the grid mike  how far  about two miles  something tells me though theyre not headed to the beach  chances are hes taking her to the hostage  gabriels gonna kill him or have fi do it for him  no one guarding your hostage  not necessary  the most careful bad guys dont just watch for tails  and wipe off fingerprints  if you want to be extra sure you cant be traced  you rig all the evidence against you to go up in flames  if anyone starts looking somewhere they shouldnt  this is a sedative drip  you want to end it all all you do is increase the dosage  completely painless  another trick you learned from your rebels  no this one i taught them  theres a risk in being  too obsessed with countersurveillance  spend your life paranoid always looking for threats  and it makes it easy for someone to find them for you  pros call it seeing ghosts  did you see that gabriel in the grass  stay here  well this is it  last place we got a signal so wheres fi  fiona  fiona  im sorry but i cannot let you kill an innocent man  what are you talking about innocent  my daughter was innocent  the children his companys killing theyre innocent  whos protecting them huh   inside  what would you have done for claire   how far would you have gone  get inside  thats right were the same you and me  the only difference are the circumstances  tell me im wrong  the police will be here soon  i cant go to jail you know that  everything i worked for will be wasted  goodbye gabriel   maybe someday  theres not going to be a someday  i only have one thing to live for  and now thats gone  what are you doing   give me the key  no  give me the key let me help you  you want to help me  go back down to argentina and tell them that i failed  tell them theyre on their own  no  go get out of here   get out of here  go god damn you  jesus fi   mike what are you doing  get him clear  no god damn it youre gonna suffocate in there  ill get fi you get him out  if youre not out in one minute im coming in after you  fiona were going now  no im not going without him  so the cops picked up gabriel at the warehouse  hes looking at some serious time  oh got a very interesting call from allen king though  hes getting files together on apex industries  all their shenanigans down in argentina  hes blowing the whistle  well fi gave him a uh  a talkingto  goody bags are going out to all the media types right now  so if i had stock in apex whew id sell  hey  brought some chicken soup for fi  dont worry i didnt make it  shes resting   mm  drink  yeah dont go easy on me  ran out of cigarettes on the way over  about that time mike  yeah mom do you think you can hang here for a while  the cavalry should be headed to the airport now   long story  whatever  you play nice boys  like new parents  spies take preventative measures  to ensure a safe environment  only instead of babyproofing cabinets  and electrical sockets  they use more extreme methods  when youre creating an explosion to keep people back  you cant go halfway  its never ideal but for their own protection  you have to make sure they know you mean business  then the only trick is to set it off without blowing anyone to kingdom come  yeah sam  mike ive been trying to get through for a half an hour  looks like our plan to sic the fbi on gilroy at the airport  is not gonna fly  a fuel truck crashed into a cessna on the runway  theyre rerouting flights all over florida  the cops have got this whole area blocked off  gilroys not hijacking a plane hes diverting it  yeah my guess is youre not stationed  at some passthrough in the sticks  im guarding gilroys landing strip  right and ill tell you what  the cops are birddogging a stray plane  theyre headed your way partner  they cross this bridge  gilroys gonna shred them with his 50 cal  hes gonna pick me up in a few minutes  youve got to tell them to stay back until he does  what you think the cops are gonna take my word for it mike  buenos dias mis amigos  westen  gilroy hearing lots of sirens over here  wouldnt have anything to do with a lost plane would it  this is why we rehearsed  stop your bellyaching and do your job  or ill do it for you  our guest is so keen to meet you  see you soon michael  gilroy we need to leave now  they say if you live long enough youll see everything  what happened  paid me 10 million  turns out his plan was to shoot me come after you  who  his name is simon  apparently im not his only friend in miami  sorry  did i mention im attached to an explosive device  perhaps you should run along
