make sure the money goes to the right place  go to hell  a rescue attempt is hard enough  when its someone who actually wants to be rescued  doesnt matter whether its a brother  with a compulsivegambling problem  or a girl who thinks  shes about to launch her modeling career  so you eliminate escape options   keep a low profile   but no matter what you do  youll still have someone screaming bloody murder  in the back of your car  bill dont worry weve got a plan  ill go with you i should be there  no listen to me  the best thing for you to do is stay at home  youll be the first one we call  talk to you soon  michael  is nate with you  no im just fixing his truck  whats wrong mom  he said he was going over to your apartment  to get his share of the money  what  hes going over to my place whats his cell number  nate doesnt have a cell they cut him off months ago  michael  nate  some situations just come down to probability  the chance that an assassin with a handgun  can hit you at 50 yards  the number of shots he can get off  might have a 1in5 chance of taking a bullet  maybe a 1in10 chance of dying  nate   or a 100 chance of getting blown away  by a shotgun wired to a door  a ricochet is usually not deadly  but it sure feels that way  michael  aah  where the hell is michael on one of your secret missions  dont look at me  your guys should be out pretty soon  last flight to dubai is in a couple hours  im ready oh no way  theres no way were gonna do this without mike  we dont have the manpower  we dont have a choice  i knew it you got no backbone  backbone you remember how this works  you hold off the guy in the front  i take the guy in the back mike takes jenna  whats missing from this picture  the guy that takes jenna  so ill take jenna  okay so who takes the guy in the front  nobody what happens then  people start shooting  we lose were dead  we win we got three bodies a traumatized girl  and spots on the fbis most wanted list  ive been on plenty of those lists  its not so bad  here they are lets do this  no we cant do it without mike  then ill do it myself  i got it honey  oh my back aah  what did you do  aah my back honey call 911  damn right im calling 911  you almost killed him  it was an accident  im sure the cops will sort it all out  jenna were not going to make the flight  any decent criminal will change his plans  at the mention of the word cops  dont worry jenna well catch a plane tomorrow  best we sort this out  hey you guys got a pen  we could start exchanging information  i assume you guys have insurance right  i dont think its necessary  for us to get the insurance companies involved  well i dont know pal i got hit pretty good  dont come looking for more  lets go back to the house  oh  hey its illegal to drive away from an accident  mike better have one hell of an excuse for not being here  aah  easy  spend a lot of time in countries without hospitals  you pick up a few things  take it easy  now make a small incision just above the wound  you want me to just dig in here or what  youre enjoying this way too much  disinfect the blade in the alcohol  and then run the lighter over the edge of the blade  god damn this is kind of fun  small incision  small incision aah  come on youd think i was pulling a goddamn cannonball  out of your shoulder  just a little more  god  okay okay  all right  there you go you big baby  jesus what happened  mike you get shot  theres cops all over out there  no it was just this gangbang driveby thing  its really nothing  what happened with jenna  shes still for sale  but we kept her from boarding the plane at least  gangbangers huh  what you join the crips or something  i mean mike look you dont want to tell me thats fine  but ill keep my mouth shut im your friend  im supposed to help you with crap like this  youve got to trust me  help me with my shirt  i do trust you sam  keeping you in the dark gives you deniability  yeah okay i know how it works  all right ill go out and help you with your cop problem  nice job nate  thanks for pulling that bullet out of me  oh yeah hey youre welcome mike no problem  hey nate how bout that money i owe you  jackass  nate  thank you  pay them back  hey hows your shoulder  patched up it hurts but it wasnt deep  glad to hear it  listen mike  i understand you got a situation but so do i  i mean im covering for you but if i lose my pension  youre gonna be changing my diapers  when im 95 and drooling  sam i would never let that happen  id smother you with a pillow first  promise me youre not gonna pick any fights in this place  its the only bar in miami that will let me run a tab  hi mom  its nate bills been hurt  you said you were going to get her  i didnt hear from you  so i went to the house  barely made it through the front gate  i thought you were my friend  im sorry something came up  i need to call the police  this was a bad idea  shell be on a plane within the hour  dont call we dont have time  i said ill take care of it and ill take care of it  what are you gonna do  same plan as before  just a different target  running an operation  you cant let personal feelings get in the way  its about planning and execution  you have to get out now now   not about being angry  come on lets go move it  wow this is really wellmade  open the door  out  piss me off  move whoa whoa  do you know who my brother is  i know who he is and i know what he does  get off me man youre making  although occasionally you may get a little angry  helping peoples not a bad gig bro  but if you want to make some real money  i could hook you up  did you pay them back these guys you owe  yeah  most of it  look theyre not gonna be visiting mom for a while  all right  think he suffocated  you ready to call your brother  let him know you want to go home  i think thats a yeah  i want my brother back how much  we dont want your money  which is not to say that we want you to have it  we want all your records  and all the money you made from all the girls you pimped  pimped im not a pimp  you say tomato i say pimp  you can keep whatever you made legally  from you know the photo studio  but the girls get the rest of it  what are you some kind of crusading cop  no unfortunately for you  im just some guy you managed to piss off  your brothers in a trunk of a car carl  hes eating on 10 bucks a day  thats a bag of chips a sandwich and a coke  tomorrow he eats on 5  and well be down to sugar packets by friday  and just so theres no misunderstanding  youre going to explain to jenna  exactly what was waiting for her  at the other end of that flight  i think that covers it  well wait for your call  you know  i think we could probably keep some of that money  for ourselves  its not like the girls are gonna miss it  what  they dont know how much there is  i met some of those girls at the party  some of them probably couldnt even count  there is a reason  family is always a good source of leverage  whether its a brother that always owes people money  or a brother stuck in the trunk of a car  you cant really turn your back on them  out  come on  walk walk  who are you  im a friend of your fathers  the drive home is often a grueling experience  for someone youve just rescued  especially if they were unaware of their situation  they ask a lot of questions  you fill them in on the answers  and then it dawns on them   the truth  it can be a little overwhelming  neat whats this  whats this huh  oh neat  what does this say here  anallphyl  how do you say that word jan  anaphylactic what does that word mean  cant breathe  oh you cant breathe  is this for when your throat closes up from allergies  like from pollen cause thats what i get  or maybe its the crushed peanuts  i sprinkled on your hot dog  yeah i talked to the chef at the hotel  seems like youre allergic to peanuts  well now that youve shot me  and i hold your life in my hands  i think its time we talked  no no no no dont dont  jan jan  after we talk you get this  i need to know what you know about my situation  dont know much  come on jan youre a pro you must have asked around  why was i burned who did this to me  come on jan  i need to know what you know  now would be the time to tell me  lot of people want you dead from old days  now you out  no one to protect  thats all  why was i burned  who did this to me jan  jan  sam you know tonis all american hot dog  down by the boardwalk  of course you do  get your fbi guys over there right away with an ambulance  if this doesnt get them off your ass  i dont know what will  take care of that shoulder well be in touch soon hugs and kisses your old friend  sam did the fbi pick jan up last night  yeah i dont think these guys get a lot of action  they were very excited to finally get their hands  on a former soviet bloc wet work guy  they were like kids on christmas  what did they get out of him i mean he tried to kill me  i assume hes gonna try and finish the job  yeah about that  i guess they never got a chance to talk to him  why is that  some guys came by in the middle of the night  and took him away  what guys  nobody knows  they walked in with some heavyduty clearances  took jan off the fbis hands and poof they were gone  word is they found jan hanging from his shoelaces  i mean who leaves a guy in a holding cell  with shoelaces right  anyway theyre calling it a suicide  michael  yeah  do you know whats going on  looks like whoever burned me has something planned  they dont want me leaving miami  but they dont want me dead either  do you know why
