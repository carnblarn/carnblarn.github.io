                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until    we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted     when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit nojob history   youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way   you rely on anyone whos still talking to you     a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fb i  you know spies bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  hey is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere     one of the reasons surveillance is done in teams  is that its exhausting  sitting in a car remaining constantly alert while you watch a mailbox  will knock you out like a handful of sleeping pills  doing it in shifts is the only way to make sure you dont miss something   your turn  what  oh     five minutes five minutes your eyeballs are tired  you should be happy im still here  four hours parked in a hot car  cause this may be the post office box used by one of the people who burned you  carlas not just one of the people who burned me shes all ive got  are you sure the manager said today  he said mail for this box is picked up every wednesday  did i tell you that i despise surveillance  only every time we do it   oh here we go   if thats carla thats one hell of a disguise  carlas not the type to collect her own mail   tailing a trained operative  requires a number of timeconsuming preparations  everything from acquiring a vehicle they cant recognize or trace  to familiarizing yourself with all the local traffic patterns   go ahead turn the car on   turn it on there you go    now put it in drive drive yes   of course since you can never be sure whos a trained op  theres always the chance youll take all those precautions  just to follow a secretary back to her cubicle   thats carlas building no guards no cameras  you really think carla would work out of there  security comes in all shapes and sizes fi     hungry   covert security is designed to blend in  people you never notice until you see them in action  that means you have two choices you can sit and wait for an incident to occur   or you can create your own incident     hello   yo bro got your grub im out front  all right ill come down and meet you in the lobby but you cant park there   this okay  no man thats even worse   oh man you gotta be kiddinme  whoa whoa whoa where you goin go back  dude dude you arejust asking for a ticket parking there  you know what buddy i really dont have time for this   hey sorry man im just trying to help you know what  just pull around the back go down the alley ill meet you there    fine just make it quick       i think we found carla   hey mikey  ooh ooh ooh look at that that looks good mmm  so i pulled the building records and lease docs for that address you gave me  carlas little irrigation consulting company   anything good  mmhmm  office is right there second floor east end  but its gonna be tough getting in there unseen  need to find if their security has a routine maybe theres a chink in the armor  wireless webcam might get what you need but you gotta figure out a way to get it in place  think you can find a setup with a strong enough signal  i dont know maybe later today if i have time   nice watch sam  thank you its a panerai ferrari version  i think they prefer to call em timepieces  anyway veronica got us his and hers for our anniversary  well apparently its been a whole month since we both said i love you   for that you get an 8000 watch  and some other things   you michael  no   cause they said this guy michael lives around here  lot of people live around here  they say he drive a black car too dodge   whos they  look man im not trying to bother you its just that  all right heres the deal li just got out of prison a couple months ago  i had a cell mate said he had a pretty sweet scam goin on cops couldnt touch him  this guy michael comes along blows his whole operation up  thats the kind of friend i need names trevor  you got the wrong guy   at least hear my problem  sorry  wait man     go home  please   sixty seconds go  okay all right uh  okay i got a reputation in certain circles as a expediter of getaway   wheel man  i do more than that  i find the right car modify it as necessary  get rid of it clean plus i plan the escape route   youre an expediter  no i used to be  last time i was in prison i saw the light i decided to turn my life around  i got my ged i got certified as a mechanic now im tryin to stay clean no matter what   thirty seconds  problem is i got this boss named timo   he runs this crew that i used to work with a few times  pick it up  theyre planning a jewel heist thats going down during this trade show thats coming up   tell him you cant do it  i did i even offered to find him a replacement  the thing is timo likes to work with the same people he knows especially during big jobs  he told me he would feel personally betrayed   if i didnt come through with this  im sure hell get over it  you dont know timo thats his way of saying do it or die   can you leave town for a while  not without violating my parole  i gotta stay in the state for the next five months  times up you have two options   go to the police tell them everything you just told me  timo will kill my family   they have witness protection  yeah right  or you do thejob dont get caught either way i cant help you  i got emeralds man these are real  you can get 15 grand easy and its clean i got a twocarat diamond ring  trevor i heard you out now you need to walk away  i got a son man he was born while i was locked up   im sorry to hear that  i dont want you to be sorry  i just want you to understand where im coming from  i made a promise to my boy that i was done with that life  and i aint breakin that promise  come on   criminal hideouts tend to be pretty nondescript  underground caves and spooky old mansions are dramatic  but a boathouse on the keys is easier to find   well your boy trevor hes running with some pretty impressive company  i mean every name he gave you firstround pick if you were draftinyour own crew   whatd he say the job was  he didnt  he knows its jewels but he doesnt know where or when  this guy timo likes to keep details to himself   here we go    cj mr slickster from jersey  arrested up and down the east coast  fraud embezzlement nothinrecent  now this big guy is the safecracker  gilbert kessler one of the best   any record  well he rung up three dui s in the last two years  so technically hes not even supposed to be drivin  okay heres a doozy kandi originally from california  assault and battery assault and battery   assault with a deadly weapon  her and fiona would have a good time or you know kill each other  oh and this must be timo   suspect in most of the bigger unsolved heists in the greater miami area  only arrested once    and  the only witness was murdered    so you got a plan yet  the best way to help trevor is to get the job called off   but you dont even know what it is  im hoping that wont matter   hows that  a crew like this runs like a welloiled machine  somebody gets in trouble with the police that machine stops working  im tellin you i think this safecracker gilbert could be your guy   his probation has a nodrinking restriction    so you get him pulled over after one beer its jail time  fi uh would you like to make a new friend  hes a safecracker im hoping you can convince him to have a drink with you  goodlooking guy     is this seat taken  no uh sit down   bring us your best champagne  sure   fifi  gilbert   its nice to meet you  my pleasure   ah   here you go   somebody has to toast with me  what are you celebratin  why you and me of course  i get it   this is a sales pitch youre an escort    well i dont drink and i dont pay to play either enjoy the champagne   when youre looking to get somebody arrested  bad guys cant always be counted on to commit crimes on your schedule      sometimes you have to give them a little push     the hell are you doin  thats my table  ive been waitinfor an hour for my special table    what  dont you what me get your ass outta here   dont touch me buddy  well i just did  there i go again and again and a   once youve got a crime in progress  you can let the authorities take over    hey    i just hit my funny bone and no one cares    that assumes of course  that the authorities are paying attention  yeah is that the best you got huh come on   come on big guy show me somethin  so you want a lot more   i just hit my funny bone and no one cares     come on you fight like a girl   really  now whoa hey hey   that feel like a girl     like that     police somebody   hes killing this man   okay  timo called gilberts in jail but the jobs still on  trevor you said iftimo lost his safecracker the job would be off   i know any other time he wouldve called it off  what did he say  he said hed been workin this angle for the last two years  and it was too big a score to let gilbert ruin it  hes tryin to track down some guy from georgia  here im thinkin if i do the right thing i might catch a break who was i foolin   theres another way we can get the job called off  how  find out the target tip em off   timos already on edge i start asking questions now  no no no no  you stay focused on making timo think youre a team player   ill ask the questions  wait what  taking gilbert out didnt get the job called off but it did create a job opening  now you call timo you tell him that you found a safecracker whos local   who you  yeah   you crack safes cause timos not gonna take my word for it  just just make the call  tell him ill meet him tomorrow ive got some things to do tonight     you cant stop a door alarm from going off     but you can explain it  leave a few cigarette butts on the ground  and anybody coming by will assume someone was just sneaking a smoke break  im on the roof across from carlas building sam are you ready  give me one second here    used to require a full team of operatives  these days you can get by with a webcam and wireless signal booster  from your local electronics store  ideally youd drill holes and mount it on brackets  but when time is an issue i prefer dental putty  easy to mix easy to apply and as strong as cement when it hardens   but it hardens quick  hows it lookin sam  so you better aim right the first time  hello carla  were in business mikey you gettinout clean     sounds like building securitys getting curious  ill call you back        making yourself invisible when you need to  is a crucial skill for a covert operative  it sounds exotic but its not like  theres a supersecret move they teach you at spy school  that allows you to vanish into thin air  often its just a matter of quick thinking fast feet and strong fingers   hey mikey hurry up i got good news   good news i could use some good news  i think i found a gap in the security at carlas building  im tellin you mikey sometimes i surprise myself its beautiful  i did some editing on the surveillance tape check this out  i timelapsed the footage here just to see if theres any kind of a routine  but the maintenance man and the gardener dont really have one  they patrol in random intervals so the best you could do is guess   waitin for the good part sam  comin  okay about 345 night security gets there  and before they switch over everyone goes around back for about five minutes  im guessin for some kind of debrief  during that time the only guy watchin the front  is the old man at the coffee shop  still waitin for the good news sam  because grandpa cant walk the place like he works there  anytime somebody heads down that side alley  he takes a little stroll and that is our window   nice work sam  thanks mike id love to bask in the glory  but i got my big onemonthsincewesaid i love you celebration  sammys gettin some hammy tonight    i keep pinching myself to make sure im not dreaming   i just cant believe how happy i am     we are on a nice little roll here  its like ive waited for you to show up for my entire life  and now i finally    i sound like such a teenager    well youve got the body of a teenager you you might as well sound like one  you are so sweet and you make me feel so good  hey pumpkin you know this isnt just a oneway street  look ive been all over the world  ive known a lot of women  so when i tell you without a doubt you are one in a million   you can believe it ronnie  sam  marry me    how about that huh theres a question     safecracking skills are a basic part of espionage training  spies steal secrets and people keep their secrets in safes  but staying current with safecracking  is a little like staying current with computers  new model every year  bottom line if you wanna breach a safe you have to practice    fi  i was one number away from the combination  the last ones always the same c4  its always easier to just blow it   you really think hes gonna test you  probably hes a control freak  at the very least i need to make it sound good  oh youve been out of the game a while michael there are all kinds of new toys nowadays  that looks like it would leave a mess  youre such a snob when it comes to manipulation techniques  on a real heist theyre overrated and impractical   you dont like it because it takes patience  i wont deny that i prefer   a power tool       hello yeah trev   just let me know when    timo is ready to meet     a criminal cover i d  isntjust about a new name and phone number  its about fitting into a culture with its own rules and hierarchies  its a world where bank robbers are the rock stars  con artists are the snobs car thieves are the bluecollar guys  and safecrackers are the artists   i usually work for safe companies you know  when grandma forgets the combination  or the bank manager forgets the security code  they call the best   how often do you freelance  two or three jobs a year based on timing and pay  surprised i havent heard of you  i take great pains not to be heard of  so whats this safe were lookinto compromise   youll have to bear with me joe  joseph  oh excuse me joseph now im sure you have questions  and youll get answers but not yet  i dont usually work with people i dont know so how about we get to know each other huh  come on    hey help you   you just quit  yeah   no cameras to worry about   ooh  im outta here man     crack it   no  excuse me  if youre looking for a guy to crack a liquor store safe im not your man   indulge me    youre gonna youre gonna shoot me  last time i checked you needed a safecracker  you know what  trevor vouched for you  crack it now or he dies  come on i want us all to be friends   crack the safe now    you wanna see a show i need a cup   lets go   anytime you recommend a friend for a job  youre on the hook if things dont work out  in the retail sales business for example make a bad referral and you might get fired  in the armed robbery business on the other hand     make a bad referral and you might get killed  you look a little jumpy trevor youre not nervous are you  no  so you really really have to hope  that the new guy knows what hes doing   happy  nice  be at this address 300  dont touch that  dont touch anything   you know trevor you already met kandi this is cj  welcome to the family joseph  answer by the third ring no matter what no excuses  i dont care if youre in the shower you answer  now sit down were gonna go over a few things well be coming in from here    are we breaking in  no man sweeter than that  your concern for secrecy is admirable but i need to know if therell be people there   well handle it  and where will this affair be taking place   youll find out soon enough  let me put it another way   if someone screams will they be heard  well let me put it this way  ive covered every aspect of this plan down to the smallest detail  all you need to worry about is cracking the safe   fine tell me about the safe  madison ak series class two composite  composite hard plate and the lock   ilco 693  manual combination thats good  youll have 19 minutes  nineteen minutes hmm well its doable ill need to know other variables though  i already told you well cover it lets move on  not so fast question  no no more questions you know what you need to know now shut up and listen  really smart guy then when was it installed cause as you know  ilco implements countermeasures every year to stop people like me  so if i have 19 minutes i will need to know what version im dealing with  it was put in two years ago  great now we can move on  this meeting is over everybody out  trevor you can stay      trevor  whats up   youre not answering your phone  damn it   oh i hope timo didnt call i forgot to turn it back on  whyd he hold you back  i thought i was in trouble he just wanted to give me a scatter point  timo gives me the location i park the vehicles for the crew nearby  anything goes wrong we take separate routes back to the boathouse   so the heist must be close by  three jobs ive done with timo  hes always given me the location within a half a mile of the place were hitting  this might be all the info we need    to find the target  maybe  the vault timo wants to hit is very highend  outside of banks not a lot of buildings would have one   those things are damn near indestructible  so the city makes you get a special permit to put one in  knowing when it was installed would narrow it way down  we can get it down to a halfmile radius  i can give you something by tomorrow  youll know who to tip offby tomorrow so i dont have to get the backup vehicles   no you need to act business as usual until its over   right    come on go  id better get back there   so mikey uh you never asked me about my date  oh howd your date go   not real good  im sorry to hear that  she popped the question buddy   the marriage question  yeah you know it   and you said  i didnt thats part of the problem   shes freakin out waiting for an answer  so give her one  well id love to mike but there are some issues here   do you love her   she could be the one   then say yes  but its complicated  then say no  youre a true friend mikey   you finish placin the cars  yeah dropped timos car off around the corner  that the target   so now we tip em off  we have a little snag   what  see for yourself    cj  apparently hes obtained gainful employment   hes timos inside man at thejewelry exchange  oh man  if were not careful about who we talk to and how timos gonna know that he has a leak  his first guess is gonna be me or you either way its bad for you    so thats it im screwed  no were still gonna tip off the store  wejust have to find a way to do it without cj knowing  ill deal with this ill let you know when its done   go ahead      thank you sir  five bucks buddy  what hey   wow   all set  yeah told him to make the block once and head down the alley  then mike can make his move on carlas building    fi i need some advice  tryin to come up with a gift  something that says i love you but i cant marry you  and not too expensive  theres no such thing sam why cant you marry her   well theres stuff involved  stuff   grownup stuff okay you wouldnt understand  oh  its obvious how much you care for her   im not sayin i dont  then why cant you marry her  because its against the law all right  im already married technically  youre gonna get flies in there  look it was the 70s i did it on a whim  we both knew the next day it was a big mistake but we never got around to gettin divorced   thats not something you get around to sam  look fi  the truth is i didnt think any of it mattered cause i wasnt the marrying type   until now    forget about the gift sam just tell veronica the truth shell understand  we all have skeletons terrible terrible skeletons   here comes our boy  and the old guy gets up  goes to check on the alley  and in you go mikey       im in the shower   you have 30 minutes to get here        hey hey wheres he goin hes gonna blow it       mike what happened you were clear  timo called he wants me at the boathouse  well deal with carlas building later  sam i think im gonna need some backup   whats goin on  put those on  no more questions get dressed get your gear get in the van    im not doin this  calm down   you cant run  the hell i cant   dont be stupid youll go back to prison for violating parole  i made a promise  you know what your boy needs more than a promise he needs his dad  now let me handle this and when im done youll never have to worry about timo again  trust me   you okay   yeah  need to get rid of this  where you goin  to relieve myself why you wanna watch   you better give me your phone  what  we take nothing traceable   sending messages in the middle of an operation  is among the most dangerous things you can do  sometimes you just have to drop a note  and hope your backup team is paying attention       theyre doin the heist now we dont have much time  i was wondering when the fun would start     yeah  monteiro heating  air   finally tell em to hurry up    all right  whoa    took you long enough  hey you gotta sign    where to  its right this way  yep right here      move it get going   lets go move it lets go  come on lets go get in there   get your ass down here move      okay  get in there come on  lets go  nineteen minutes           whats goin on  are we in   five more minutes  we dont have five minutes  all right pack up were getting outta here  come on lets go lets go everybody out  i want back in base everybody back in base  do not be late you got 33 minutes i want the place cleaned out torched  timo i got rd x i can blow the lock like you said its the score of a lifetime  its too late two more minutes and we all go to jail now lets go               you missed something you had to   this is not on me my information was good    you said no panic button and no alarm on the safe  and i was right   then how did the alarm go off    i dont know  exactly    hey whats goin on   you can take care of yourself  why are you guys so serious whats goin on   we put too much into this job to walk away with nothing  what do you mean nothing  i got the stuff it was in the bag i gave it to timo   the jewels were in that bag  yeah wheres timo   trevor  he should be here i gave him the quickest route   a certain kind ofleader  insists on controlling every aspect of an operation    so that nothing can possibly go wrong       the downside to insisting on controlling everything  is that when something bad happens  people tend to think it was all part of your plan     he set us up  you son of a  what did you get me into im gonna find timo and im gonna kill him   im gonna kill him  but hell be dead long before you find him        where you headed  geez kandi what happened  you tell me  i dont know maybe somebody got onto us maybe cj screwed it up  what the hell are you doing here we cant be seen together when a job is blown   had to make sure you were okay  no  no you get somewhere and you stay there until you hear from me  what about the jewels  what jewels what are you talkin about we didnt get anything  oh whoa what are you crazy   i will count to three  kandi   one  whats wrong baby   two  no no   three      sorry about the shiner i had to sell it  small price to pay  think im really done hearin from timo  you know kandi better than i do  thanks for everything michael  and im gonna be back tomorrow with that bracelet   and some jewels for your friends too  no no that is not necessary  hey ill be back tomorrow  hey trevor we didnt actually steal anything  so the promise that you made  yeah   hmm thanks man   lets go  almost done  why the rush michael  you know the window for getting into carlas building doesnt open for over an hour   i dont wanna take any chances  you really think youre gonna find something in that office  no idea maybe ill hit the jackpot find out her real name and social security number  or might find out what kind of staples she likes  either way thats more than what i have now   you mean nothing  exactly lets go  five more minutes theyll be dry   now youre gonna have to do em all over again lets go     hey mike  hey sam uh whats with the bags  oh well um my little confession to veronica didnt go over so well  she kicked me out mike mmhmm  out of her place and out of her life  thanks for the advice fi  thats really sad sam  but we cant talk about it right now cause were in such a rush right michael  who wants a beer   carlas boys out of sight  everybody but the guy in the coffee shop  thats your decoy  he thinks were having a rendezvous in the alley   youre welcome  back in a few fi     michael nice try  your dayjob does get in the way doesnt it   when you work in intelligence  theres no bigger slap in the face  than a picture of yourself in the middle of an operation  it sends a clear message were one step ahead of you were in control we own you  mylar balloons and a bottle of champagne thats just twisting the knife
