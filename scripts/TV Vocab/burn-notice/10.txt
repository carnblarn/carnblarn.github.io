                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until   we got a burn notice  youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i   miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend   should we shoot them   an old friend whos informing on you to the fbi    you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls   family too   is that your mom again   if youre desperate someone needs your help  bottom line  until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere  what do you think of these shoes michael  fantastic  i have just the right dress  are they real  well they look real isnt that what counts  youre getting a fake identity michael  i cant get fake shoes  the place is up here somewhere  you know you go ahead  im gonna  oh thats pretty  a fake identity is known in the spy trade  as a false flag  it used to be you could make your own documents  with a printer and a laminator  these days though  i d s have magnetic strips holograms  and infrared watermarks  you need a pro  yes what can i do for you  i lost my passport and drivers license  i heard i could get some new ones here  all you got to do is report them stolen  theyll send you replacements  right but the thing is  im going on a trip soon  and i heard you could do it here  more quickly and more quietly  hmm  that might be possible  for a fee  the fee is not an issue  come on back  i dont get much call for the good stuff anymore  most of my business is just teenagers  trying to get past a bouncer at the titty bar  titty bar  they got no appreciation for art you know  give me your right hand  how about pulling your sleeve back  if this stuff gets on your shirt itll never come out  and slide these on for me if you dont mind  this is you isnt it  uh kind of hard to tell from here  put those on for me if you dont mind  in some situations a tactical retreat is your best option  listen well im sorry as i can be about this  but a guy like me dont stay in business very long  unless he slips the fbi a bone every now and then  and lets face it  youre a big old soup bone  flattered  they come through every now and then asking about you  a guy with a gun is a guy with a gun  you can fight him and risk someone getting shot  or wait for backup  youre gonna be my getnohasslesforayear card  yeah special agent allerot  yeah tell him its jumbo  well how many jumbos you think he knows  mike look at the deal i got on these shoes  youre not gonna believe it  lady lady you cant be back here  get out of here get out of here now  sorry i just wanted to show my boyfriend  get out of here now  shes pregnant  pregnant it worked  where are you going my shoe  they clashed with my dress anyway  you know i was thinking   we could do some vacationy things  when we go to d c you know  make the most of our trip  wheres my lockpicks at  you know maybe a fancy dinner one night  take in some of the sights  im gonna confront a man who tried to have me killed  its not a weekend getaway  we can mix business with pleasure  it was right here  fi the thing about d c   is that youre going to need backup  dont tell me youd rather have sam  we cant talk about this right now why not  because i have a hard time focusing when im in handcuffs  would this help  another fine illustration  of your need for tactical assistance  admit it michael  you need me  you dont even have your own hairpin  i do now you happy  well yeah i know a few guys who do i d work mike  but you know the feds are gonna be all over them too  especially now  feel them out for me will you  mike they said if you leave miami  theyre gonna pick you up  in d c theres gonna be someone there  who is gonna recognize you  the best fake i d in the world isnt gonna change that  the guy that burned me tried to have me killed  as long as im in miami he can find me  ill take my chances in d c  you know who might be able to help is lucy  she called a while back with a job  but you were pretty busy  with this whole burnnotice business you know  whats the job  well i dont know the details but i do know  that she works with some real artistes  these are the guys  who can give you a whole new life to go with your i d  you interested  lets give her a call  corporations need spies just like governments do  of course theyre not called spies  theyre called security consultants  theyre basically mercenaries with nice suits  your offices just keep getting better and better  its good to see you michael  what have you been up to  a little of this a little of that  havent you been getting your reports from your fbi buddies  i didnt tell them  anything they couldnt find out for themselves  if you tell them  they dont have to find out for themselves do they  uh i   you were the one that trained me  in the delicate art of giving people useless information  i said nice things for what its worth  thank you you have a job for me  a woman i met evelyn  she heard i work security  she asked me for help  i guess her ex ran off with their son  we ran checks credit cards airlines got nothing  somebodys gonna have to do some legwork  but a job that small  not really our thing  you thought of me  i would consider it a favor if you took the job  and the moneys not bad  moneys not the pressing issue  why what do you need  identity  not for traveling  michael if you leave miami  i cant help you with that kind of thing  seriously  lucy  lucy  fine  get your documents together  ill have my guys do an i d package  go see evelyn first  thanks  i separated from doug a few months ago  i tried to keep it together for jaspers sake  thats our son  but it was hard on him listening to us fight all the time  he started acting up at school and then doug turned on him  and i wasnt gonna let that happen  im sure you made the right decision  he took him  he picked him up early at school one day and he disappeared  did you call the police  yeah every day  but technically were still married  and hes jaspers father  so without a custody order i cant do anything  please i cannot wait for the courts to sort this out  do you have any idea where he might have taken him  none  i have no idea because ive hardly spoken to him in months  do you have pictures  yeah  here thats jasper  please lucy said you could find him  i need to know that hes okay i want him back  im gonna find him  one of the things you learn in training  is to avoid situations that cut too close  if you had a rough childhood  a situation with an abusive father and a vulnerable kid  is gonna make you angry  that can be motivating but it can also be dangerous  well shes a looker whats the story  husband ran off with her kid  you all right mike  im gonna find this guy  facts are the hallmark of a good false identity  its harder to create history than it is to alter it  plus the more truth to your lie  the easier it is to remember  i dont see you for weeks  and you start going through the closets  what are you looking for  where is that box you used to keep all my stuff in  the memory box sounds about right  i dont remember  im kidding excuse me  oh god look huh first place  god the trophy was bigger than you were  could we speed this up ma  i need my medical records and my birth certificate  all right  oh how about your report card huh  you could have been valedictorian  if you hadnt been suspended so many times  for getting into fights  mom i dont need my report card  your father used to get so angry  i dont want to talk about dad ma  i just need my stuff fine here  i dont want you to think youre keeping those  no im just gonna make copies  im gonna take a trip  work  the last time you said that you left for 10 years michael  its not that kind  did you ever think about leaving mom  what  did it ever get bad enough with dad  that you thought about leaving  of course i did  i wanted to keep the family together michael  through the good and the bad  you kids were so cute  sam well its like lucy said  chances are hes probably still in the area  theres no recent creditcard activity no car rentals  the only blip mike is where he works   greenway worldwide cargo off of 57th  i talked to my atf buddy  theres some kind of investigation there  some link to organized crime  great  u s attorneys office is all over it  i left a message havent heard back and thats about it  i should go talk to evelyn  you just talked to her mike  yeah but she was a little flustered the last time  she might have forgotten something  i thought you had to get those documents  to lucy for your fake i d  yeah ill do it later  something i should know sam  about what fi  about why michaels acting this way  what way he seems fine to me  tell me about this new client  you know i just remembered  ive got to get mike some yogurt  cause if i dont do that boy you know how he is  he never mentioned trouble at work  do you think there could be a connection  could be you hear atf investigation it raises flags  i wish i could be more helpful  sorry  i think you should just focus on getting your son back  thats the best way to deal with it  evelyn i think youre stronger than you realize  then maybe i should have just stuck with it  you know what would have happened  if i had pretended that everything was all right  but i didnt want my family to be a lie  not for jasper and not for me  youre doing the best thing  believe me i know a little something about this  ive stayed and ive left  sometimes leaving is what you have to do  it must be lonely what you do  i couldnt live that way  in my line of work  i cant allow myself to get too close  what if you met someone   and theres a spark  would you ignore it  could you  i would uh   concentrate on getting the job done  i got to head over to dougs  ill call you as soon as i know anything  okay  whats taking so long sam are you losing your touch  i didnt know doug would have a ninepin dimple lock   you know the new kind the kind i havent practiced on  okay my fingers are bleeding now  theres some pain involved  you know this is the only place around here  with bars on its windows  i wonder what doug was so worried about  come on baby  there better be something good in here  there we go got it  looks like he didnt leave much  ive worked with less  check for bills  bunch of junk mail magazines  hello  hey heres a quiz  it tells you how to pick your mate based on what you eat  okay mike whats your favorite meat  pleasure reading later sam  oh youre no fun  mike two guys with guns coming fast  they must have been watching the house  theyve got the back covered  aah nothing  just because there are no windows or doors  doesnt mean there are no exits  the thing to look for is an airconditioner unit  thats where the wall is weakest  also people watch doors  they dont watch air conditioners  oh the damsel in distress  she said it was an emergency what do you want me to do  be her knight in shining armor of course  evelyn this is fiona  we work together  fiona thank you pleasure  evelyn  what happened  i went to the courthouse  to try to get an emergency custody hearing  some guys were at my car they knocked me down  how many men were there  two i think  you think  could there have been more  probably the same guys that came by dougs place  michael if jaspers caught up in the middle of this  i will never forgive myself  please youve got to bring him home  its all right now its okay  im sorry  its all right  its okay  what happened to the trademark westen emotional distance  she was upset  obviously wheres your head at  fi if youre gonna help me  you cant have this attitude  attitude  if youre gonna be like this i think im entitled  maybe i should do this one alone then maybe you should  ill drive you home  ill get there myself  okay mike  tell me im a genius  youre a genius  come on you can do better than that  remember the mail we were sorting at dougs place   outdoor life field  stream  it got me thinking  outdoor types always go back to the woods  so i got ahold of a buddy of mine hes at the coast guard  he knows a guy in park service and i said  theres a couple of bottles of patr_n in it for you  just tell me sam  state parks has a record of dougs license plate  at mangrove campground  keys yeah  id go there with you  but veronica sort of set up a mini vacation in boca   one of those swimmingwiththedolphins   ill take care of it sam  i cant believe that you found him so quickly  thats amazing  my friend sam may have bruised  a couple of federal statutes along the way  but nothing a bottle of tequila cant smooth over  well he wont get in trouble  we found him thats whats important  i knew i could count on you  is that loaded  yeah  youre not gonna bring that when you go get jasper right  itll be fine trust me  this is it  what do we do now  i dont want anybody getting hurt  no matter what you see  stay in the car until i say  okay  thank you  wheres your son wheres jasper  look this is about me  ill do whatever you want just dont go after my son  you people killed my wife  isnt that enough  the basic rule of covert ops  is let someone else do your dirty work  let someone else find the guy you want to kill  its a great technique  as long as youre not the someone else  evelyn the assassin  doug the new client  wheres your son  what you come here to kill me   im not here to kill you  that woman out there is  whos she  i need you to stay away from the windows  where is your son hes not here  i sent him to stay with friends  that is one thing that has gone right today  my name is michael and im here to help you  evelyn everything all right in there michael  doug what is she doing  michael shell wait for us to make a move  and pick us off when we do  i need a screwdriver  shouldnt we call the park rangers  unless the park rangers have been issued  body armor and highcaliber weapons  were on our own here  she must have disabled my gun when we stopped for gas  remove the triggerbar spring from a sig sauer p228  and youve got a 9millimeter semiautomatic doorstop  i dont know what you think youre playing at  but this is not a game you can win  doug i need a paper clip do you have one  i dont have a paper clip  well do you have something like a paper clip   a thin piece of metal   wait never mind  kill him yourself if you want  we need to wrap this thing up  you fixed it  hardly i might get one shot off  you have one chance to shoot her  im not gonna shoot her  wait  is she leaving  i seriously doubt that  do you have any duct tape  hold that there  when i saynow youre gonna open that door  now  shoot a propane tank  and youll just get a big pot of cold gas  you need an open flame and real good aim  get down  yeah sam i had to drive around  make sure we werent followed  she could be anywhere now got to go  whats happening  well get to that  i need to know why someone wants you dead  its a long story  well its a long story  that starts with greenway cargo right  give me the short version for now  i was the controller   mostly wrote checks did invoices  it was a job ive been a cpa for 15 years  need to get to the markedfordeath part  after a while  i realized i was paying vendors i had never heard of  for cargo that was never delivered  front companies  they were into all kinds of stuff   weapons ivory human cargo  thats what the fbi said  anyway they came to my house  said they were investigating the company investigating me  unless you testify  i didnt want to get involved but they said id go to jail  i said id think about it  then things started happening  things what things  i had people following me  phone calls guys watching my house  then my wife    goes out in my car  they said it was an accident  but i sent jasper away and i ran  who are they  theyre your new best friends stay here  ha well what a piece of work she is  so evelyn used you to do the grunt work  to track him down  she shows up and finishes the job  and when she kills him everyone comes looking for you  she seemed so nice  mike she went through lucy to get to you  yeah call lucy evelyns not the type to leave loose ends  right oh almost forgot thats for you  evelyn has the charger  yeah its gonna need some work  and your gun  removed the triggerbar spring  oh that sounds like something you would do  you guys do really have a lot in common dont you  look fi i know youre enjoying this  but nows not the time to say i told you so   this isnt like you michael  i know  fiona i need your help  oh so youre not gonna handle this one on your own  you just couldnt help yourself could you  sadly no  take doug back to the loft lock him down tight  you can handle that right  have i ever let you down  be careful fi  dont worry michael i never let my guard down  what the hell do you mean you cant get ahold of her  she doesnt have some kind of a   yeah all right well keep trying  mike shes in some kind of a meeting with a new client  that just called this morning  i mean it might be nothing  its not gonna be nothing sam  hello  evelyn michael if i had known  you were this much fun to work with  i would have come to miami sooner  im glad one of us is having fun  youre not missing the damsel in distress are you  michael my son im afraid  please michael  you changed  this is more my style  oh for crying out loud im not gonna shoot you here  besides i need you  youre the one whos going to tell me where doug is  oh here  your car is in the campground parking lot  what are we gonna do to resolve our problem  well i think our problems are a little different  but yes lets resolve them  you know you and i have a very special connection  im not even sure who im talking to  oh we met in a manner of speaking   istanbul about six years ago  july seven years ago   you took out those two diplomats  yes you know how close you came to catching me  now that was impressive  and ever since then ive kept tabs on you  you might say ive become a fan  i heard you got burned and got this gig in miami  so the stars just kind of lined up  i like the new look and your bruise it healed  yeah well that was temporary  ive been studying up on you  its not easy with someone as secretive as you are  but of course things got a lot easier when you got burned  youre not classified material anymore  lucky you  cause i learned something about your early years  your daddy was mean hmm  so i figured an abusive husband  and a troubled but gifted son   well that would be motivating  enough about me  lets talk about you  no i dont feel like it  you know i dont think  that we should waste all your hard work  what say we split the fee  you just tell me where he is i will do all the rest  its easy money  evelyn i appreciate all the effort youve put into this  but there comes a time where you have to walk away  come on  isnt there something i can do to persuade you  theres nothing you can do  you know what i love about miami  apart from you of course  the cheap labor  you know i can get a kid off the street  to do a hit for about a grand  well if i flirt with him a little  say now isnt that lucy  lucy  michael i am so sorry  its not your fault yes it is  you taught me better than that  im so stupid i should have been more thorough  ive got guys headed to her hotel right now it wont matter  i know i just feel like i should do something  you should  you should be careful because shes still out there  right on time  yeah  evelyn change your mind  enough of this  you want a deal you deal with me  you leave lucy out of it  done lucy has no more to fear from me  you see i can be reasonable  of course i still have a job to do  and the next target will have to be sam or fiona or   or  i know  mommy  sooner or later ill find someone  you care about more than doug  so you call me when you want it to stop  shes not leaving town is she  that would be a no  doug if she knows all this about you  shell probably come here  she wont play this out on my turf  shell keep the pressure on until she gets an opening  i cant believe this  im a cpa for christs sake  a cpa brought down al capone  theres a reason why the feds want you to testify  i say we hunt her down  ammunitions cheap  fi if we go out there without a plan were exposed  shes more than happy to keep killing people  until we hand doug over  she can come after me  im ready  yeah  what about sam  im game mike  what about if she comes after my mom  my brother dougs son jasper  so we just sit here and wait  for once shes right mike  weve got to do something  were gonna hand him over to the u s attorney  get him into witness protection  wont she still come after you  well deal with that later  sam i need you to call the u s attorney  tell them were bringing doug in tomorrow morning  im on it  and somebody needs to go to my mom  see that shes safe make her house secure  you think shes cooked dinner yet  im sure shell heat something up for you sam  well then im on that too  fi i need you to prep an armed escort  doug i need you to stay away from the windows  you say this is just a precaution  oh yeah its nothing to worry about  um say this is a little embarrassing  but me and my lady friend had a falling out  and well like mike thought maybe it would be okay  if i crashed here for the night  sam im not an idiot  you want to tell me whats going on  well see there was this lady  and she was making some threats  against me  not specifically  i mean your name came up  but it was more like a hypotheticaltype thing  so its nothing to worry about  but mike wanted me to stay here  and give you some selfdefense pointers  in case i had to leave  you gonna leave this here when you go  okay be careful okay because thats loaded  yeah  michaels father had a winchester singleshot  i think i may still have it  so you want a beer  you kidding  doug is sleeping peacefully  you gave him something maybe  well half of something  sam got in touch  with his buddy at the u s attorneys  were bringing doug in tomorrow morning  great we can talk finally  theres nothing to talk about  you were right i was wrong im sorry  it isnt that simple michael  you think you can let the job be who you are   all you are   and you cant  its dangerous to think that you can  i know i can be  passionate  but im good at what i do  i know  its no secret that things between us have been   a little rocky  it isnt easy for me either  evelyn comes along  and shes attractive sweet needy  dont deny it michael  fine  isnt it interesting that she turned out to be   who she turned out to be  what shall we make of that  you made your point fi  did i yep you did  what about d c you still going  i have to  if i dont it wont be long  before cowan sends someone else down here to kill me  i need him to know that i can get to him too  and i need him to know that right now  and you need help and you know it  i dont think thats a good idea  is that a tactical judgment or a personal one  both  everybody i know is in danger right now  everyone im close to  well   im willing to risk it   if you are  hows my mom  locked up cozy with a cigarette and a shotgun  ready to kill anything that comes through the door  here you go doug  my lucky vest  it will look great over my shirt  thanks  its a little worn but it will do the trick  are these bullet holes  yeah i broke it in for you  its a short ride to the u s attorneys office  just think of it as a precaution like a seat belt  a seat belt that smells like old spice and bourbon easy now  assassination is 1 shooting  99 preparation   anticipating moves  devising approaches recruiting sources  finding the perfect opportunity  so the bullets almost an afterthought  usually thats when a target is on the move   when there are too many variables to control them all  we should get out of here  michael whatever happens thank you  yeah you can thank me  by keeping your head down and staying away from windows okay  there are ways to lessen the risk    an armed escort  taking an unpredictable route to your destination  having backup in a trail car  but ultimately  as long as the assassin knows where youre going  they have the upper hand  the point is the thing works  its one of the few things in my life thats never let me down  its impossible to stop a good assassin  from finding an opening and taking a shot  the best you can do is control where the best opening is  and sometimes thats enough  michael drop it  you set me up  bravo  put it down evelyn  hey i can still do this  did i tell you how much this job pays  you could buy someplace decent to live  even at miami prices  put the rifle down  how did you know id be here  i figured you had a source in the u s attorneys office  you knew doug was thinking about testifying  i count six different vantage points  with a better view of that entrance  how did you know id be at this one  istanbul wasnt that long ago  you like rooftops over windows  you like angles with the target on your righthand side  because youre lefthanded  thats right  i knew i liked you  put it on  michael is this what you really want huh  helping out civilians with their little problems  trying to get your government job back  pathetic  youre better than that  lets go we have a big day ahead of us  ive got to turn you in there will be questions  it will be past lunch before were done  turn me in  a lot of secrets a lot of enemies   i think it would be a short stay dont you  now dont you think we could come to an arrangement  i dont think so  now be honest with me  if circumstances were different    do you think that we could   not in this lifetime  maybe the next one then  the indictments came down yesterday  that was quick  they found a leak in the u s attorneys office  and evelyn wow   theyre gonna be working up her file for years  she was a very very bad girl  i managed to keep you out of it so far  its gonna take some work  i appreciate that lucy  dont say i never did anything for you  i never would  did she say anything before   she wished  that things had turned out  differently  tell me about doug and jasper  on their way to a new life in an undisclosed location  hes gonna have to come back for trial  he wanted you to have that  and i have another present for you  its your new identity  it should get you to d c or wherever  thank you lucy  its the least i could do  and your car  whatever it costs to repair i want to reimburse you  dont worry about it  im not gonna be in miami that much longer  will i see you again  maybe  lucy  sam  so is that your new i d  yep  i could get into the white house press room  with these documents  i dont think youre gonna need it  why is that  i just got a call from a buddy  one of the guys i asked  to keep an eye out  on this burnnotice business  told me you might want to rethink your trip to d c  why what did he say  the guy who burned you  it turns out you dont need to go up there to see him  because   well hes coming down here to see you  see me  what does that mean  i dont know  just a headsup  well it looks like im gonna have to get
