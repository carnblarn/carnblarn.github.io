wall street silicon valley dc  any place where a little information goes a long way ive been there to protect it  any piexperience  a pi license comes with a lot of privacy concerns  theres a chance anythinga private investigator finds could wind up in court  yeah well i preferto resolve this quickly and quietly as possible  quick and quiet  thats what i do tell me about your problem  a few weeks ago i noticed unusual activityon the computers   files movedlogins at odd times  and then i started hearinga buzzing sound in my office phone  i checked it out  infinity transmitterin its base  i saw a lot of thatin the dotcoms  whoever installed itdidnt isolate the circuit  you were hearinga little feedback  i want to knowwho planted this  any ideawhat theyre looking for  i sell about 30 million worthof art a year  they could be thievesbuyers looking to lowball a bid other art dealers too many possibilities  my businessmy reputation depends on informationremaining private  lets take a look around  now the gallerys under  you cant get through herewithout someone seeing you  what aboutthe executive offices  well theres no cameras but all the officesare keypadaccess only  no one gets in here without me knowing  well somebody has  does anybody have a habitof working late  no later than i do im the first one inlast one out  so what do you thinkmr parker  think you can findwhoevers doing this  ill see what i can do i need a floor planof the office  ill have somethingby the end of today excuse me   alpha its bravo over  hello seymour  chalk one up for the brotherhoodof badass buddy  i got good news you got to get over here  so i asked aroundabout that explosives guy you were looking for  he does demo for the city but he moonlightsfor the russian mob  this is their hangout  hes their goto guywhen somethings got to go boom  any idea where hes hiding  no  seymouryou said you had good news  no i do hes got a girlfriend and theyre hot and heavy  i mean they cant be apartfor more than a couple of days without some together time    you know what im saying  i know what youre saying  i bet you do you and fi my goda moltenhot action couple  i cant even imagine what itmust be like in the bedroom   just dont do that  right am i right  were not together  are you serious oh my god you guys were like the   bombers girlfriend stay focused  there she is  dont point  bianca she

tracking deviceunder her car in front of the russian mob  oh but its cool i told him just pretendlike hes tying his shoe   hes gonna tip her offthat someones watching  keep your eyes on biancaand no more moves on your own  to protect someone without blowing your cover you have to come up with a story  one that explains what theyre doing explains what youre doing  and gets everyone out in one piece  hey you forgot your keys  wait my keys no what  you forgot your keyson my wifes dresser yeah  yeah that remind you  of course not everyone is a born storyteller  go with it run  but seymour saidto plant a tracker  and dont letme catch you near my wife again  i got to tell you this corporateespionage stuffis kind of fun  you know theres no gunsno explosions  its like going on the kiddierides at the carnival  so uhany idea how our spy got his wayinto the art dealers office  i know how id do it   cleaning crewcomes around midnight from the serviceentrance here  away from the gallerycameras  oh well thats good because then theresno door codes either cause the cleaning crewopens them for you  get in find a hiding placelet everyone clear out  and you get the placeto yourself  as stimulating as all this is i still dont see why you calledme over here michael  it always helpsto bounce ideas fi  uh im gonna grabanother beer  and uh drink iton the balcony  is thisabout the other night  is this about me not stayingfor breakfast  is it so strange that i wouldwant your opinion on a job  look me in the eye and tell methats all this is  i have to go see chandler  you think he came inwith the cleaning crew  i cant believei was so stupid  whoever did this didnt comethrough the gallery  theres a chance the parkinglotcameras got him at the service entrance  ill callthe property manager set up a time for youto stop by their office  you really think sweepingmy office is necessary  i dont think a phone bug was the only thingyour spy left you  well ive got dinnerwith a client you let me knowif you find something  a bug in its simplest form is just a microphone attached to a radio  effective but easy to detect with a frequency scanner  a more subtle device is the wireless keylogger circuit  nearly undetectable and easy to install  it transmits every password you type into the keyboard  all surveillance devices though share a weakness  theyre machines  when machines break somebody has to fix them  more spies get caught changing batteries and fixing wires than any other single activity  mr chandler yeah im gonna need to worklate tonight  mr parker  youre the receptionisthere right what is it   uh melanie  melanie right   we need to have a conversation  okay  i know this looks crazybut um i can explain  melanie  melanie  melanie stop stop  whatever youre up to its not worth stabbing mewith a letter opener  dont tell chandler hell kill me  chandler  yeah that sounds a littlehardcore for an art dealer  no you dont understand  he killed my father  my father was jdblake  the painter how bout that  well veronica was reallyinto pop art  you know you could standgetting out to a few museums every so often mike  chandlerwas his art dealer  trouble started over a paintingcalled lady in white  bids of like 5 million7 million were coming in before he even finished it  my dads healthwas failing but chandler just keptpressuring him to finish it  dad got sick of it said that he was gonna geta new dealer  ooh that probably stungchandler pretty good  the commission on 7 million thats a lot of money  one month later someone brokeinto my dads loft  beat him to deathand burned down his studio  lady in whitewas reported destroyed  the cops called ita burglary gone bad  you think chandlerwas behind it  and he neverput it together that youre jdblakesdaughter  i grew up with my momin new york  i didnt even know who my dadwas until about a year ago  we talked on the phonefor a couple of months  i never got to meet himin person  when i heardthat lady in white was being movedon the black market  i came down and got a jobwith chandler  i like your heart melanie but you know that paintingcould be anywhere  you get caught looking for ityoure dead  i got to provethat chandlers involved  his securitys good  i thought that i would get himwith that keylogger thing but i need more accessto his files  melanie im supposed to checkthe security footage from the service entrancetomorrow  the same one you used  you told himlook if he sees me   ill make sure he doesntprovided your story checks out  my story  uh dont worry about it well check into it  yo mike mikey  looks like melaniewas telling the truth  had to pull a few favors but i was able to get my handson that   an apartment leasefrom 1985  yep  check that out jdblakes signatureright next to melanies moms  little loft in soho the math adds up mike shes his daughter  all right give her a calltell her ill help her out  but tell melanieshe has to stop spying  ill handle it  to make a magnet powerful enough to wipe a security camera tape  you need a strong power supply  a wall outlet will do nicely if theres one available  but if you need something more portable a car battery works in a pinch  of course you have to be careful to use a heavygauge wire  if you dont want a fiery explosion that covers you in battery acid  but do it right and youve got a magnet powerful enough  to wipe any magnetic media you can manage to get close to  mr chandler saidyou were coming by he had a breakin  something like that  we keep all the footagebacked up on the hard drive there  should go backabout six months  if you can lay off justthe last few weeks to dvd i can go through them  sure or i can do vhs not that anybodyhas those anymore  thats uh not coming up  what whats wrong how do you mean  its not possible the drives theyre wiped the footage its all gone  i better tell chandlerabout this right now  you got a serious problem much more seriousthan you led me to believe   now i need to know   slow downjust   youre sayingthe footage was erased  i mean could it be a screwupin the machine  i know what it looks likewhen a machine screws up  and i knowwhat it looks like when someone is erasingtheir tracks  i mean how could anyonepossibly do that  a crooked security guarda hacker  hell for all i know it could have been some guywalking in with uhan electromagnet  the point ishes a professional  youre the security expert what do i do about it  well i got to startwith your computers i got to gothrough everything  i got to see if your systemshave been breached  my computer files no no thats private information  do you want meto find this guy with one hand tiedbehind my back  i mean are you hoping he walksthrough that door stands in front of youand says  hi im your spy  call mewhen youre serious  when youre playing the role of spy hunter and the person youre hunting is yourself  the trail of evidence can lead anywhere you say it does  wait  you really think access to the computers willhelp you find him  and no one can create more fear more paranoia than the spy hunter  i hope so but im gonna behonest with you  when youre dealingwith someone this good it could get a lot worsebefore it gets better  so i gave chandlersencrypted files a deeptissue massage  we got his whole life here  anything aboutthe lady in white  if he has ithe hasnt moved it yet cause theres no bigcash movements  and he hasnt been doing muchoffshore  well theres got to be something sam  oh theres somethingall right  the week melanies dad died chandlers calendar had a bunchof blank spots  so i crossreferenced thatwith the phone records came up with a guy   jacob orr a socalledsecurity consultant  he did a stintfor manslaughter   chandlers wetwork guy  if im a betting man  you want to makea new friend you can take fi  oh boy you sure knowhow to sweeten the pot mike  hey uh speaking of fi what was that whole businessat the loft you knowwith the weird energy  oh no mike tell me you didnt  you did didnt you you did  what no i dont knowwhat youre talking about what  how many times do you haveto touch the flame until you figure outthat it burns  you gonna help with the jobor not  of coursebut i object to the fact that you wanted me to workwith her without telling me   that you weredoing a little booty call  check  thats our boy  bigger in person  recently divorced  lives here at the hotel  spends a good chunkof his time bouncing in and outof rehab  looks like hes readyfor another visit  you sure youre upfor this  planting a bugin a cellphone  you think i cant get a guyto go up to his room  no id sayyou have a gift for getting mento make bad choices   michael told you  he didnt have to  well dont look at me he started it  fi mr orr is waiting  for a female operative picking a guy up at a bar is harder than it might seem  most men have a sense for when a pickup is going too well  if its too easy they get suspicious  if its too hard they move on  are you serious  my ex was from morristown  your ex that means your single now  now thats a leadingquestion  hows about i buy youanother drink  i really shouldnt  oh you should  or uh i could make you a drinkin my room  once an operative has a guy on the hook she needs backup to make sure things dont go too far  the proper sedative for cocktail hour ensures an early evening  chloral hydrate is a mild but effective choice   itll do the trick  after  so long as the targets interested in drinking it  what do you thinkyoure doing  if hes not you have to induce unconsciousness some other way  not with this shirt on  i want to seethese big muscles  you got somebody outside you set me up bitch  come on  what  wheres michael  make yourselfright at home  where is he  hes out getting some yogurt why whats going on  that security footage he erasedwith the magnet chandler paid to have the drivessent out to be rebuilt  okay relax thatll take a while  reconstructing datastripped off a hard drive is kind of like  puttinga shredded document back together againonly different  were runningout of time okay by the time hes doneim dead  were getting closemelanie  chandler hired a guyto do his dirty work  we put a bug in his phone this is what we heard  im telling you chandler the bitch attacked me she had backup  it was probablyjust a robbery  a twoman team to steal 40 im serious  if somebody found outabout the holding company   look ive got all that stufflocked up in my office just relax  ill relaxwhen i got my money  so sounds like they set upa holding company to deal with the dirty moneyonce they sell the painting  so if we can linkthese documents up connecting the two of them thats enoughto take to the cops  how are we gonna getthem though  i mean chandler  he doesnt even letthe cleaning crew in anymore  well i think its time for chandlers spyto be more aggressive  i mean mike not you  miles  what the helldid you get me into  what are you talking about  what they broke into my home  where i sleepwhere i live  what you sure it wasnt   no nomaybe the lock on the doorbroke itself  maybe my filesthrew themselves around  of course im sure  was there anything takendid he find anything   no all the files are encrypted theyre kept offsite  i talked to some peoplein the neighborhood  they said they saw a manand a woman it was a twoperson team  what what is it  a business associateof mine he was he was approached the same way   i thought that he was   and you didnt tell me  maybe im not being clear  i need to know everythingthat is going on  because now im involved  whoever this guy ishes got resources training   what kind of person could be   it could be anybody  some spy gets blacklistedgoes freelance  he could be standingright in front of you and you wouldnteven know it  jesus  i need to knowwhat hes after  chandleryou have a mistress fudge your tax records  steal a pack of gumin the sixth grade you have to tell me  its the only wayi can protect you protect us  no no theres nothingi dont have   nothing  okay  uh im gonna needto upgrade your system im gonna lock downyour office  i need accessto the camera feeds the security codesand the alarms  youre gonna haveto trust me chandler  you with me  yeah  okay mikeythe feeds are up  you sure you have to gothrough the gallery  chandlers checkingthe serviceentrance cameras i dont have muchof a choice  im at the west entranceof the gallery tell me when to go  okay you are clear to getto the first column  now  okay nowtheres a camera on the other sideof that column  and its sweepingthe north end of the gallery  so on my cue i want you to goto the left  uh left uh you sure  yeah mike whos the guylooking at the camera here yeah im sure  youre fine the cameras are moving moving  here we go 3 2 1  no no thats my left my left your right stop stop sorry  okay lets try this again  i want you to goto your left   when it comes to security the difference between a spy and a regular thief  is that a thief gets to take what he wants and run  a spy has to go back to the scene of the crime the next day and act like nothing happened  it makes the approach a little more delicate  hows it goingin there mike  yeah theres nothing here but certificates of authenticityfor paintings and artwork  its got to be heresomewhere  when youre a spy you spend a lot of time looking for peoples hiding places  its always good to start by searching where your target has the easiest access  of course smart targets dont always hide things where they have the easiest access  after that the search gets a little more subtle  you look for signs of moved furniture marks on the carpet scuffs on the walls  anything out of place  i found where hes hidingthe papers but its an armoredfile cabinet  well thats no sweat well just come back with a cutting torchand call it a day  yeah a torch would burnthe documents  i need somethingmore specialized like a diamondtipped drill bitwith a cooling system  that sounds likea doozy mike  looki can make some calls but its gonna takea couple days  lets get on it  melaniewere making progress  we should have everythingwe need in a couple of days you just needto sit tight  sit tight  chandler is acting weird  hes walkingaround the office staring at allthe employees checking peoples desks  that means hes gettingparanoid  thats good  the worse it gets the morehe turns to michael for help  what if he knows  theres no way he rebuiltthe security footage from those hard drives yet  the most important thingis for you to just actcompletely normal  pretend that nothingsgoing on  ill try i got to run its nice meeting you fiona  you too  you knowpretending nothings going on is easier for some peoplethan others  what have you gotseymour  ill show you what i got  tell fiona to fire upthe saab dude were gonna need roomfor three  your bomber is holed up in that little cottageright there  his girlfriend went overthis morning for a little  together time  booby trap on the door  i guess hes not expectingany more visitors  thats no problem  i got the shotguns and thosebreaching rounds i brought  theyll cut through that walllike its cardboard  that would make a little biggerbang than we want  the door isnt the only thingrigged to blow look  im gonna do some scouting figure out a bter routefor an approach  fi  man that guy  i mean its like he seesaround corners you know  so whats upwith you two  youre not togetheranymore  were inuh different spaces seymour  different spaces give me a break  as a practitionerof tai chi let me tell you somethingmissy  go with the flowof the universe all right  its destiny you two  forces bigger than us  dont argue with destiny it will kick your ass  believe me  ill keep that in mindseymour  i can drink this outsideif you two need some alone time  drink it here sam  so seymourfind your bomber  yeah the place hes staying atis wired to blow if we so muchas knock on the window  yikes well in other news i got a leadon a precision drill we can use on chandlersfile cabinet  buddys gonna give usa break  yeah melaniewhats going on  im at the office i found something  youre at the officeyoure not supposed to   i was talking to a girlfriendfrom work  she told methat chandlers secretary was shredding like a tonof paperwork  but get this the secretary didnt finish  she left a ton of paperworkfor monday so ive been going throughthe files and   youre at the officeon a weekend  if you used your employeesecurity code chandler will knowyoure

 he knows youre there you need to get outright now  oh my god oh my godhes here  melanielisten to me very carefully are you in the copy room  yeah i am  get a box of papersome duct tape and an extension cord  some duct tapeand an extension cord  tape the cellphoneto the top of the box and run a wire behind it and put itin the gallery entrance  do it now im on my way fi you got explosives  ill pretendyou didnt ask that  i have to take a more directapproach with chandler  i like the sound of that  mike you want meto come with you  uh no i want you to get in touch withchandlers hit man   yeah  its miles parker where are you   im at the gallery  are you all right did they come after you  what are you talking about listen its over  i shredded some filesat the office today  figured whoevers behind thismight go after them i was right  someone came in today usingan employee security code  whats so funny  you dont get it they tried to kill me  you think the spywhos doing all of this would be stupid enoughto come by your office  and use a security codeon the weekend  its a trap chandler  trap what  if you want to take anotherbreath on this earth do not go inside  ill be right there  there was a bomb wiredto my front door  it was just dumb luck i saw it through my livingroom window   youre serious  do i look like im joking  there it is right there the top of the boxis a detonator its wired to the doors  if you had gone inside theyd be picking uplittle pieces of you from the gallery floor  lookthis is your last chanceyou tell me what this guyis after  or i walk awayand you handle this alone  its about a paintingall right  im  im pretty sureits about a painting  what painting  its calledthe lady in white ive been trying to move iton the black market  its worth 7 million i think thats what he wants  genius what do you think is cheaperfor him   paying 7 millionor having us killed  so what are we supposedto do  we need to trade the paintingfor our lives where is it  lets just get out of hereand we can figure this out  when youre playing the spy hunter the goal is to get the target to trust you completely  to think of you as his only ally  convince him that hes on the brink of disaster  wheres that paintingchandler  its at my house its at my house  and hell tell you whatever you want him to  careful now the last time i saw you you got your ass kickedby a girl smaller than her  you son of a bitch  now now no need for namecalling feel that  feel your thumbgo snap crackle pop  okay looky here  this is what i didntput in your scotch when you
