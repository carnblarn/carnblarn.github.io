people your opponent depends on   the ones his organization cant function without  lose your keys  i can give you a ride  dont look so scared  loaded itwith a beanbag roundso it wont doany permanent damage  but the temporary damage that hurts like hell  did i forget to mention that  my fault my fault  maybe we should exchangeinsurance information  or maybe you shouldput these on  and get into the trunkof my car    yeah you see look  theres an element of theater in any offensive campaign  its not just about bullets and bodies   killing people usually creates more problems than it solves  its about undermining your enemys will to fight  destroying the morale of his troops  sending the message that fighting back is useless because the battle is already lost  i brought you a little goingaway

businessmike  i meanhe put the word out to every kid in the neighborhoodto look for corey  that was the plan we made him look vulnerable  with tonybreathing down his neckhe has to look strong now  quit yapping lets go  the actual theft of a car isnt difficult  the hard part is selling it once you have it  between the licenseregistrationtax recordsand vin number  its surprisingly hard to turn a car into cash  the best approach is to start with clean paperwork on another car from out of state  then match the stolen car to the clean paperwork  that means new vin tags and a new registration  and in case someone decides to check close  some hydrochloric acid and a file will make the etched vin number on the car chassis impossible to read  wellthats it  somikeyou think i shoulddrive around south beach  you knowjust to make sureit still drives okay  knock yourself out ive got a meeting  okay say hi to carla for me  hellomichael  hellocarla  do we have to go all the wayto your officeor
