                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until    we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted     when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit nojob history   youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way   you rely on anyone whos still talking to you     a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fb i  you know spies bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  hey is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere   spies make great neighbors theyre polite  they keep the lawn trimmed and they never crank the music at night  they dont stand out because they dont wanna be found  so if youre hunting for a covert operative and all youve got to go on  are the names of a few dozen suspects  youre out ofluck unless you know where to look   thats billjohnsons house   yep that gets funnier every time  so mike this is what the 10th bill weve looked at i need a break man   you made me buy you a beer after bill number eight  yeah   so ill buy you another round if you do the honors   okay deal  oh oh come on  okay thats two rounds mike   the garbage someone leaves on the curb  can often tell you more than a facetoface conversation   not a lot of junk mail  well that fits  i had a hard time tracking this particular bill down  keeps himself out of the system pretty good  and he buys a lot of prunes   shredded documents in the trash  used to be a strong indicator that someone had a secret  but nowadays everybody and their mother shreds bills to prevent identity theft     okay the guy lives with his mother  i ruined my khakis for nothing  i think weve found carlas sniper   laundry bluing is a synthetic dye  that dry cleaners use by the thimble  and covert operatives go through by the bottle  it blots out secrets and works like a poor mans dye pack  staining anyone who digs through your trash  wow the guys pretty paranoid they must be using him for something big  figure out what i may get some leverage against carla  i need to know everything there is to know about this bill  im on it buddy         excuse me   hey back of the line pal   l    larry correct me if im wrong but youre dead  okay youre wrong just dont tell my exwife  hey arent you gonna invite me inside  yeah of course yeah just hold that for a sec  watch yourself cause the  mike you think i would hurt you that hurts me  you know i always pat down guys who just show up who used to be dead  fine fine if youre gonna frisk me frisk me  though that sweep of my inner right thigh was pretty halfassed   what the hell are you doing here  i missed working with you man   since i uh retired  stay there  ive been working freelance stuff i got more work than i can handle  i just got a gig here in miami i thought maybe you might be interested  you want me for a job  yes i wanna pay you a lot of money to kill a lady  uhhuh still a yogurt man i see  well i guess some things havent changed  some things have  yeah i heard you got burned  thats all larry you just heard you sure about that  what you think maybe i had something to do with it  whoa i know youre angry mike  but you gotta know who your friends are  it wasnt old lar who used you up and spit you out it was the government   its a little more complicated than that  oh please come on  you went off the reservation kid  unauthorized kills selling secrets  i read the michael westen dossier thats floating around out there  you know what i thought finally  finally he wakes up finally the kid gets it  they put us out there they tell us the endjustifies the means  and sooner or later you believe them  im a weapon baby i dont need some government aiming me  i put people down i put some cash in my pocket so what  hey im behind you on this michael believe that  murder for hire civilians  dont pretend youre some kind of boy scout michael i know better  i dont know about this thing its a slippery slope  slippery slopes can be kind of fun like waterslides  just hear me out okay  jeannie anderson she is our deadee  thats my term its trademarked   she looks dangerous  hey some people live some people die kid  jeannie is a cancer nurse she married one ofher rich patients  he got better then he got sick again  now hes in a coma but she is gonna die first  so who doesnt want her to have his money  i cant tell you that all my deals are anonymous everything is email   theres no mess that way  yeah except for the killing  what you need my help larry is that it  michael i dont need help killing someone  if i wanted this lady dead she would be dead  now the whole idea here is that you will do this one solo  that way you can reestablish some kind of trust with me  and if everything works out well  maybe we can work together again  make some money  come on its not like you couldnt use a little cash  to buy some of the luxuries in life like hey furniture  more protein  this one pays 20 grand   work long enough in covert ops  and youre bound to be offered some pretty nasty assignments  when a badjob comes along you have two choices  and neither is very appealing  you can pass and watch the op go down  or you can take thejob and make sure the op gets blown   make it 30    deal  go get em killer  oh and michael i just wanna tell you what i tell all my clients  keep your nose clean if a cop comes within a mile of this i kill everybody  and you know me  i mean everybody      hi  michael i want you to meet  my brilliant adorable paramedic boyfriend campbell  hey its great to meet you man  fiona tells me youre a soil scientist  yes yes i love my dirt  im sorry i called so early if this is a bad time  you didnt wake us we were already up  campbell would you mind excusing us just for a minute  i have to talk with fiona about something its personal a family thing  oh yeah yeah no problem ill go order some breakfast  i dont know about you but i am starving   mmm  i know you gotta be starving too   you want some eggs hon over easy  mmm mmm   dont you just love him  ive been hired to kill a woman   youre changing the subject  yes but im serious i dont know who wants her dead  i have to find out and i need your help  fine you owe me  how do you know this guy who hired you  we worked together in the balkans in 91 92  it was a crazy time he seemed somewhat sane in comparison  and now he kills for a living  yeah he made some poor choices before his death  fifteen people watched larry walk into an oil refinery right before it blew up  apparently it was his way of taking early retirement  okay thats jeannie larry said she splits her time  between the hospital and the museum  theyre having a charity event here  doesnt exactly sound like the kind of woman anyone should want dead   whos bankrolling this  well thats what we need to find out  then we blackmail them make them pay larry to walk away then jeannie lives  i need to speak with jeannie alone preferably someplace quiet   well i can put you in the same room as her  but im not telling her shes been marked for death thats your job  fair enough but then you keep watch on her afterwards   are you trying to keep me away from campbell  who  what youre doing with this event its extraordinary  oh i dont know this charity stuff s new to me  i spend so much time at the hospital you need an outlet you know  would you give me your email i really wanna get involved  oh absolutely we could   oh my god i am so sorry  oh  uh no dont worry about it um excuse me just one second  jeannie   oh my  no no listen to me im not gonna hurt you  im not going to hurt you okay  im a friend im a friend all right  i cant have somebody coming in here because youre screaming  so i need you to keep quiet and listen to me do you understand  im gonna take my hand off your mouth okay dont scream okay   who are you  im michael  im here because someone was hired to kill you   who   me    okay okay but im not going to all right  im on your side i dont do that you understand     im gonna take my hand off your mouth again   who hired you  i dont know they stayed anonymous  i thought you might have some idea  usually with a job like this theres not a lot of suspects     what  who wants you dead  god i dont know   drew  whos drew  hes my husbands son from his first marriage  oh i cant believe this   he uh he was very very angry when i got written into the will  he thinks im some kind of gold digger   where is drew now  he might be at the house  he moved in when robert got sick  what if i just give him the money i dont care  you cant tell drew that you know he might kill you himself  but what happens when i go to the cops i have to go to the cops  no you cant go to the cops either  the people who are involved in this if they find out well all be dead   trust me  what do you expect me to do  nothing i will handle this for you okay  now you met fiona just now right  she is going to be an old friend from out of town  she will stay with you for a couple of days  shell keep an eye on you and on drew  you have to trust me its gonna be all right      michael  ive got some leftovers i thought maybe hi honey   oh my god michael what happened to you  im fine im fine   no youre not fine  im fine i just fell down at work thats all  this see  this is the thing i cannot deal with all right  thisthisthis wall that you put up do you have any idea how hard it is  to have an honest exchange with you when youre withholding like this  youre reading a book or something  im seeing a counselor michael and hes pretty sure youre the one who has the problems  so youre actually here twisting my arm until i go to counseling thats honest  besides weve tried counseling you quit remember  well i wanna try again  this new guy says the best place to facilitate a dialogue is in the home  i made an appointment for tomorrow  if youre not gonna do this for me michael then i dont know what to say  fine i will be there  great then   yeah i know im late but i come bearing gifts  thats the military jacket on our favorite billjohnson  buddy of mine pulled it in exchange for some sam time   not all my buddies are guys  your methods your business sam  so it looks like our buddy bill had a hell of a career in the marines  big deal sniper awful busy during gulf i and the fact that  carla put a dragunov in this guys hands  probably wasnt a birthday present  looks like he was dishonorably discharged  yeah right the guy was a model marine he was in for 20 years  i followed him for a little bit  sublets a room from the lady with the yappy dog so thats his landlady not his mom   we gotta get a bug in there  wanna go over there now and take a crack at it   tomorrow right now i gotta do a job with larry  larry  dead larry oh man i hated that guy  hes back  okay i hate him present tense  hes a bad influence dont tell me youre working with him  im not working with him im working against him  in that case can i help    you have a lovely home  thats the problem isnt it  i mean all this whatever i just wanted robert  he was the strongest patient i ever had thats what got me  and then i had to watch it come back  i just wanna be there for him to the end  you will   how much longer before drew gets back  um  twenty minutes  he runs a restaurant that robert bought him but hes not much of a worker  so he usually comes home early showers and then goes out with friends  give me a headsup if you hear him  this is disgusting  oh come on fi its one garbage can   youre gettin off easy trust me  heres something interesting  drew made a copy ofjeannies date book  at least now we know how larry got his information    drewjust pulled up  thats my cue gentlemen  michael keep this line open  you owe me a new cell phone im stashing this one   drew is that you  yeah whose saab is that out front  i have a girlfriend in from out of town  shes just uh sleeping up in the guest room  hustle fi if he catches you and it gets back to larry  the body count on this will go way up    hey hey roth man its drew no no no im straight  that last eight ball did me just fine i got a problem here  yeah about that other thing i need you to make a few calls the hit cant go down here  yeah shes got some bitch staying with her  if those guys are planning on getting her here youll just have to find another way   thanks  mike i dont wanna hurt your feelings  but it sounds like youre not the only person drew hired to killjeannie    you hiding sam axe in here  you told him  wow been a while  been a while and you look great  you too larry very youthful  still drinking the blood of children  well im glad you called kid  got an email from our client   seems jeannie has a houseguest  yeah we got bigger problems than that larry  it seems drew has doublebooked the job   he put the word out through his coke dealer  no no no  damn it damn it  im not gonna get angry im not gonna get angry  just cool down all right i feel a cleansing rash of heart attacks coming on  larry theres no need to poison anybody  yes there is my name is in the mix  theres amateurs on this gonna be cops all over it  we need to start putting people in the ground drew dead  jeannie dead the houseguest dead the coke dealer   anyone he hired et cetera  thats a lot of bodies  oh come on  are you gonna stand there and youre gonna tell me that you dont have the same impulse  i know how you used to look at people when they betrayed us  when their stupidity disappointed us  come on i know that look   and you know how easy this would be  its not the smart play here  ill go to drew ill tell him to call off the job  you know how convincing i can be  the cops will never hear your name ifjeannie lives larry  well i guess the baby bird has gotta leave the nest sometime  your call kid  but ifbeing a softy turns around to bite you in the ass  i will be here to say  told you so    thats our larry   covert operatives try to avoid assuming  other peoples identities whenever possible  theres just too many pitfalls when youre dealing  with someone your new identity has corresponded with  what have they said what have they been told what have they agreed to  of course it helps if the person youre deceiving  is terrified of the person youre pretending to be   sorry to interrupt fellas but i need to borrow this guy  who the hell are you  im drews friend we met on the internet facebook buddies  uh yeah guys just uh just give us a few minutes  sure  so uh so youre   larry sizemore  i thought we were never gonna meet  you made it very clear in your emails we were never gonna meet  i didnt want to kid believe that but you got sloppy  sloppy no no no i followed all of your instructions  no you didnt you are one stupid careless son of a bitch   li dont understand  no kidding  i thought we had a deal drew  i would do the job and you would keep your nose clean   i was lli did  no i dont think  you actually understand what keep your nose clean means  because if you did  you wouldnt have told your coke dealer to hire other people to do my job   oh  oh whats the rule drew no cops   well i didnt think that roth was gonna  whats that  you didnt think what what you dont think roth  would ever get arrested for selling cocaine  what then chucklehead  hes gonna flip  i know a rich boy he wants his stepmom dead thats conspiracy   and then were all in  what if we get rid of roth  no if im killing anybody im killing you  some people live and some people die  which are you gonna be drew  theres one way you live you call off this hit   how many other people did you hire  ll two  you are going to make two  im sorry but i have to let you go phone calls right now  i cant i dont have time i have to get ahold of roth look give me till 500  im coming back at 400 and when i come back i want good news or youre my next deadee  and thats why i like to say that trust is a bridge  and it needs a strong foundation  and you cant build a bridge out of pain and fear can you  can you michael  uh no because that would make it um structurally unsound   im detecting a lot of negativity in this room  you see what im dealing with here   thats not helpful either  not helpful  you both have to commit to this work you owe it to each other  and i would like to remind you of that  so theres something i want both of you to do for our next session  are you giving us homework  i prefer to call it lifework  in fact thats the title of the book im writing  i would like each of you to make a list  five things youre grateful to the other person for  i think thats a great idea  mom do you still have dads old gas company jacket  probably not i threw away most of his work stuff   what do you need it for  i just do  michael youre supposed to be honest with me what happened to the bridge  fine uh i need to get a shutin and her yappy dog out of her house  i was gonna tell her she had a gas leak  well what about this exterminator uniform  tell her youre spraying her yard with some toxic material  and her poor little puppy is gravely ill and has to go to the vet  yeah you just send the bill to that address there and well pay for the visit   i dont understand how this could have happened  yeah neither do i  it was a total accident but i had to own up  now this stuff is toxic this spill and from what i hear  pets the little pads on their feet it just sucks it up like a straw  and you dont want your little loved one to be paws up next to the water bowl so   ill go  yeah maybe you wanna also have yourself checked out  the vet will take very good care of both of you    youre a wizard mikey  i dont know where you come up with this stuff  look what our friend was hiding in the wall   i guess carla talks to her sniper the same way she talks to you  she needs to freshen it up a little bit   try thejumble for a change    hey lar not a good time what do you need  just checking in how are things  things are good you dont need to be checking in its under control  yeah yeah yeah just listen  i wanna repitch my idea and in case you dont remember  the outline is lets kill everyone  no need for that not necessary  im heading over to drews now  and hes handing out pink slips as we speak   its under control  i hope so kid   i really do    just checking in hes got a weird thing for you  thats cause he doesnt have any friends  thats because hes killed most of them mike   when a pro plans an ambush  they capitalize on the element of surprise  they attack aggressively so their opponent  has to react from a place of weakness  an amateur on the other hand is more likely to take a defensive posture  which means they are the one acting from a place of weakness    hey buddy what are you doing back there   im sorry im sorry man  what are you doing with a gun   you said you were gonna kill me if i didnt call off the hit  you didnt call off the hit  no i tried i tried to call off the hit but i got through to one guy  then i couldnt get through then the other guy but i know hes gonna be killing her   today  yeah l i think its happening now  now what do you mean right now  i called this one guy aboutjeannie  he said it was gonna take him two days to get it put together  he told me he was gonna get a dump truck and he was gonna hit her when shes coming home  youre gonna call her right now you will calljeannie and you warn her   i already tried it didnt go through  so  the guy put in a cell jammer in her car to block all of her calls  its too late man  okay your names not involved the cops arent involved either   i promise its just gonna look like an accident  no cops  who do you think investigates fatal car crashes  please please you cant  no i could  you dont know how easy youre making this for me drew  okay i could run just let me run please let me run  please please let me run  run   cell phonejammers emit radio waves  at the same frequency as commercial cell phones  theyre useful when you really wanna make sure someone stays out of touch   the caller you are trying to reach is unavailable   it doesnt matter if youre trying to take out  a moped or a dump truck  every vehicle has three areas of vulnerability  the driver the engine and the tires  a can of paint across the windshield could blind the driver  a 50millimeter cannon could kill the engine  but neither will guarantee the truck wont swerve into oncoming traffic  but if you force a vehicles front tires off the road  you drastically diminish its maneuverability  that way it cant swerve  of course getting a dump trucks tires off the ground  is even more difficult than it sounds and a hell of a lot more dangerous    come here you son of a bitch   i took care of it youre in the clear  drew is on the run and there arent any homicide detectives looking for a guy named larry  you know the last guy who cost me a bunch of money  didnt tell me about it with a smile on his face  lar youre looking at it all wrong  i didnt cost you a bunch of money i saved you a lot ofhassle  this way youre not gonna have to kill four or five people   four or five people whats that  well that is something  if you say so michael  and a dump truck wow i wish i had seen that  i mean i gotta tell you kid im a fan  well you were always very supportive thanks  well who knows maybe well get another chance to work together again someday   yeah maybe not  couldve been great  well i gotta go got another gig  gotta shuffle off to buffalo   see you around kid  ill see ya larry   listen to this mike your sniperjust made a call   saturday ill be there at 1500  when are you going to give me the name of the target  and this is it right no more games i get my pension back  well it sounds like another play from carlas  do what we say or well ruin your life playbook  at least shes consistent sounds like billjohnsons got a date     guess i do too  drew for your sake i hope youre calling me from someplace far  yeah yeah im really sorry man i tried i tried  i mean i did i tried to go away i swear  but this guy showed up he just showed up and told me that the job was on   i tried to tell him  drew slow down slow down  okay all right this guy he knew i wanted jeannie killed  i tried to tell him the job was off he said its still on   he told me i have to pay him otherwise  guy what guy  hes tall hes an older guy  he said his names michael westen  were adding four more but there could be a possibility of six or eight   okay  im not really   excuse me a moment  of course   but you said it was over  we had one slip through the cracks   who  its complicated   i have to admit this is pretty exhausting   i know  but at least we know whos coming this time  you still have that charity lunch today youre gonna go to it  fi will explain what you have to do  itll be a little out of your comfort zone but well keep you safe okay  okay  hey mike come on you wanna lock this  that sociopath is still out there  larry wont come after me he thinks were brothers in arms or something   i dont know man  he used your name i think you pissed him off  no that was just his way of saying  hands off my operation sit this one out  hey you were right about how larrys coming afterjeannie  drugstore across the street from his hotel had a little fire last night  enough to mask him swiping something nasty im sure   he always did like his poisons  yeah  any guesses on where or when hes gonna make his next move  drew was told to have his money ready by 100  the poison plus the time larrys going tojeannies lunch  after shes dead drew brings larry the money  and thats when youre gonna  look you want me to do it  no  it should be me   no teeth were left to identify  yeah yeah yeah  michael westens a real dangerous man  i dont need you to read me his file we go way back   so this is gonna work out  oh sure  just not for you because when you pay him youre dead   why why would he kill me  youve seen his face   then ill ill run  yeah you should run  but you should make damn sure michael westen is dead before you do that   how  by serving him up for me  youre paying him today right i just need to know where  he said he was gonna direct me to the handoff once the jobs done  he said just be in your car with the money in the gables ready to go  hes doing it walking distance from the hit oh that is nice  okay this is what were gonna do you will go where he says  you will give him your cash and then you will hit the deck when the bullets start flying  once michaels dead then you can run  and drew if you ever come back i will find you   i wont  good good  because youve seen my face and i dont like you   well aside from a few really hideous dresses  theres not much to be scared of in here yet  hes gotta be around there somewhere fi hes tall dyes his hair    face like a ferret  hey  where did the man in black come from   wait a minute youve got him  hes good  he came out of nowhere goodlooking too  yeah hes all right i guess hes no campbell though  who is hes the only boyfriend ive ever had who comes with his own ambulance    larryjust sprayed jeannies fork with something  wait a minute thats probably atropine you might wanna telljeannie   shes about

death  and a believable emergency response is almost impossible on a budget  one lone ambulance isnt going to sell it  get em inside get em inside quick  so unless you happen to have a fleet of fire and rescue vehicles  uniforms and a dozen actors you trust you really do have to call 911   you just have to have called your people first  hold on jeannie hold on  howd you guys get here so fast  were losing her  you were fantastic  how can you be so relaxed im serious never again   hey jeannie how you doing  well im alive  well thats good right   where to sam  anywhere you want buddy   hang on      im pulling in i dont see you  thats the point  but i see you now hang up  get out of the car leave the money in the trunk  and make him come to it   spend a career in covert ops  and youre going to know some bad people  youll work with them youll live with them you might even trust your life to them  but none of that makes them your friend it cant  because one day you might have to end

working and i just  jesus michael  vision are you serious  what you couldnt come up with five real things   li did i did  he doesnt even think i ever did five things for him  in his life i was a terrible mother  no wonder you ran away   you ran away  no i didnt i joined the military when i was 17  my dad signed a form he couldnt wait to get me out of the house  i signed the form i forged his name  he would never let you go into the military michael  why didnt you tell me  because i didnt wanna take away the one thing that you were grateful to your father for  i would have if id known my list was so short  you forged dads name why  because i knew if you didnt leave youd end up in jail  or worse  theres always been a part of you michael  maybe its from your father i dont know  you could have turned out different i let you go  because you needed to focus on something good  this is what ive been talking about youve crossed the bridge   oh get out of my house  get out of the house  mom  thank you  this has gotta be the place   wow he looks grumpier than you do when youre going to meet with carla   well she hasnt had me kill anyone yet  mmm   black bag missions are often broken into separate parts  operatives are given discreet tasks to ensure secrecy   sam the badge  theyre likejigsaw pieces  and you never know if any of the ones youre given are from the same puzzle  but if you can get your hands on a corner piece  the part where the puzzle starts to take shape  sometimes you realize all your pieces fit together  its the same one carla had me forge   damn mike the badge the rifle  carlas turned you into this snipers personal shopper  if everything ive done has been tactical support for one big op  i think i know how to find out what shes planning
