                1 my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until    man we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  previously on burn notice  blood looks like somebody was dumping a body  that would explain why he disappeared  the dead body belongs to jeremiah kassar  i hate to sound paranoid  but we had breakins around here recently  she kills kassar  then sits on the place next door  to see if anyone comes knocking  we just blew our chance to end this thing  i dont know jesse i think were just getting started  spies are used to battling  cuttingedge encryption and billiondollar security  but sometimes the toughest challenge  is cracking something old and out of date  if you find yourself up against an obsolete tape drive  loaded with arcane software  you can either find yourself a time machine  or admit defeat   and three hours of armtwisting to even access this drive  and its unreadable  i know its a little frustrating   frustrating oh its more than frustrating michael  were trying to track down the people  that let a psychopath stick explosives in a miami hotel  we have nothing  i wouldnt say its nothing  look   no no not in the trash  the owner of this killed our best lead  which makes her someone we should talk to  ah the elusive kendra  you think shes just gonna give you a call  invite you to brunch  spies always assume theyre being followed  it could mean nothing that a route is blocked  forcing everyone to leave the building through one exit  but when that exit is in view of a driver  whos been sitting in a parked car since you walked in  that starts to mean something  good news  i think kendra just found us  gray san right behind you  you think shes been sitting on this place  she probably figured wed have to  bring the tape drive here at some point  which we did  still think this is a dead end  it is if she kills us  aw thanks dear      hey mike hows operation boring tapedrive  just got more interesting kendras surveilling us  oh everybodys favorite murderer  makes a special appearance  you need help losing her  no we need help grabbing her  tossing her into a storage container getting some answers  how quick can you get over to the design district  about a half an hour maybe less  you want to run her through foot traffic  yeah lets get her walking you play lookout  theres an alley behind the dress stores  we can grab her there  okay game on see you in 30      that sound good to you  all i heard was dress stores  you know if im gonna spend the afternoon playing bait  i think you should buy me the nicest thing i see  being hunted isnt always a bad thing  when someones on your tail you can pick the route  and if youre really good  you can lead them into a trap of your own    yeah sam well theres no sign of kendra  unless shes disguised as a fat tourist  well keep your eyes open shes slick  well that could be our girl  okay mikey pick up the pace  yep  shes tailing you with reflections  the girls got some moves  wonder where she got her training  not sure but theres something about her that bugs me  okay your alleys coming up  i left a taser for you underneath a crate  ill bring up the rear  okay mikey all yours any second now  where is she        you dropped your phone  oh did i  seems like im always losing things  who are you  i could ask you the same question  its kendra right  thats as good a name as any  why are you after me  and here i was thinking it was the other way around  why dont you come back down  so we can have a nice little chat  a little chat with the guy who tried to grab me in an alley  a couple days ago you tried to kill me  touch  look im willing to forgive and forget  but sooner or later youll want to meet up  i have something that you want  mm someones cocky i like that  i hope youre ready to have some fun    so now kendra knows youre after her  she knew that before  and now we know that shes after us which is an opportunity  yeah its an opportunity for one of us to end up dead  shes probably tracking us with that phone  right because im an amateur  i forwarded the phone to this burner  kendras gonna want her tape drive back  im gonna offer to let her buy it back from me  so youre baiting a killer  you dont have to be counterintel to see the risk in that  its the best way to get her close to us  and when shes close i grab her  trust me ive done this before  mmhmm and how are you still alive    michael jesse said youd be dropping by  good timing you can meet a friend of mine  actually im a little busy  okay  ill tell her not to worry about the drug dealers  this womans in the middle of a serious situation mike  youre in on this  why do you think i asked you to come over here  i expect this from her  lauren was my favorite doctor  before she moved to homestead  her boyfriends kind of a community leader down there  david started the clinic last year  i volunteer down there  this towns been hit hard with the economy  my mom mentioned something about drug dealers  yeah a couple months ago  these drug dealers showed up in town  started selling heroin right outside our front door  can you believe that theyre slinging dope right by the clinic man  did you call the cops  david called them a few times  the police show up they arrest a drug dealer or two  but half an hour later  theres another dealer in the same spot  yeah it gets worse too  yesterday david was walking to his car  these guys attacked him they beat him up  they said they knew he called the cops  they told him to get out of town  but of course davids not going to do that  im scared theyre gonna kill him    im not even sure what im asking here but um  hell see what he can do hmm  hey lauren  hi  thank you for coming please come on back  im sorry its so hectic here  the other clinic closed two weeks ago  now its just us  david these are the people we were talking about  no please lauren im busy  hello to you too  im michael this is jesse this is fiona  i appreciate you stopping by  but laurens told me all about you  and working outside the law will only make matters worse  now theres only one move here  and thats to keep calling the cops  until the dealers go away  correct me if im wrong  but isnt that why they want you dead  yes it is  and trust me im not trying to be a hero here  but those thugs  are selling heroin all over the neighborhood  and someone has to stand up to them and if people around here  are too afraid to call the cops themselves   look david i know you think youre doing the right thing  but having the cops drag away a few streetlevel dealers  isnt gonna solve your problem  all youre doing is hurting  their bottom line by a couple percent  they tried to reason with you next time itll be worse  well i wont be intimidated  ive dealt with people like this before  ive set up clinics in brazilian favelas  villages in uganda   and usually miami is a little safer  but in this caseyoure gonna get yourself killed    i hope youre not paying them for this pep talk  david please listen to them  theyre here to solve our problem  so what  you justsnap your fingers and the dealers disappear  well its worked before  well figure out something  the point is well deal with them from the outside  so they dont retaliate against you or the clinic  all right fine   he seemed to really like us  hey the guys standing up for his community  its pretty inspiring  theres a fine line between inspiring and suicidal  fiona i saw we hit them hard send a message  guys we dont even know who were dealing with  lets figure out who these guys are working with  fine   just promise there will be  some hitting involved at some point  kendra nice to hear from you  first ring  i hope you didnt stay up all night waiting for my call  the anticipation was killing me  imagine how special itll be when we meet face to face  well id love to meet up  as long as youre bringing me a gift  i dont know about a gift  but the tape drive will cost you 50 grand  there you go  killing the mood  well ill make it up to you  brickell plaza tomorrow at 400  dont be late  someones getting a little too flirty for his own good  fi im trying to snatch kendra off the street  and tie her to a chair  you are not helping your cause  this is just a harmless game of cat and mouse  between me and a professional killer   i should scout brickell plaza  think you guys can climb the dopedealing food chain  yeah yeah well get sam out here  find another corner those dealers are working  figure out whos running the show  give me a ride home first  take the bus romeo  its a dangerous neighborhood  these guys are pros fi  see nobody ever touches  the drugs and the money at the same time  if we were cops  we would basically have about nothing on them  reason number 337 im glad im not a cop  sleazebag number one is doing his count  you think the runners on his way  lets hope  as much as i like watching a liquor store parking lot      we doing this or what people  im the impatient one around here  its looking like the moneys on its way  well it sounds like they need a new customer  if youve ever accidentally  set off an alarm at a clothing store  you know how radiofrequency tags work  spies use lightweight rfid trackers too  but instead of catching shoplifters  theyre able to tail their targets more effectively  whatcha want need five dimes  oh its 60 bucks   bounce radio waves off an rfid tracker  with a modified digital depth finder  and you can keep tabs on whatever you like  without having to get too close  then its just a matter of waiting for it to move    thats our runner  and this is where the money goes    well you dont have to be an expert in body language  to see that hes the one calling the shots  running his operation out of a strip club  classy  still i should probably follow him in there fi  this surveillance could take a while  well you know there is a quicker way  to get a handle on his operation  michaels old neighbor  sugar really  he owes us a favor  and he obviously knows the drug scene  i really dont like hanging out with that guy  well im calling him  youre the one who volunteered for inside surveillance    whatcha looking for sammy jackandjills tachas  no drugs sugar we just want your expertise  yokn any big dope dealers in homestead  nah its smalltime down this way  aint no real ballers south of 142nd  yeah there might be one now  oh no man  what kind of malfeasance you got me mixed up in here  that dudes psychotic he gives dealers a bad name  sounds like you know him  vince cutler everybody in the game knows him  he came down from the bronx  and now hes spreading through dade county like the plague  a couple years back in hialeah he shot my friend carl  hed have shot me too  but i swore id stay out of his business forever  and now im hanging in his strip joint  thanks sammy this is suicide  this is a public place sugar youre okay  you dont get it  hes been cozying up to some mexican cartels  they fronted him a huge stash now hes got to pay them back  aint nobody scarier than somebody trying to move up   wait wait wait a second  how do you know that about his stash  everybody knows man hes a heavy hitter  you need more reasons why we got to get the hell up out of here  wait sugar wait wait hang on wait a second    working in the field often demands making tough decisions  cutler yo grab him is that sugar  but if you have to choose  between letting someone get killed  or getting beat up as a distraction  oh yo   yo yourself hey you owe me a drink  move out of my way  ill move out of your way when you buy me another drink  oh hey i didnt ask for a lap dance  you should thank me for letting you walk out of here  okay thank you  you pick the bruised ribs   every time  right yeah hey point taken  nothing distracts someone like rage  although getting someone really angry  can be risky  man you should have left when you had the chance   aah  yeah you want some  thought id introduce myself to the head honcho  oh and howd that go  worst surveillance ever  this is insane  i cant let you turn this place into a fortress  sorry david  from now on  everyone comes and goes through the front door  so we can keep an eye on things  is that  no please do not bring a gun in here  i thought you were just gonna tell the dealers to go away  were not gonna get rid of them that easily  this guy cutler has to pay back his supplier  they need to run the corners 247  so theyll never leave  not without a good reason  but well give them a good reason  they took a huge amount of heroin from the cartel  they need to sell it to pay off the debt  so we need to find his supply take it  and hell be running from some very angry mexicans  so youre gonna steal his drugs  well that sounds even crazier than calling the police  david think of it this way  the police are kind of like this bandage here  they mostly just cover up the problem  were more like  this  so how do you plan to find where this guy hides his drugs  were gonna give him something else to hide  and what do you have that a drug dealer needs to hide  we need some fentanyl do you know any veterinarians  im not sure if my head is throbbing  from the cut or the prospect of spending more time with sugar  youll know soon   hes here  hey what up boys  im on the team bro  were going after cutlers stash  we need a little more help cutler  hey was i like not clear before  because i think i remember saying something  about staying away from that dude  before sammy here got wrecked  i wouldnt consider this wrecked  and stop calling me sammy  im just saying im with you guys i owe you  my word is bond except for this time  relax sugar  youre not getting anywhere near cutler again  thank you  now if theres anything else i can do for you guys   i just need you to make a few phone calls  call your buddies up north  and tell them to remember working with me  i got to vouch for you  how about instead i get you guys some fineass cuban cigars  you guys like cubans  okay ill make some calls  spies spend so much time  thinking through operations from every angle  that occasionally they get too clever for their own good  sometimes youre better off keeping things simple  if a drug dealer is looking to get rich  theres no better approach  than offering him a great deal on drugs  vince  vince cutler  kyle barkley  i heard youll be running this town soon  i figured i would speed up the clock  and get to say i knew you when  i got no idea who you think i am  im just here to watch the girls  not trying to make friends  i got enough friends im here to talk business  hold on  i could be sitting anywhere in the world right now  but im sitting here next to you do you know why  cause you and i we have a lot in common  were a perfect fit  just gonna hit you with one word   one word   fentanyl  you spikin your punch with it  this is neither the time nor the place   dont answer i already know youre not  youd have a nicer watch  hol hey hold on hold on  you want to live in the 90s be my guest  wait  if you want to deal your junk you want to chase some tail  you want to enjoy the small time  ill find somebody else to make rich  but if you want to make your stuff 10 times stronger  with my synthetic painkiller  you wont find a better product for a better price    all right  so what you uh you in wholesale  yeah i was shipping pharmaceuticalgrade fentanyl  to dc  dealer up there  his junks so strong  he could barely pocket all the cash  mm  fool got shot at a dogfight  now all of a sudden im a supplier without a demander  yeah well i can be demanding  okay then okay  show me your stuff i check its purity  i show you how to lace it  but i dont work with walkins from out of nowhere  well of course im a walkin  we havent  we dont know each other  let me get your digits lets swap  go    yeah you got a cute little song and dance  but just cause you shake your stuff in my face  dont mean im gonna pull out my wallet  ill tell you what   you do your thing you find out who i am  and you call me  hit me on the hip  when you want to move to the champagne room      sam cutler like your pitch  just enough to call sugars contacts in dc  itll give us a little time  to focus on this kendra business  speaking of  love the new look  ah thanks  its my assassinsnatching costume  so mike uh  you really think kendras coming here to make a deal  and bullets are cheap  she wont kill me  until she knows im holding her tape drive  and she wont get the chance  before sammy the mall cop picks her up for shoplifting  if she resists zap her  im betting shes gonna resist        kendra youre late  im watching you right now  i thought this was gonna be a facetoface  why dont you come down here the smoothies are great  no thanks i dont get within kissing distance  until i really trust someone  all right how about this  ill leave the tape drive here  you leave my money there  ill take the stairs you take the escalator  we both head home happy  no i dont like meetingplaces that you select and scout  who knows what little traps youve set  oh kendra just when we were getting to know each other  ill call you later to set up another meet  and next time i pick the place        yeah sam  sorry man she slipped away  shes playing hardtoget well grab her next time  theres gonna be a next time oh goody  hey some kids just stole some dvds from my store  yeah thats a shame good luck with that    mom what are you   i just talked to lauren  she said that yyou and fiona  are bringing guns into the clinic  it was that or shut it down for a while  and david wouldnt agree to have it shut down  the community needs that clinic michael  the whole point is to keep it open  no the whole point  is to make sure it doesnt turn into a morgue  fine maybe we should have just bought them two bus tickets  im not the one running them out of town  please do not smoke in here    lauren is my friend i wanted you to help them  and now theyre more scared aaand upset than ever  not to mention the fact that david pretty much hates you  i cant care about that right now  and it doesnt change anything  im fighting for him whether he likes it or not   now just tell lauren to tell him  im one of the good guys  mr cutler good to hear from you  had words with your friends up north  lets see if your products as good as they say it is  well the next time somebody complains about my drugs  will be the first  now where is your place  i got somewhere better to meet  theres a spot on the edge of town   take the redland exit  mass quantities of illegal drugs  can be hard to get your hands on  but its even harder to come by  drugs regulated by the government   manufactured distributed and sold under lock and key  even drug dealers recognize their value  its mr song and dance  oh please  my fathers mr song and dance kyle call me kyle  you got a racetrack hookup or something  something  what you got there is pure regulated  pharmaceuticalgrade  somebodys got to give the junkies what they love right  am i right  now theres a pretty spot that youve picked  we should probably get moving  ill show you how to cut this into your smack  nah my guys will figure that out  oh what are you gonna do you gonna reinvent the wheel  i hope you enjoy wasting five k of the product  playing amateur chemist  i guess my privacys worth five k  your stuff better pan out or uh  gun right lets do lunch talk soon  get that over to the stash house    i dont think theyve spotted me  sure not doing anything to lose me  beginning to think these drug dealers arent too bright  or they know something we dont  dont stress westen i got this  all right we must be getting close now  its turned into a residential neighborhood  west of seventh  give them some space jesse  trust me ive done this before    damn it i just got cut off  trapped the suv got away  dont worry about the suv get out of there now  cops use checkpoints to catch drunk drivers  drug dealers use them  to catch people who dont belong in their neighborhood  man yo you know this dude  man 2 no  who the hell are you  um im taking a shortcut to my girlfriends place  is that so  yeah is this seventh street or seventh avenue  get out of the car  now  hey man  look can i ask you something    what did you say  i said why do you want to lose your teeth  making a getaway is often  more about precise handling than raw horsepower  so in a hostile situation  rearwheel drive is a nice advantage    that said it doesnt hurt  to have over 300 horsepower at your fingertips  when did this happen  late last night  after david and i locked up they fired into the clinic  they tossed this in  david some people from the neighborhood  are starting to get scared off  i told them not to give up that ill organize a meeting   people in the neighborhood have the right idea  we need to board this place up close it down at least   no no ii dont think you get it  look  mr heyneker  he comes in for heart monitoring  mrs rodriguez  she needs her physical therapy every day  well figure something out  i thought you had a plan  you said you were gonna find cutlers drugs  were close  we found the neighborhood  where he keeps his drugs just not the house  and until we close up his business its not safe here  well all i can say is work faster  because im not closing this place  david  let go of me  you can thank me later  its just a few nights david  you know it might not seem like were helping you   you kidnapped me  were keeping you alive  now if anybody needs medical help   this isnt about just providing medical help  people count on that place  iits practically a community center  parents let their kids hang out in the waiting room after school  because they know its safe  well its not safe now youre putting people in danger  please  theres iced tea in the fridge    unless you want a permanent roommate  we better hurry up and find cutlers stash house  you really think thisll work huh  beats getting shot at  aerial recon is invaluable in modern warfare  if you need to scope out a place  thats too dangerous to visit on foot  using a homemade drone  is almost as good as rerouting a spy satellite  outfit a remotecontrolled plane with an infrared camera  and you can get a good look at your target from above  install an enginecutoff switch  and no one will even hear you coming    sam i think the cameras too heavy  uh or maybe youre just not a natural at everything mikey  let me show you how to do it  come on here we go wait  here we go wait  see you got to hold  wwait a second  there whoa where you going where you going  well youre worse than i am  well its a little windy  well what do you expect  ease off the throttle  you think you can do better kid  yeah  we should enlist that kid in the air force  age limits be damned  why are some of these picturesjust of the sky  oh he was showing off  he was doing some looptheloops  hes kind of a smug little brat  how about this one  check out this cluster of guys  im betting thats the stash house perfect  well pay them a visit bright and early first thing  sam you think you can get your hands on a delivery truck  well ive run down interpol files  fabricated fake ids hacked into phone records   yeah i think i can get my hands on a delivery truck    kendra ive missed you  kendra how sweet  you free tomorrow afternoon  sure  well the weathers been so nice lately  i was thinking we could do something outdoors  why do i get the feeling  that this is going to be a sticking point  bring my tape drive to the old dock  at the sunrise bay marina  and all kidding aside come alone unarmed  or ill be looking for a place to hide your corpse  delightful    we got one more shot at kendra  but you wont like her conditions  i dont like that there are conditions period  i wish our phone conversations were as flirty  she threatened to kill me i can do that  why dont we give david the good news instead  cant let you do it let me go now  do not go anywhere all right lis david listen to me  get your hands off me  michael i tried to call you do something  michael whats going on hes trying to slip out the back  we talked about this david  theyre going after the clinic  fiona cutler yes  whats happening  theres this patient  a local kid hes epileptic  he needed his neurontonin so lauren had to sneak in  now i told her to be careful  but one of the drug dealers saw her  where is she now oh shes safe  but one of my neighbors called me  cutler and his guys are telling people  that theyre hitting the clinic to send us a message  michael you should call the police lauren already did  but a patrol car driving by every 20 minutes  isnt gonna stop cutler  you dont let him out of your sight  were going to the clinic  no ill go with you  david no  let him take care of it all right    did you people not get the message  cause i told my boys to send you a message  it should have been relayed to you  youre closed down  the clinics closed  someones off his meds  this is my town you understand me  where are the cops  maybe theyre tired of answering davids calls  no one gets in my way  we have sniper rifles lets stop them  you snitch  youre gonna pay the consequences  if we intervene hell know somethings up  our best chance is   no one goes against me  never mind  lets clarify that point for these mother        what the hell wheres it coming from  lets just get out of here    i know you keep them from burning the place down  and i appreciate it i do  but you cant guard it around the clock  maybe we can just   david we dont need a new plan  in a couple of days youll be fixing up the clinic   why so cutler can hit it again  not if hes beaten within an inch of his life  cutler was asking for war  lets give it to him  no fis right  enough of this sneaking around crap  my only question is do we hit his club or his stash house  look we must stick to the plan  cutler tried to torch the clinic michael  id like for him to suffer a little  guys we need to be smart here  confronting cutler isnt   michael i need to talk to you  not now ma right now  excuse me   mom if you have a plan  for handling violent heroin dealers  i am all ears  do you remember  when you and nate were in middle school together  and there was tthat bully todd  who was always picking on nate  i really dont have time for this right now  well you went over to todds house  and you told him if he messed with your little brother  then he was messing with you  and it worked  todd left nate alone for the rest of the year  inspiring story listen mom   yeah until the next year  when you went off to high school  and then nate was fair game michael  todd and a bunch of those punks made his life miserable  i dont remember that  thats because he never told you michael  anyway thats not what solved the problem  okay  one day nate had had enough  and he whacked todd with a 2x4  of coursehe was suspended from school for a week  but after that everybody left him alone  and you know why cause he stood up for himself  mom david isnt up against middleschool bullies  these people will kill him  i dont think that youre gonna let that happen  either youre with us or youre not  but were hitting cutler back  no we are not  davids going to be the one who stands up to cutler  were just gonna give him a little help  okay all aboard  michael so this truck will get them past the checkpoint  yep you good yeah  another bag  what is this  every explosive you own  huh you dont know me very well  okay ill deliver our special guests  you putting cutler on high alert  yeah and assuming he requires a little demonstration  you mind paying the corner boys a visit  not at all  i thought you said i was standing up to cutler myself  trust me the spotlight will be on you  look david i am no fan  of sending an untrained man into danger  so you got to promise me  that youll follow the playbook here  ii wont use a gun  but otherwise ill do whatever it takes  good  now to really sell this  its gonna have to look like you beat me up  now youre probably gonna object  to punching me in the face so sam do y  one more time   yeah just not quite as hard  oh hold on hold on  i there you are i have been calling you and calling you  what the hell are you doing here i told you id contact you  he shot two of my guys  in cold blood like it was nothing  now he is coming after your stash  get the hell out of here  who are you talking about  this guy david  he runs a clinic around here  what  nah hes nothing hes nobody trust me  no no no no  i found out he was after me so i looked him up  turns out he runs with these mercs or something  what he used to run black ops with these dudes  all around the globe  no no youre wrong  he was on helping kids crap in south america in africa  he wasnt just helping kids  hes exdelta force man  what the hell  so why the hell is this guy running a clinic huh  i dont know  maybe he was taking a break from all of the killing  you know and you just had to piss him off didnt you  you know your corner boys  theyre probably already dead    what the hell are you talking about  hello  hello  yeah yeah yeah everythings copacetic  well im doubling back now man  but im telling you i was just there  and everything is copacetic    yo we just got hit  son of a bitch  what hello  hello  someone shot at us outside that clinic yesterday  did this guy this david guy  did he follow you here  huh did he follow you here  youre not listening to me  he is coming after you and your stash  after my stash  we got to get out of town  no you run im not running  round everybody up im gonna end this thing  come on lets go    all right get down there    get over there  im in position  got a great angle on the stash house  im covering our boy cutler he is in battle mode  okay now its all on david  look alive theres no room for error  so hows david with public speaking  you guys consider this public speaking  sending someone untrained into a combat situation  is like dropping your kid off on his first day of school  you give as much advice as you can  you watch from a distance  and you cross your fingers  that he comes back in one piece    what the hell do you think youre doing here  come on david  im here to tell you to leave town  all i wanted was to run my clinic  i just wanted to live in peace for once  stop hurting people  even if they deserve to get hurt  okay jesse smoke em out    you think youre running stuff now huh  i didnt want to do this  but you forced my hand    what was that  you ready fi   am i ready    you think youre gonna run me out of town with tear gas  no  man what the hell was that  just waste him  tell me where your guys are  and i promise ill kill you quickly  my guys theyre everywhere  now you have to decide   are you gonna leave town  or are you gonna stay and face the consequences  i got a consequence for you   aah  aah man where is he  now its your turn to think  cutler lets just go man  ill give you to three  one  two  three  bingo  ah ahh  you made up your mind  youre crazy you gonna kill us all  not if you leave  now  now    thats how we do it people  looks like everyones happy to have their clinic back  yeah  and they arent afraid anymore  i cant imagine more drug dealers moving in  well they wouldnt want to mess with this guy  cutler left town last night  im not sure if hes more scared of you  or the mexican cartel he has no way of paying back  i know we didnt always see eye to eye but you saved us  we helped out a little  take care of these people all right  ill do my best  bye  thank you  see  sometimes people need to fight their own battles  mom i got it the first time  still its better to have michael westen than a 2x4    sam oh great  tons of hiding places completely abandoned  this place is a tactical nightmare  you got to get kendra on the phone  give her a rain check  if i want to get close enough to grab her  i got to meet her on her terms  might as well be today  just listen to what youre saying for a second  this lady makes corpses  she didnt tell you to come unarmed and alone  because shes shy  ill be okay i brought this    i reinforced it with a half an inch of metal siding  its not a gun but  its certainly not a gun  just sit back here and cover me as best you can  from this far away  you better not leave my sight bucko  do you have butterflies i have butterflies  id rather have my 50000  soon enough  care to show me whats in your briefcase  a girls got to be safe  aw damn it mikey
