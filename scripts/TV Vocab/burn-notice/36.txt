the big guy  cause you know mike  i got a way with the ladies  yes you do  oh  oh that marmaduke  he will never learn  do you like marmaduke  oh i see the silent treatment  you know its a great antiinterrogation method  as long as you an keep it up for a couple of weeks  what do you people want  she speaks  well for starter you can tell me your name  where youre hiding the ledger  and well just go from there  natalie  im a property manager  and i dont know anything about your ledger okay  okay tell me about your friend  hes a monster  and youre just an innocent doe in the woods is that

a day or a month  so now that were on the same page  anything you want to add  youre totally gonna kill me arent you  work in the field long enough  you recognize hard target for interrogation  people

for all of this to just go away  are you one of barrys client  well lets just say i work for a man  a very private man who has kept some money offbook  barry has been taken care of  regrettable but necessary  you understand mister  washington george washington  uh mr washington uh your friend is going to um  crack  and when she does you will cease to be useful  now i dont want to see that happen  i still think we can have a friendship  ive known this woman for three days  she doesnt even know my name  ask her what you want  youd be surprised what i can do with a little information  i want to make you an offer of friendship  you tell me where the ledger is and you go free  you dont  well  its just a matter of time  if i tell you your boss will have me killed like barry  but i have an insurance policy  if i dont show up for the sale a friend posts it on internet  a private man like your boss  he wont like that  i have one to yours  oh yeah just super  he know were in the dark  hes not gonna crack unless we get more intel  what did you get out of her  well i was reeling her in  and then bam niagara falls  shes got more to give  but shes scared mike real scared  nice place  oh

just taking a few pictures  its not like im doing wetwork or something  its not like anyone ever got blackmailed or killed  from just a few picture right  have you thought about  who stricklers getting you into bed with  just leave me alone  all right im pulling the rip cord here  we need a whole new approach mike  what would you think about using a softer approach  you two are desperate  often fails as an interrogation technique  most interrogation subjects are already scared  scaring them more doesnt help  what they need is a friend  i thought you might want some tea  im kim  hes cute  his name is jared  look i know you want to get back to jared  we want you to get back to him  but youre gonna have to talk to us  i i dont know anything  im in real estate for gods sake  a lot of people are in real estate  they dont usually end up in your situation  i know what its like to make some mistakes  howd you get yourself into this  im a single mom and times are tough okay  so sometime i take a little extra cash from people  and let them use places offthebooks  you know like foreign guys  who want a condo for their girlfriend  three days ago he shows up  he says that he heard of me  that hell hurt my on if i dont do what he wanted  he took my money and my passport  and then he made me drive him around  used me as his own personal realestate agent and  for other things  son of a bitch  im sorry that it happened to you  but isnt that all the more reason for you to help us  we can take him down together  i have to get to my sisters  cause thats where i left my son with her  honey the people im working for  are not letting anyone go  unless they get what they want from your boss  but i dont know anything  well maybe you know more thank you think  tell me about these properties you showed him  i showed him tons  i wouldnt even know where to begin  did he look at any place more than once  there there was a condo  he said that he needed something near the airport  time to go shopping  used in embassies to store secrets  burn safes depend on an internal ignition device  to start a fire  pump in liquid co2 and if you do it right  you can turn that ignition device into a popsicles  do it wrong  you turn everything inside the safe to a pile of ash  no ledger  but  natalie rice  he had her passport just like she said  our mystery man milovan dragas  hmm  who have we here  bennett tash  he must be very important to have made milovans burn safe  i got to tell you love the name  rolls off the tongue a lot easier than milovan  i want a cigarette  mm your life  what were you before you became a rich mans errand boy  a cop  we cracked your burn safe  so imagine whats gonna happen  when we get our hands on bennett tash  you know him  the fella whos gonna post the ledger on the web  good luck finding him in the yellow pages  i was wrong  you are an exmilitary  washed up soft now but i see it  okay thats enough  now my boss hes a reasonable man  he an make the arrangements to let you go  you just have to tell me where the ledger is before its too late  what were you a coast guard  try navy seal pal  navy seals little girl  son of a bitch  aah  pathetic  how stupid can you be  not stupid enough to put a loaded gun in your hand  have a seat  please  we got the name of the mystery man  milovan dragas  okay well thats good right  yeah well look normally what we would do  is comb through his bio create a psych profile  and try and break him in interrogation but  the guy was serbian intelligence  hes an interrogation specialist  what does that mean like hes unbreakable or something  can you do your thing see if tash has a paper trail  yeah whip up some barry computer magic  see if he rented an apartment  ordered a subscription to cat fancy  im on it  fi and i have to update strickler on the cleaner job  you okay alone here for a while  okay  cleaner scouted that driveway on the water  my guess is they exchange crates boat to truck  itll be hard doing surveillance out here in the open  well you set up for your photo shoot here  ill be sunbathing over there in a hat  if theres any trouble ill back you up  sorry to insist on a meet  im not usually this handson but its our maiden voyage  i want it to be perfect how we doing  well there are a couple things you could clear up for me  its bad form to ask for that kind of detail  like its bad form to just sit back and take photo  while lowlifes waltz away with this stuff  fi please you dont have a problem with this  im gonna go  you guys have much to discuss  gee i hope shes not getting cold feet for the operation  to important people on this job  ill handle it  so does this mean that you found what youre looking for  no not yet  youre not gonna let me see jared again  youre just youre stringing me along  look at me  you will see your son again  but you have to work with me to make that happen  this better be important  that guy bennett tash opened bank accounts in overtown  if we can get bennett  we an crack milovan and you can go free  but if milovan finds out that i told you  he controls you with fear  you need to be brave all right  tell jared youll be home soon  its a store front on poe street  hi its me  jared there  hi sweetie its mommy  mmhmm  so this is bennetts place  whats our approach  milovan keeps his business compartmentalized  nobody know each other lets use that  oh its the old were all in this together  i like it  yeah  yeah the boss sent us all hells breaking loose  we got to talk now boss got pinched  the whole damn networks in trouble let us in  yeah yeah come on come on come on in get off the street  could be dea fbi  he was picked up yesterday  weve been dark since  nobodys checked in with me either  i had a bad feeling but jesus this is bad  i need a drink  in any new situation where youre going in cold  you have to be alert to warning signs  the sound of mac10s bolt action for example  a mac10 an fire 50 rounds in a few seconds  but its one of the least accurate guns  in the hands of an amateur  survive the first burst and youve got a decent chance  you know you could use some time at the gun range bennett  stay on task wheres the ledger  i dont know man i just handle the buyer  the deals set for 500 this afternoon  im just waiting on a call to see where  yeah nice try  we know its

headsup  yeah she just turned down sherman way  nice work barry  fi you want to go in for a closer look  im on it  once you have eye on the target  its just a matter of handing off surveillance  at regular intervals  hey mikey aint she grand  turn it loose sam  hang behind your target too long  and theyll wonder why youre not passing  best way to avoid their suspicion  pass them  shes turning in

this job  but i dont want you to work with strikler  not now not ever  i cant help you with this  its a twoperson job i need you  ive seen the site you can handle yourself  im not worried about that

i just cant stay here in miami and watch  fi  fi  fiona  theres no greater luxury in the field  than working with a friend you rely on  when you find someone you can trust absolutely  you want them on every operation you do  and nothing hurts worse than losing a friend to bullets  but when you have to work alone again  you lock those feelings away and do the job at hand  because as every spy know  theres plenty of time to think about what youve lost  after the mission is over  did you shoot these with a tripod  i mean look at that photo  i should put you up for a job with national geographic  who drove away with the military equipment  gee i dont know  i hope one day theyre brought to justice  thee photo who are they for  you gonna get hung up on all these details now westen  come on  its
