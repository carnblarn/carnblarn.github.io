                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until    we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted     when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit nojob history   youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way   you rely on anyone whos still talking to you     a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fb i  you know spies bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  hey is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere   when meeting a covert operative for the first time  the arrangements can tell you a lot  if they give you a map and a photo they trust you  aplace and a time they want to check you out before they make contact  a cryptic clue like tidy pelican  theyvejust got an irritating sense ofhumor     youre not gonna win   go   next time then  you look like you could use a partner  tidy pelican cute  carla wanted to leave a harder clue for the crossword  you know how she loves these things  but i was worried itd go right over your head   love the shirt  careful  the last man who insulted me had to fish pieces of his tongue out of a garbage disposal   im kidding sit  dont worry its a nice public place  were just two guys talking sport call me victor  so what exactly do you do victor  you could think of me as a wrangler  i make sure the broncos dont buck too much wander from the pen   that kind of thing  like a rodeo clown   oh youve been a busy boy michael  sneaking around town breaking into peoples offices  tsk tsk tsk youve shown a lot of initiative  ive had a lot of time on my hands  wed like to put your talents back to good use   weve got a little operation and youre gonna help  and if im not interested  then i suppose we turn the screws until you get interested  my advice is dont make this more difficult than it has to be  meet your new best friend this stays with you at all times  i call you answer and no no you do not get a return number  you know i already have plenty of these things  and im not doing a job until i hear what it is   sometimes when you meet a new operative  its a good idea to open with an aggressive move  im sorry thats not how it works  you learn about people when you make them play defense  their reflexes weaknesses how they handle themselves under pressure  keep smiling sport just two guys talking  youll tell me about your bosses or i open your radial artery  my guess is youll tap out in a minute maybe two  mmm carla said you might be difficult  see mikey the people we work for theyre into the whole carrot and stick thing  and im the stick    22 it does some nasty things up close  itll probably tumble around your femoral artery  your uh your groin  now im no expert but uh my guess is you tap out first   and even if theyre able to counter  it never hurts to know how far theyre willing to go     new car sam   preowned  after the breakup veronica took the caddy back  so i used some savedup pension checks and bought this baby  it was tough but me and the buick were gonna get through it  howd your little spy meet go  seems the folks that burned me want me for a new errand  if the operative they sent is any indication its its heavy   and if you take a rain check  oh the usual  theyll work their way through my friends and family with a ninemillimeter  until i change my mind  sam this uh this could get bad  i need someone to go stay over at my moms just until i figure out whats going on  i wouldnt ask unless it was serious  serious like dont finish that beer serious   or go over there right after youre done    hey madeline  its sam axe oh im okay  you know ive been staying over at mikes place  ever since veronica and i broke up  and well hes getting tired of me moping around  and i just wanted to know if i could stay at your place for  just a couple of days while im on the mend  aw thanks madeline yeah mike wants to talk to you  hey mom   what are we up to here friend  whoa dude  little surveillance planting a bug   something more exotic maybe  what are you talking about i came to talk to michael   i am a friend of the family  mmhmm on your feet   i found the old vcr in the attic its good as new  just have to hook up these little things in the back   madeline there you are  hey  ricky you met sam  oh yeah we just had the pleasure  rickys older brother andre used to get in more trouble with michael  they were like frick and frack werent they honey   yes they were mrs westen   how about that huh  ricky came by to see michael but he was kind enough  to help me install my home theater system   so hows it comin ricky  well actually i think its time to upgrade  really its a perfectly good machine  sam whats this  well he was at your mas house when i got there  michael you remember ricky   ricky ricky watkins  yeah  long time right i heard you were back in town looking good man  whats andre up to   twentyfive to life up in starke  thats too bad  ricky thought itd be fun for the two of you to catch up   weve gotta get to that store  oh that vcr situation thats right   rightyo  wow we gotta do that   what you gonna  we gotta pick this thing up a little shoppin   you boys have fun okay   how you been ricky  oh man you wouldnt believe it  you probably remember me as that little screwup kid  tryin to raise hell like you and andre used to  its not like that anymore  put myself through school got a business degree  head accountant sweet valentine enterprises  you know valentine the hiphop mogul  uh the radio in my car is broken so  trust me its big  the thing is other day valentine calls me into his office  tells me theres two million missing from a charity account  i said it must be a mistake and ill look into it  moneys gone  my names on all the records  im being set up man  you have any idea who might be behind it  eddie ash valentines number two  only other cat with access to the accounts  hes been with valentine since the beginning  hes the only guy valentine really trusts  if i say anything im dead  dead that a figure of speech  valentine started as a gangster  if he thinks im stealing from him  nah i wouldnt last 15 minutes  what you need ricky is a forensic accountant  what i need is eddies books okay  if i get the records i give em to valentine im in the clear  eddie keeps em locked up in his office  and you want me to go in there and get it  look   i got 10000 here thats everything i got and you can have it  lets see how the job goes first all right   youve really never heard of valentine  havent had a lot of time for musical exploration fi  he has a clothing line too lingerie wonderful shoes   how much you payin me for this again  bought you the espresso  mmhmm     the man the man the man    deal you x   ima bat you around    yeah   i wanna bat you around    ima bat you around    yeah   i wanna bat you around    ima bat you around     i wanna bat you around   ima bat you around   i wanna bat you around    ima bat you around   im so bad   i wanna bat you around   ima bat you around   i wanna bat you around    ima bat you around   im so bad    thats eddie not a bad way to travel huh  we have to figure out how we can get in check out his security     ricky said yeah   hollywood beach 15 minutes     your new friend chatty isnt he   im gonna have to take care of this can you  run along  okay class is in session now listen carefully im only gonna say this once  there is a certain location  and from this location an item is being shipped to another location  whoa slow down  something is being shipped from somewhere to somewhere else i think i follow  now were going to hijack the something  whats the something  oh dear sounds like someones got a case of the need to knows  left untreated that could prove fatal michael  dismissed  traffic is brutal this time of day  you should probably hustle if youre headed back to uh     biscayne boulevard   you can use cell phone towers  to triangulate the position of someones cell phone  but youre going to have problems anytime they go out of range  use an enhanced gps on the other hand  and you can pinpoint their location in real time  almost anywhere on the face of the planet  try disconnecting a gps wired into a phones motherboard  you risk disabling the phone  a much simpler solution is call forwarding   rickys getting us the security code    so that should take care of the doors  there are cameras all around the building though   what kind of cameras  wireless nothing too hard to handle  of course the tactical support im giving you will cost you   i need new shoes  youve got plenty of shoes  now that im on the open market i need more      go go come on man   if you want to empty a building  pulling a fire alarm is useless  no one pays attention unless theyre actually on fire  a bomb scare next door to your target strikes the right balance  everyone clears out and then pays attention to the other building  impressive fi what did you tell them  that i was a disgruntled customer  disgruntled enough to hide a remoteactivated explosives device in the ladies room  theyre evacuating the entire block before they look for it bye   most modern bomb squads are equipped with an rf jammer  it blocks a wide spectrum of radio frequencies  preventing people from detonating bombs by remote control  itll block all electronic transmissions in the area  cell phones for example     or wireless security cameras    the interior locks in an office suite are usually lowend  just there to keep whitecollar workers from stealing coffee cups  file cabinet locking bars on the other hand  are a more serious security measure  their main vulnerability is that they depend on peoples faith in padlocks  people have too much faith in padlocks           hey hey why the hell you out here  the cops said we had to leave theres a bomb in the building  i dont care if theres a mushroom cloud youre paid to guard the building  now get your asses in there and guard it now     yall hear that   yeah what was that  think it came from in here   air ducts in a modern office are 18 inches wide  so if you need to make a quick escape and youre older than four you wont fit  a more viable option is the subceiling  once youre in the subceiling you can get to a bathroom or closet  and make your way out from there     uhuh this this cant be right man  there was nothing in the files   you sure you looked everywhere  im sure ricky  valentine is asking questions i dont think i can hold him off much longer  eddie has a prospectus for a tanning salon hes got another for a car wash  hes shopping for a way to launder his money  he did a pretty goodjob of making it look like you stole the money  but ifhe suddenly has two million dollars in his bank account   people are gonna ask questions  exactly  hes looking for a front business  a way to make it look like he actually earned this money  so he needs to clean his money how does that help me  im gonna talk to eddie  im gonna convince him he should wash his money with me  and that is something you can take to valentine  okay  i just want an introduction barry  chances are good that this guy eddie is talking to friends of yours  i just want to make my pitch  the next day you do the michael westen thing  stuff starts exploding and everyones saying  hey barry wasnt that guy a friend of yours   sorry no can do  sams working up a cover id for me  im just a guy from out of town a friend of a friend  the blow wont get back on you i give you my word   i guess i could work it through some intermediaries  yes   doable  yes   expensive  how much  to get someone to vouch for you put you in the room with the guy say five grand   promise nothin will happen to him maybe i can do three  five it is  okay  oh mike good timing check this out  madras curry  just take a little bit little sippy sip  mmm huh  your moms got me into these cooking shows its addictive as hell   oh  mmm   hows the protecting her from danger show  mmm i do a perimeter check once an hour  i just say that i need some alone time to ponder the whole veronica thing  works like a charm   what are you boys whispering about  nothing mom  okay  sam did you get a chance to do that cover id for me  yourejimmy glynn  flashy real estate developer cash churner  i threw in some vague boston mob connections just for good measure  what did i do oh here we are  heres your business card youre all set brother       when youre working a target its all about getting a good read  what makes him tick is he insecure does he have something to prove   you might only have a few seconds  what up  but it all factors into your approach   eddie ash right  you must bejimmy  good to meet you brother yeah guy yeah  youre in the music business right what are you a performer a rapper   i hear the ladies go crazy for the music types am i right  im in management   oh  id rather not talk about my business if you dont mind  not at all i hear that a lot in my line of work   lets get us some drinks sweet oh whoo   hey   johnnie walker blue on the rocks for me and my friend  you got it   be right back  wow they dont make em like that in beantown  i hear you have a pretty good real estate thing going on there   word is youre the best in the business  yeah you hear right  but in my line of work you gotta move with the economy  now i understand you wanna wash some bills  i might i might not   youre careful i like that  here you go  so look  what if i told you you could get a return on your investment in six months  comes back clean untraceable plus a 30 to 40 profit minus my cut    id ask about the catch  no catch  you get me by the end of the week two million dollars  two million this week   no worries brother yeah i hear this a lot  fellas got a couple hundred gs to move  thinks hes a player and he comes tojimmy  well jimmys a sevenfigures deependofthepool kind of guy  when you take off your floaties and wanna do some real business you come to me   im gonna get the check  hey hey all right all right  its not about the money all right sit  come on sit its just the time frame is all  what can i say my investment group we move fast  this is bigtime eddie  well id need to see where this real estate is  im not investing in something if i cant see it  i wouldnt want you to     theres nothing in the world easier to get into  than an empty condo thats been on the market for six months    never mind picking the lock you can just call and ask for the keys  the way the florida market is right now its a gold mine  im negotiating right now for this piece  i can pick this place up for 10 15 cents on the dollar   yeah but its empty  yeah thats the point  eddie listen i take your cash under the table  i buy granite countertops new appliances new carpetin  we flip the property cause theres no receipts theres no records  all that money comes back to you squeaky clean   all right ill think about it  dont think too long  i got a couple of guys lookin to move on this in 48 hours     are you in are you gonna be in     look at me you in  i gotta go i gotta run ill be in touch  eddie its not gonna last    yeah rick  valentine is calling everyone into the conference room  for an emergency meeting in 10 minutes and he is pissed  that must be where eddies heading whats going on  i dont know but it is not good what do i do man  its a risk but if you run youll be running for the rest of your life   its your call  all right ill go  leave the phone on im gonna go get fi were gonna be listening in   you got my back on this  were gonna do the best we can  but if it looks like somethings going bad down there get out    we should go in there one or two bullets in the right place  i think storming the building is probably not good for ricky long term fi   the meetings starting   loyalty  respect  standin tall  these are the bricks i used to build this label from the street up  without em  these platinum records got no place on my wall    yall a jumpy bunch today  anybody in here got a reason to be jumpy  last chance to come clean people  no im disappointed  though i cant say im surprised   marcus  hmm   you recognize this    aftershocks debut album double platinum   whose logo is that on this record  yours  mines and whose signature is on your paychecks  yours valentine  thats right so explain to me why you told static records  you could deliver aftershock if they brought you into the fold  static records man i dont even    oh  what  eddie saw you kickin it at they offices  you take my artists you take the cash out my pocket  eddie what do i do to thieves  what you have to valentine  what i have to rick what you think  i think youre in a conference room full of witnesses v   my man always appealing to my better half  you know what marcus get your ass outta here  you forgettin something homey  you wanted my record right   take it     hold on   damn valentine   somebody come clean this up everybody out    now lets go  fi  except you rick     wait damn it  fi  you figure out what happened to that guac ricky  yeah looks like it was a bank error  l im taking care of it v  wait  two days i need to see that cash  stand down   tell me you heard that  yeah we heard that  sounded like eddie was letting valentine know who he can trust  so when valentine finds that money gone  theres no question its me that gets capped  im not gonna let that happen im meeting eddie tonight       these are just boston numbers  miami numbers are gonna be even better bigger slide in the market  i know this is a big move for you eddie but i need a decision now   i need to approve spending  i want to know where my money is at any given point   you got it brother     for me but i didnt  uhhuh  would you uh hold this for a second  victor you should have called  i cant figure out how you misunderstood  this stays with you at all times  you ever pull another stunt like that michael and uh   well dont pull another stunt like that  a chevy impalas parked outside were going for a little ride tomorrow   doesnt that sound like fun  im busy tomorrow  yeah you have been spreading yourself kind of thin lately  i was just talking to your waitress michelle great gal  she tells me youre getting into real estate now too  youre a wicked skinner you know that jimmy  i talk to you now i got the fbi crawlin all over the place  oh whos this another investor  tell him if he dont want the feds camped out in his backyard  he should stay the hell away from jimmy glynn  so did that uh help clear up your schedule  see you tomorrow pal  whoa hold on hold on so hes not gonna move the money now   he thinks im under fbi investigation  fbi  im running out of time here man  valentine said what 48 hours  the most important thing is for you to stay calm fi can you  yeah ill take care of him  ricky we need to talk  do you get much of a discount on valentines clothing line    when your covers compromised    often the best defense is a good offense  admit nothing deny everything make counteraccusations  you friggin dubber i oughta wring your neck   what the hell did you do to me  what are you talkin about  i talk to you and suddenly feds on my ass   what are you saying  what do you have to say about that  they came to my office they came to my place of business   what the fbi are you serious  do i look like im joking  now i gotta kill my deals all my investors are lost  i gotta move my money offshore  do you know how much of a bath im gonna take  for puttin my money away where the feds cant find it  plus my sterling reputation   now im gonna ask you this just once    did you say anything to them   no no i didnt  they didnt talk to me i swear i swear   all right lets keep it that way    luckily movin money offshore is a jimmy glynn speciality  im sorry about the suit we gotta stick together on this pal okay  but if you hear anything you see anything you talk to me   you call me understood  yeah i understand   okay      sam i need a favor  i need you to take my mom on a field trip  i gotta go see what this victor projects about    thats what its all about all right man   see you around bye  yeah bye     once somebodys watching for cops  they see them everywhere  anyone in dark sunglasses is fbi  any car with tinted windows is a tail   their paranoia does most of the work for you    i still dont see the point of driving around taking pictures of hotels and condos  i mean you really want to find a new place  you know youre gonna have to eventually go inside one sam  i know i know its just that if i do     then it means its really over with veronica  its just one of those psychological things you know  i know i know i went through the same stuff when frank died  and its hard but you gotta move on  im just not ready   our shipments coming in tomorrow afternoon  itll be held in one of those loading bays there awaiting transfer  ill go in and cut the bolts on the door  and remove the object while you babysit the car and play lookout  weve got an hour window maybe less  you sure you dont want me to grab it  give you a chance to peek nice try though  well drive to the drop go our separate ways you ditch the car questions   just one what are we taking  its bigger than a bread box but itll fit in the trunk  thats all you need to know sport  that is not all i need to know victor  how heavy is the cargo  are we talking about a big metal container or something fragile  if its explosives it will affect how i drive  wooden crate no explosives dont worry your pretty little head   what about the guards  if they come by you give me the headsup   and then    i take care of them   knowing what someone wants  can tell you a lot about who they are  so if what they want comes in a wooden crate youre not going to be allowed to open  you might have to turn your trunk into a makeshift xray machine  the tube from an old tvset is a good place to start  as part of the projection process they emit xrays  theyre meant to handle around 30000 volts  any more than that and theyll cook your eyes with radiation  so pump a hundred thousand volts into one from a taser  and you wont be able to diagnose a hairline fracture  but youll get the basic idea     yeah jimmy here  its eddie we need to meet now  its just like you said jimmy  the fbis tailing me theyre taking pictures  before you said that you could move cash offshore  well with the feds circling i got enough heat movinmy own money  uh oh  please man you gotta help me   criminals are as a rule paranoid and selfserving  so if youre using a criminal cover id you cant be too helpful  sorry i wish i could help you guy i really do  but its risky too risky   luckily you can usually count on the other guy  not to let you off easy  all right well you know if the feds take my money  then uh i guess ill have to talk to them  and they seem pretty interested in you so it might be too risky to keep my mouth shut  hey hey hey no need for that  how do the seychelles sound to you  i got a bank out there works with me  fine that sounds fine  i just have one more loose end to tie up before i move the money  whoa loose end you said nobody else knew  they wont not for long  i got guys taking care of it right now   good for you look at you look at you movin up  right  hey we should have a party now i should call some ladies have em come over   lets toast get me a bottle get a new bottle out here  all right   sound good  sounds great    fi get over to rickys eddies sending a hit squad  yeah you call ricky you tell him to stay low find a good hiding place   if he shows up theyre gonna kill him  ill bring some firepower then  no no no it cant look like youre helping him  do something else anything else just do it now  watch yourself see anything    in any kind of covert operation    one of the toughest challenges is using information that youre not supposed to have  if going in guns blazing will blow your cover  sometimes youve gotta get creative  i know youre in there ricky you come on out and face me like a man   under the right circumstances a wellplaced rock     is as good as a bullet  come on       the good news is eddie believes hes being investigated by the fb i  and wants to move the money  the bad news is hes not gonna do it with you still alive ricky  so the only way to clear my name is to die a violent death  great  eddie has a ricky problem well help him solve it  can you find out when valentines leaving the office today   yeah    sam i need a favor can you stash my mom someplace safe for a couple ofhours    hey i reached out to some of my people  i found the source of your fbi problem  its an accountant named ricky watkins  yes damn it damn it  if youre gonna move the money youre gonna have to take him out  i know thats the loose end i was talking about okay  i sent guys but his girlfriend showed up or something the whole street saw em  looks like somebodys gonna have to get his hands dirty  what you mean me   do it myself  i got a gun i stole it from a coke dealer in boca  anybody traces it it looks like ricky was stealinto buy into the drug business  youll get away clean but you gotta do it right now  oh yeah all right i get it  cant do anything for yourself been living off of valentines table scraps for too long  hey you call this table scraps  this its limited edition ten people in the world have this watch     whats so funny  yeah you got the car you got the watch  but youre still livin like a rat in the shadows  not mannin up to your business   you shut your mouth  what are you gonna do  you gonna wait for your guys to come back into town  and hide behind them like a rat while they shoot    one of the most difficult skills to master in combat  is taking a dive  sometimes an operation demands that you lose a fight  but its the hardest thing in the world  to see the opening and let it go    all right all right okay okay okay  i can take care of my business just fine lets do this  all right  wheres the gun  merci beaucoup sugar blooms   hey i think i know you huh  arent you the singerrapper valentino valentine   yeah  i
