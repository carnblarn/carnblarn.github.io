                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you   a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  is that your mom again   if youre desperate  someone needs your help  bottom line as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  open up police  whether youre dealing with the presidential guard in belarus  the federal security service in russia or the local police in miami  the drill is pretty much the same  keep your place clean of damning evidence  keep your alibis and your whereabouts straight  and always be ready for surprise visits  nate what are you doing here  just giving you a little taste of what i woke up to this morning  i was dragged out of bed by someone very interested in you  mr westen you mind if i come in  by all means  you know if these visits become a habit  im gonna start thinking you like me  remember my partner detective lopez im not sure you two formally met  im glad youre here i got a gift for you  my daily activity log  we were just dropping nate off  just a way to say thank you for chatting to us about his big brother  and i thought it wouldnt hurt to see if you were free to answer some questions  im crazy busy  i need to finish my yogurt then i was planning on working out  well until your calendar clears up  just know im gonna make my way through every friend  relative and associate you have  let me save you some time my friends and family dont know anything  sooner or later someone will  when you want this to stop  how long you been in town  about 6 hours 5 of which were spent listening to your girlfriend over there  tell me that id fled to vegas to avoid some unpaid parking tickets  she was just trying to soften you up trying to get you to flip on me  yeah i figured that out after she said  it would go easier if i flipped on my brother  jesus bro i didnt say anything all right  do you know how hard it is not to talk about your extracurricular activities  drive me to moms my car is there i need to get to my meeting   meeting  limos bro  i came back to talk with investors about expanding my company  this is real  okay things are finally breaking my way  help me out  so nate didnt give her anything  if theres one thing nate knows how to do its avoid telling the truth  well thats good news for now  but how long before paxson finds someone you know that she can flip   like a gun runner named seymour  or a money launder named barry  or a washedup navy seal named sam   or how about an unstable jealous  guys  if paxsons going after everyone i know  i need to get to know someone shell regret going after  not a bad idea make it look like youre mixed up with someone with clout  maybe somebody from the mayors office  im thinking a financial relationship  something that looks very suspicious but isnt actually illegal  sounds fun  thanks sam  the lone spy who always works solo is a myth  the truth is you dont last long without keeping a few friends around  because your enemies will find you on their own  you wouldnt happen to know where i could find a burned spy would you  brennen  thats my way of saying thank you for the last time i saw you  well nice to see you too  although i thought youd still be running from those south americans  you know i would be  but it seems that a rival cartel  got an anonymous shipment of ak47s and rocket launchers  so those angry south americans were a little busy  what with all the killing and dying  you financed a private war so you could get back to miami why  an exciting business opportunity  a limo company  actually i think you might know the owner  nate youre nates investor  but not just me i have a partner  nates with him now doesnt nate look happy  closing his little deal  but he doesnt realize that his investor is an enforcer called the butcher   brought him over special for this  brennen if you  michael no its not up to me  whether nates meeting ends in a bullet or a handshake  is entirely up to you  youre gonna be running some errands for me today  just think of me as  your new boss  cellphone keys wallet and your sunglasses  i want to see those pretty eyes  lets go  youre certainly in a hurry is this job of yours timesensitive  listen to you  probing for intel from the getgo you are a sly one arent you  you could save me some time you could tell me what were doing  pass youre just a key michael  keys dont need to know whats behind the doors they unlock  now rules for the superspy i give orders you obey  you try to escape nate dies  fail to complete a task nate dies   refuse an order  i get it  but im not playing fetch until i know nates okay  michael we covered this the picture  that could have been taken hours ago prove nates alive or this ends here  well how about this you stop making demands or your life ends here  your first priority when youre captured  is to make it clear that your cooperation isnt free  your captor gets what he wants if you get what you want   get in the car  youre the one stopping me  prove to me im not wasting my time  in any healthy relationship there needs to be some give and take   one word  and nate dies  not right away of course  my partner is a man who really enjoys his work  yeah its me put our friend on  its for you   this is nate  nate westen simon davis  simon my man hey you heading over  i have errands to run but you can work out the broad strokes with my partner  be careful though he can be ruthless once he starts to work you over  yeah no im looking forward to the challenge   good buddy ill see you soon  all right  happy now get in the damn car  this is the house where the michael westen grew up huh  and now youre living here with his mom  im just crashing here for a while im just helping out with some repairs  its not like that   you got here fast barry  my salons in the neighborhood so  anyway so michaels got a cop problem  yeah its making life unpleasant for all of us   we need help to make it go away  okay well tiny issue all right  my life coach has strongly suggested  that i try and avoid stressful situations  barry were not asking you to storm the station  just open a joint bank account with mike  and a mayors aide  great why dont we just throw a judge in there while were at it  we called because she isnt just our problem  shes interrogating everybody in mikes life  you wanna find out the questions she has for his moneylaundering pal barry  heres what youre gonna do  go here and tell fabian  that im giving you the portable skimmer  fabian  i hired an intern  once your pretty little hands swipe that card  my pretty little hands are gonna do some financial magic  say barry before you and your hands get too busy  i thought you could help me out with a little homeimprovement project   so whos the guy with the purse  thats barry  what does he do  hes sams financial consultant  now you got to hold it up hold it in position  i got to put this thing up hold that down   were here  wheres here  see the building theres a hardware key in a desk in office 237  in about a half an hour its gonna be in my pocket  this gets you past security  besides the guards there should be nobody in the building on a sunday  i hope you know more about the building than my jacket size  superspy you got bigger things to worry about than how pretty you look  the offices are wired to the buildings alarms   you ready  how long do i have inside  if youre not gonna tell me what were doing here  just eat whats on your plate  one more thing  while youre in there  phone a friend write an email update your facebook status  i honestly dont care  as long as you remember what really matters here  i dont get what i want and your brother dies  now run along  spies are trained to use whatever resources are available  in the hills of afghanistan the best you can hope for  are rocks and some scrub brush  in an office building you may have more options  technology that makes communication easier  also tends to make it more vulnerable  the bluetooth on a cellphone for example  is an easy way to send information wirelessly over short distances  use an antenna and you can get that same information over longer distances  if you dont have an antenna you can build your own  a combination of metal washers and a bent coat hanger  connected to a cylindrical chip scan will allow you to capture the signal  a usb cable transmits the stolen information to a computer  add a few pencils for legs  and youve got a cute little improvised hacking device   what  hey watch that window  if anything goes wrong  ill knock it out and throw the hardware key down to you  fine just hurry up westen   what was that  nothing just part of the process  youre gonna have to start bringing the second man to this twoman job  sam what did you break it  no no no its fine very sturdy wood and glass  i dont have a lot of time remember brennen  yeah the arms dealer liked to strap bombs to kids  yeah hes back and hes threatening to kill nate  unless i steal something for him some kind of hightech equipment  why dont you show maddie our progress and ill be right back   are you okay is nate okay  im fine nate was 35 minutes ago   thats all i know  what can i do  i just hacked brennens cell i emailed you everything on it  you need to comb through the addresses text messages and phone calls   you wanna know what hes after  i wanna know everything  i wanna know who his buyer is where hes got nate  what orange juice he drinks in the morning   im on it  you better hurry  cause i get the feeling brennens got the westen  fitted for body bags  nothing sells innocence like an injury  people naturally sympathize with someone whos bleeding  if youre in a situation where you need the benefit of the doubt  its worth a flesh wound  what the hell did you do  i was moving the rack and it fell into the window   it just tipped over  yeah i was  the squeegee blade fell and i went to get it and i hit it and it fell   are you trying to pull something  no come on man i  the blade came off and it fell  rick kill the alarm   did you go into that office  no i only do the hallways so i  what the hell is this  i was picking up glass and i cut myself   okay whats your name  johnny john dickson  and i do the windows and im gonna get a vacuum and im gonna clean this up  johnny no youre gonna stay right here  whenever theres an alarm we have to call the police building procedure  you dont have to do that no listen you dont have to do that   its simple glass it fell  are you drunk  dont lie to me i can smell it on you  wait just hold on please  this job is all i got  and if i miss a childsupport payment  my ex will take the kids to flagstaff with her boyfriend  i messed up  and i am sorry  but ill make it right if you just let this one slide  look you call somebody to pick you up  thank you  thank you  so  whats next  in the adrenaline rush of a highstress situation  you tend to miss details  but its the little things that make all the difference  you keep looking at me that way youll have to buy me dinner  sig 226  thats an impressive piece of hardware  it is  whats that tell you about me  that i feel the need to appear powerful  and intimidating i see youre still a sharp dresser  is that brioni  come on now what is that gonna tell you about me  its already well established i like nice things  and pretty things  who gave you the tie pin your wife  married please  and enough with the digging youre boring me  heres how this is gonna work  the guy in that house has a voice  you have a voice recorder youre gonna put the two together  you want to be more specific  do you want his favorite bible verses freestyle rap   full name every number 0 through 9  someones making a voice key  ding ding michael westen  his names jonathan carver a man  with the right clearance at the right company a employee  who doesnt have a family a dog or an adt account  thanks for making it easy on me  actually i understand hes a bit of a gun nut  which means hes less likely to call the cops  and more likely to just shoot you  so good luck with that  do you have a carrepair kit  a tire iron is great if you need a new tire  its also great if you need a car  because a tire iron can be used to break a window  and pry open the steering column to expose the ignition leads  its the ultimate allpurpose tool  oh man i am so sorry  this cat ran right in front of me  the cat cost you 2 grand  at least look at this damage  oh man  i left my wallet in my jacket at home and the insurance card is in my wallet   are you trying to get out of this  no man  ill call my insurance company and theyll totally have my  my info  and i left my cellphone in my jacket   can i use  you can use mine  thats great thanks  do you have pen and paper  phones in there  you sure do buy a lot of guns mr  i dont buy guns i make them  whats this one here a 357 you make this one  its a 45 and no   what about this little tiny one  its a ruger   but what kind of bullets does it use  i thought you wanted to use the phone  youre an engineer of guns whered you go mit  state  i was at the u of m i graduated    whatd you have like a 40  3 something   31 32 33  39 what does it matter  do you want me to get the phone  let me get your name first and then before i call them  jonathan carver  whats that mr carpenter  its carver and its threeohfive  threezerofive  threeohfive  you mean threezerofive  yes threezerofive  will you stop interrupting me  sure thanks  so whats that  that is an international transfer charge   that means brennens moved money  wait   its me  whats brennen got you doing  i just finished stealing a hardware key with an agency routing code  and now  now im hanging out with a gun designer named jonathan carver  collecting numbers for a voice key  sounds like brennens after some governmentfunded weapon  how are we doing with brennens phone  could be better i mean its less than a week old  i mean this weasels pretty careful  deletes his text messages theres no contacts list either   what about his call log  call log  so there i think we got a little bit of good news  brennen placed a bunch of calls to hamstead bank and trust   he used his phone to enter his pin  so barry got into his account  brennens moving a lot of money mostly to  other banks some numbered accounts and a company called  onyx international  barrys working on it  look for any rent or mortgage payments  if brennens got a place in miami theres a good bet nates there  what are you trying to pull  that sure as hell aint your insurance company  one great thing about stealing information  is that nobody knows its gone  steal someones purse and youre probably in  for a lot of screaming  but steal someones creditcard number  and half the time they thank you  how was your meal  let me take this for you  im sorry  i know youre not our waitress  but my friends in a hurry  can i give it to you  fi where you been  skimming   i got the debit card info from  i need you to meet me right now  what why  we got a situation mikes in trouble  how soon can you meet me at 115 island  ill be there in 10  i dont know who you are  i dont know what youre doing but youre done lying to me  involving civilians in operations is dangerous  but sometimes necessary  i want 2 grand in cash  and your car stays right here until i get it  hang on  when it happens you do what you can to keep the civilian out of harms way  you know this is your fault just as much as it is mine  that said you try a little harder with some civilians than others  look at your car  that car is 8 inches from the curb  and its supposed to only be  what are you talking about  look at your car its in the middle of the street  look at it and youre getting in my face  it is supposed to only be 6 inches from the curb  say its 8 inches from the curb say it   get off me  i will  ill get off of you when you admit it just admit it  your car is 8 inches from the curb say it  ill let you go if you say it  your car is 8 inches from the curb say it  all right its 8 inches all right   what  its 8 inches from the curb   you crazy son of a bitch  thank you  its 8 inches from the curb you crazy son of a bitch  quite the performance howd we do  great but we need to go  now  jla industries  youre forcing me to break into a weapons manufacturer  forcing such an ugly word  encouraging  incentivizing  no youre right lets go with forcing  anyway theres a box  in rd lab 422  gray about yea big   go fetch  whats in the box  for our purposes it couldnt matter less  if you want me to go it couldnt matter more  anything could be in that box im not handing over a nuke  to save one life  even if it is my brothers  you want me to fetch  youll tell me whats in the box and where its headed  im pretty sure i can get you  to go get it without telling you a damn thing   yeah whats up  put him on  hey mr davis hows it going  hey nate good good  listen i had a question for you  are you one of those people who agrees to see a job through   and then reneges  of course not  is there a problem  no its just i hate working with people like that  it makes me crazy its just one of those things  it makes me want to kill someone  mr davis trust me i wouldnt waste your time or mine  good good  because i take my agreements very seriously  and i like working with people who do the same life is too short  life is too short  could you put my partner on   what do you want me to do  stay on the line  were deciding whether little brother lives through the phone call  mr westen  i love my brother brennen  but theres one thing that gets me into that building  the problem with blackmail is that its like a gun with only one bullet  you cant waste that bullet on every little problem  and the closer you get to your goal   the harder it is to pull the trigger   keep him busy ill call you later  right  dont flatter yourself westen its not a nuke  its a biometric lock for advanced infantry weapons  people will go on killing each other in little wars all around the globe  whether or not you steal it  the only difference is how much money i make while they do it  fine i do this  nate is released unhurt and i never see you again  done  an hour from now im a guy who sends you meanspirited christmas cards   what am i looking at in there  a twoman security team  you cant go around them youve got to go through them  looks like ill need that tire iron again  i like where your head is at westen  if you had to choose an ideal environment for guerilla war  it would probably look a lot like an urban parking structure  its an easy place to create a distraction  and draw out opposing forces  check that out  a parking garage is also a great place to control visibility  and give yourself an advantage  and once you do that  you can find cover and stage an effective ambush  dont struggle i dont want to hurt you  hello   security can i help you  yeah i work on the third floor  and im trying to get to my car in the garage but the power is out  one guard went into the electrical room but its been a while  and its still dark down here   ill be right there  thank you  yeah just got here   well fingers crossed  nate better be here barry has run out of addresses to check  second story back door thats our way in  charlie  you in here  charlie you in  yeah that move only works before youre in a choke hold  just relax  just relax go to sleep  nightnight  ladies first  someones been shopping  nate was here fi  we just missed him this

well check for any addresses we might have missed were gonna find him  nate  dont bother sam i just did  doing deals over the phone is so impersonal  seriously its not a problem you know i feel the same way  if were gonna be business partners we got to get to know each other  you know what i mean we got to be  like brothers is that what you were thinking   whats he doing here  you know  ill bet michaels thinking the same thing about you   what  you see its always at the end  when everythings coming together that people start making desperate moves  nate youre here to discourage stupid decisions  and to show that i dont make idle threats   youre good right there  my arm   stay still stay still  calm down  i used one of those nifty frangible rounds  a lot of softtissue damage but it doesnt usually kill   you didnt need to do that  actually i did  its called a countermove  you just had to know what was in the box  so i just had to show you who was in charge  now assuming you can read a map  just follow that red line right to my new beach house  hardware key gets you into the rd area  carvers voice recognition gets you into the lab  i cut it  while you were with the guards  he needs to get to a hospital you nicked an artery  his needs will be met just as soon as mine are  i promise  oh and westen dont dawdle otherwise im switching to lead  jonathan carver sevenonethreefoureight   mike what happened  brennen brought nate and shot him  shot him   jesus is he  no hes hurt bad  it was just brennens version of a pep talk  if we dont find something against him ill have to give him what he wants  you give him what he wants hell kill you both  im running out of options sam is there anything that we missed  nothing good you know  most of brennens bank records point to some north african buyer  so unless youre planning a trip to cairo  what else  a few llcs havent been touched in years  this onyx international  some s corp looks like a tax shelter  tell me about onyx international  well its more like a russian nesting doll than a company  you know i dug through nine subsidiaries in six countries  all i got was belle anna holding out of zurich   he sends 40k every 6 months  a lot of work to hide 80 grand a year  no kidding theres no business records either for belle anna  mike thats it thats all there is  mike you still there  he had a tie clip looked like a gift  didnt want to talk about his family  belle anna holding   i think i might know what it is  you think or you know  somewhere in between  does fi have any c4  its fi mike you got to ask  can you walk barry through intercepting a call in 10 minutes  thats gonna be tight but yeah sure  sounds like youve got something good mike  this is just outside of my comfort zone okay  im just saying im not great with british dialects  theres no other way barry mikes counting on you  just breathe barry itll all be fine  how big do we want this  well enough to make a point   but not kill the neighbors  really  should be good then  tell me this is a joke  was i unclear about the situation here  no you were very clear i had the box in my hands  then i decided  you never will ever  jesus fi i told you not to kill the neighbors  you told me to make a point  take your picture  we should go  get it now  oh god please dont  im through playing games westen  i think you got a text message   it can wait  no it cant   what the hell is this  its your house i believe  you did this  you found my place in miami and blew it up   if thats all youve got  oh thats not all  since we last met i became an expert on tyler brennen  i know all about you where you clean your teeth where you do your banking  did your banking i drained the accounts  that is a desperate bluff   a for effort but  i probably wouldnt believe me either  hamstead bank and trust has some fine security  but if you want to make a quick call put your mind at ease ill wait  hamstead are you currently banking with us  yes i need to check my balance  account number 06101966   pin 1208  1208  one moment  mr brennen  are you calling about this mornings transfer   transfer  yes at 1100am local time  out of this
