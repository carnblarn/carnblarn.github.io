                my name is michael westen i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing   no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  previously on burn notice  mike what the hell is going on over there  sam you know that prisoner we tried to keep from escaping  dont tell me  hes out sam hes free  his names simon thats all i know  madeline westen  yes fbi  i saw your son attack a police officer mrs westen  your son shot at me he tried to kill me  you have no idea who your own son really is  if michael wanted to kill you youd be dead  you are under arrest  me and fi want to talk to you  about this whole business with simon  no more lonewolf crap  we gotta know that youre with us  im with you good  were gonna be careful were gonna watch each others backs  combat knives for everyone just in case  sorry guys  was that an apology  michael westen  im calling about a former employee of yours   simon  simon got away  hes with management  im going after him  no we talked about this were in this together  you cant follow me this time fi  put the gun down  oh he owes you now boy  its just a matter of time  till youre just like me  just like me  just like me  wheres my son  i have no idea  god only knows what hole hes in now  he is gone  name brands and decor can often tell you a lot  about who youre dealing with  official agencies operate with government budgets  you can usually rule out the idea of federal involvement  as soon as you see a pricey antique  or a pair of 1200 shoes  michael westen  in the flesh  its an honor truly  hey have a piece of fruit  we get the best tangerines here  where am i  ah well  some folks call it a private holding facility  others a secret prison  andi think its officially listed  as a documentprocessing center  so you can take your pick  here have a tangerine  im not hungry  why am i here  we have a lot to talk about  that business between simon and management  its the tip of a very nasty iceberg  great work by the way  rescuing the old man like you did  trust me i didnt do it for him  but you did it  and now hes back  at an undisclosed location  and simon is locked away tight   all thanks to michael westen  i know youre upset that we burned you  but its nice to know that we can work together sometimes  when it counts  huh  friends at last  im not your friend  ill try not to take that personally  now youve had a long day  heres some reading material  to pass the time  i think youll find that interesting  let me know when youre ready to talk  it takes a while to learn how to read intelligence files  they start as stacks of unrelated documents  but stick with it long enough and a pattern can emerge  of course not all intelligence is reliable  which means when youre done checking the file  you have to check the source  guard  i read your file what does it all mean  why dont you tell me  come sit  assassinations crop burnings  little wars around the world  all connected to some fat bank accounts  very interesting  what does it have to do with me  well that depends  depends on what  on whether we can work together  we need your help michael  ha ha  you need my help  see all this  were trying to stop it  and whoever owns those fat bank accounts is fighting back  simons escape wasnt some kind of accident  it was an attack  against us  who is us exactly  theres some things governments do well  like run a military or a post office  and then there are some things that they need help with  things best done by people who  no longer have official ties to the government  like burned spies precisely  and thats where we come in  where you come in  i know you have a lot of connections  i find it hard to believe  that you cant do this without me  listen michael  if this was some foreign government  you might be right  were good at that sort of thing  but this   this is a new kind of problem  this is somebody willing to let a guy like simon blow up miami  to protect his cash flow  i mean bottom line  you may not like it  but were on the same side here  forgive me if im a little skeptical about that  look i know youve had bad experiences  with some of our operatives  look and a few turned out to be unstable corrupt  occasionally psychopathic but the point is michael  thats over  theres a reason why we recruited you  im glad you changed your hiring policies  but flatterys not gonna make me work for you  nobodys making you do anything michael  look i understand your reservations  i mean we burned you  and our methods   well lets just say we draw the line at different places  but at the end of the day  youre gonna want to side with us  rather than whoevers behind all of this  and we need to find him  im gonna be your errand boy  not an errand boy michael  a partner  now you wanted the file  where would you start  when you peel away the shell companies  and the dummy bank accounts  a lot of these little wars  all track back to the same weapon supplier  gregory hart  he uses a sat phone to do his banking  you can find him with that  if i were you i would talk to him  why dont we talk to him together  ill set it up  well go down and see what he has to say  and then you can decide whether  youre in or out  first time out of miami in a while huh  hows it feel  lovely  weve got hart in the guerilla camp up the road  sounds like theyre ready for us  hey i said its a new day didnt i  hey you want to shoot me go for it  ill take a rain check  yeah thats the spirit  all right lets do this  illegalweapon sales is a multimilliondollar industry  for a bigtime gun runner  its easy to live the life of luxury  the problem is  when youve spent your career dodging local law enforcement  and making mortal enemies  its much safer hiding in a tent in the jungle  than enjoying a piece of beachfront property  congratulations you got me  i assume you want to talk to me so whats on your mind  well lets start with who do you work for  this is gonna be a very disappointing conversation  for you cause i dont know anything  yeah well you can do better than that  these weapons came from someplace  theyre going someplace  now who do you work for  i work for a 16digit swiss bank account  and an anonymous email address  huh  vaughn  aah  do you think thats gonna do any good  i work for a man who values his privacy  now you can shoot me as much as you want  but its not gonna do any good  cause i was a dead man  the moment you started coming for me  we gotta go now  with thermal imaging  and lasertarget designators  an unmanned drone allows your enemy  to launch a precise strike  while staying completely anonymous  all you really know is that whoever youre up against  has deep pockets  and isnt afraid of tying up loose ends  surviving a drone attack  is about escaping the primary target area  that being said  dodging bullets and antitank missiles  isnt exactly a walk in the park  okay michael  are you in or are you out    my my my  it is nice to be out of the jungle  and how was your flight by the way  fine i love spending 10 hours in the cargo bay  hows the shoulder  well my dreams of pitching for the yankees are over  this isnt the first time  this sort of thing has happened michael  whoevers behind all this is killing our people  and not just ours  cia german intelligence   anyone who gets close gets dead  so now its my turn  im not gonna lie its dangerous  but were betting that michael westen can succeed  where others have failed  so you see what were up against  simon the file and this business with hart  you feeling helpful  hart had a government file with them  something i noticed when you were shooting holes  in his lower extremities  if i had to guess  id say he was the subject  of some kind of federal investigation  i love it  hey were a team already  just so we understand each other   this is my investigation  simon came after me you asked for my help  we do it my way  understood  theres a car waiting for you outside  say hello to your mother for me  mom  welcome home michael  when i got the call that you were coming back  the guy on the phone was a little vague  i wasnt entirely sure they werent shipping pieces of you  back in a cardboard box  i think im all here  well its good to have you home  want a tunafish sandwich  maybe later  have you heard from fi um  i left a message that you were coming home but  no we havent talked  i think shes probably just taking some time  to herself to  sort through all this you know  you really should go see her michael  im sorry mom  about everything  go  well talk later  the strain of having a loved one disappear for weeks  affects people differently  spend enough time as a covert operative  and you know better than to try to predict  the outcome of a longawaited reunion  michael  thank god  of course some reunions are more unpredictable than others  fi  im sorry were in the middle of something  here load this  sam and i took a case  and its gotten a little out of hand  our client is this lawyer winston  he was uh helping this girl with her ex  the uh restraining order didnt work  so he got this judge to impound the guys bike  but the guy turned out to be the enforcer of the breakers  breakers biker gang  baddest in south florida  they greenlit winston  i guess he had the bright idea  to try to pay the guy to leave him alone  oh thats sam  come on  lets go  fi   missed you brother  you and i are gonna get a beer together  just as soon as this little disaster of fionas is handled  i promise my disaster  youre the one who thought he could call the cops  to solve this whole thing  ha for the record they arrested two guys  bikers dont care if they get arrested  my point is calling the cops  was a lot more effective than your genius idea  fi i  have some biker friends  i made some calls  see if they can help out a little  maybe get some firepower  yeah right and they got their butts kicked  from here to shreveport  guys guys  i have a loaded machine pistol in my hand  and i have no idea what im doing  okay heres the short version  this biker guy hunter is at the lawyers place  andhe brought a posse  posse yeah  two maybe three i think it was two  anyway when winston called he was a mess  so we got to get him out of there  without making the situation even worse than it is  bottom line here mike   this whole business needs a little michael westen  get out here  this is everything i have okay this is all my money  take it and go away  you think i want your money  the tough thing about being marked for death  by a criminal organization  is the fact that once the order is given  the whole organizations after you  it ceases to be about an individual  and becomes about the honor of the group  and when honor is involved things tend to get bloody  youre a dead man  you hear me  dead  please thats everything i got  no stop dont do that  get out or were coming in  stay here  are you sure mike yeah sam  this isnt a situation we want to shoot it out  im gonna see if i can bluff it  bluff it  well at least take some better cards  all right hang back  dont make a move unless things go bad  and if things go bad  well it was nice seeing you guys again  im gonna give you 10 seconds   please   who the hell are you  im the guy telling you to get the hell out of here now  is that so  i count three of us and one of you  i like that math pal  heres some math  you got semiautomatic 45 caliber pistols  me mac10s on full auto  i fire five rounds at every one of yours  i can still drop you  and ill at least take two of you with me  you like those odds go for it  you know who youre messing with  your little buddy in there  has got every breaker in five states coming for him   coming hard  i know exactly who im messing with  and ill pretend that means something  for three more seconds  well be back pal  count on it  okay  so whos that guy again  im sorry about all that  we told winston to stay out of sight  but you know i guess they didnt go over  negotiating with biker gangs in law school  what  nothing  are you pouting  what you think i just moved on with my life  is that it  well i mean i disappeared fi  i come back and you and sam are taking clients  acting like nothing ever happened  oh dont you dare say that  dont you dare  sam and i kicked in every door we could think of  we took a client out of respect for you  because we knew thats what you would have wanted  well  lets do this right  welcome home  sighs   oh what happened to you  knowing you i dont know if i should be more concerned  about where you were or why youre back  i guess saving management earned me a little trust  im working on something  whoever let simon loose  is involved in something much bigger   some kind of international warforprofit scheme  im looking into it  ive seen firsthand what im up against  one fight at a time fi  hope you know what youre doing  go on up ill get the charger  all right just slowdown  well figure this out how  i gave the guy my life savings  he burned it on my lawn  any rational human being would at least   did hunter seem like a rational human being to you  no no i guess not  okay look these are not the type of folks  that you can bargain with  you know im starting to get the feeling  that maybe this looking for help thing  was not such a good idea  maybe i should  i dont know   just go to mexico or something  that wont solve anything  once youre greenlit youre greenlit  every member of the gang is supposed to kill you on sight  and if youre not around chances are  theyll find anyone they can   a relative friend  all i did was help this woman get away from her boyfriend  what do we know about the breakers  well aside from them trying to kill winston  not a lot you know  theyve had their runins with the law  but all i can get out of my cop pals  is that they run an operation out of a bar down in homestead  boss is a guy named big ed  apparently hes quite large  well have to make a deal with big ed  to call hunter off  what are you talking about  what just said we cant bargain with them  we cant bargain with hunter  big ed runs the gang  hes the one who can turn off the green light  well why would he do that  well have to make sure that keeping you alive  is in the best interests of the breakers  ah that easy huh  call barry  see the good thing about a biker gang   an outlaw biker gang   is that the club owns everything  members sign over all their assets  like a cult or a bad marriage  and this is a good thingwhy  well it makes it easier  to make it look like winston is mixed up with the gang  all we have to do is sign over some of winstons assets  to the breakers   make it look like he was running guns for them or drugs  go with gun running  just enough so that if they kill winston  itll be an opening for the fbi to take the breakers down  what do you need  their account numbers  im gonna work a little barry magic  make it impossible for them to tell where winston begins  and the breakers motorcycle club ends  well according to my cop buddies  the clubs office is up on the second floor above the bar  but its crawling with bikers and its locked up tight  only the top brass in the gang has access  i guess well have to get a little access of our own  infiltrating a hostile environment  that reeks of testosterone and motor oil is tough  unless youre an attractive woman  the gender advantage ends at the door however  its tough to pull off surveillance  when everyone wants to talk to you  hey  i aint seen you around before  well i aint been around before  i just moved here  and i heard that the breakers  were the hardest crew around  yeah you heard right  im earl nice to have a friend earl  is that who i think it is  who big ed yeah  want me to introduce you  no thats okay honey  i like to make my own first impressions  but i will catch up with you later  promise  surveillance isnt always about learning secrets  relationships are often just as important  im telling you  he disrespected you he disrespected us  he should already be dead by now  i know  im working on it  the guy had some muscle of his own  this dude was strapped  its my job to protect this club  we have a reputation  i dont care who he was or what he was packing  the next guy that steps between you and that lawyer  gets a bullet in the face  you understand  what the hell are you doing  what do you think youre doing  hey  you cant be in here  oh just finding us someplace private  where we could be alone all right  you want to see what i brought for us to play with  oh yeah  uhhuh  okay  most digital cameras arent intended  to take clear pictures of documents  a handheld scanner on the other hand  will prevent any contrast or blurring problems  earl earl you in there  earl  if youve got a smallenough frame  an oldfashioned ventilation system  can provide a decent escape route  earl what the hell  whats going on earl are you all right  and itll keep biggerboned pursuers from following  i still dont understand how this is gonna help  okay i want to get away from these guys  listen man its simple  financially we mix you up with every nasty thing  this gang is doing  that way if they take a shot at you  theyre just inviting the fbi to investigate the gang  i dont think hunters gonna care  the cops already   they dont care about a few of their members getting arrested  but theyll feel differently  about a massive federal investigation  destroying the breakers forever  what youre just gonna talk to em  not exactly  we just need to get him to where hes unprotected  and talk some sense into him  oh unprotected are you kidding me  i went through all the mortgages linked to the account  hes got a place up in boca where he stashes his girlfriend  you two deal with the paperwork  we will deal with big ed  yeah  michael its vaughn  i was wondering if you could stop by  got some news youre gonna want to hear  drink michael  im good thanks  you were right on the money about harts government file  he was being investigated by a counterintelligence group  with an annex near a miami military base  youll need to get into the system  and find out what they have  heres a ticket in  it should give you access to everything you need  dont push it  you have two minutes give or take  and remember if anything goes wrong  youre just a burned spy  caught with your hand in the cookie jar  are we done  i have some things to take care of  yeah right  i heard youre mixing up with a biker gang  all right well get back to work robin hood  dont get shot  weve got a lot of work to do  so this is big eds house huh  i guess it pays to be the boss  this is big eds girlfriends house  he has another house down in south miami  i see  ill take the front door you take the side  you got it mikey  and remember  we just want to have a nice polite conversation with him  after we kidnap him  of course  keep your head down  its best to breach a building from two directions  that way your target has to choose to defend the front  or the back  if you time it right both answers will be wrong  nobody move  what the hell  look when i said nobody move i was talking to you lady  ed whats going on  just hold on a minute  do you have any idea who youre messing with  nobodys messing with anyone we just want to talk  talk huh  ed this son of a bitch wont get his shotgun out of my face  thats far enough right there  i never hit a lady and i dont want to start  now back off  ohh  it doesnt matter how big someone is  there are certain points on the human body  that are vulnerable  ohh  pressure on the carotid artery will knock someone out  in 10 seconds no matter how big they are  of course if theyre big enough  it can be a pretty unpleasant 10 seconds  hows it going  hey fi  well i wont be sleeping on my back for a while  but we got big ed ready for his conversation  well good luck with that  hows it going there any movement  nothing unusual for now  well if they start pulling guns and rolling out   let you know and get out of here  i got it  you sons of bitches youre all dead  oh yeah we can hear you  what the hell do you people want  big ed i want you to meet winston  winston  youre the lawyer that punked hunter right  something like that  and now hunter wants to kill him for it  yeah i heard it was all over a piece of tail too  i helped her i would do it again  well i hope youre happy little man  cause now youre greenlit  and it aint just hunter after you  its the whole club  its about the honor of the breakers  you want to put a bullet in me you go ahead  it wont make any difference  youre dead  okay lets say hes dead  uh could we not  shut up  let me explain to you  what happens the day winston here dies  the feds will find that he was involved  with every single financial transaction  the breakers have done in the past year  what are you talking about  i dont know this guy  yeah whys he driving your car  says right here you own his 98 honda  i mean hell he paid for your fillings  it says hes involved in everything you do  and im sure the ate would be very interested to know  how winston here  who on paper is your most reliable gun runner  ended up dead  anything happens to winston  its gonna open the door for a bigtime investigation  big ed you might be willing to die  for the honor of the breakers  tell me this  wheres the honor  when every single chapter of the breakers  will go down for conspiring in this mans murder  its your call  destroy everything to kill a man youve never met  or call hunter off and you all continue to ride  who are you why are you doing this  im a man of honor just like you  get me a phone  hunter  yeah its ed  listen meet me at my old ladys house  come alone  whats going on  im calling off the green light on the lawyer  what  okay cccant we just go  not until its over  we got to make sure its settled  fi said hunter left the bar about 20 minutes ago  he should be here  one of the most dangerous times in war  is when peace negotiations begin  until both sides agree on terms  youre sitting on a powder keg  you know negotiations are off to a bad start  when people cant even agree on terms with their own side  thought i told you to come alone  yeah well maybe you shouldnt be giving orders anymore  hunter do you know what youre saying  youve gone soft old man  were not letting that little bitch winston walk  you gave the green light to take him out yeah  and now im turning it off  uh mike is this how its supposed to go  cause i dont think this is how its supposed to go  what you said that   its not an exact science  its not worth it  oh its worth it to me  its not your call  so stand down  or what  stand down or what  start the car sam  youre dead pull a gun on me  all right lets get in there  open the door  what do we do now  plan b  whats plan b  imworking on it  keep your head down  losing blood put pressure on the wound  no way hunters gonna back off now  he shot me  all hes got left is to finish the job  are the breakers with you or are they with him  theyre with me  theyre not here he is  fi  i need you to get all the breakers  and head over to biscayne highway right now  well i thought you wanted me to keep them away  well things have changed  all right  no need to raise your voice at me  hey thats the chick  thats the chick that tased me  come and get it boys  chasing a car with a motorcycle is a tricky thing to pull off  son of a bitch  the obvious thing to do  is shoot out the cars tires  problem is its a very difficult shot  unless youre alongside the car  unfortunately its also pretty tough  to hit a highpowered motorcycle  when youre in a swerving car thats taking fire  im out of ammo  where the hell is fiona  shell be here  never been happier to see that girl in my entire life  hang on  sam i hope you have a plan  yeah kinda  uh mike not liking the surrounded by biker thing  its fine sam  we made a deal right  yeah  easy boys  its ed hey its big ed  stand down  aah aah  you get out here  get his cut  everybody  listen up  anybody touches him anybody even looks at him funny  you get what this guy gets here  if anybody has a problem with that  speak up now  you three  i dont know who you are or where you came from  but i never want to see your faces again  right back at ya sounds good  get this son of a bitch off the road  nice ink  thanks  guess it makes me uh untouchable or something  i just kind of wish it wasnt so big  ah its a small price to pay yeah  still dont know how im gonna explain it to my mom  you can tell her it was that or certain death  im sure shell understand  listen um im sorry i doubted you guys there  and  you should keep that guy michael around  you make a great team  thank you  hey have fun with that  yeah  ohh god  as a spy you dont have to explain yourself much   you can disappear for a month and nobody asks questions  for a certain kind of person thats one of the perks  of going into the intelligence business  as a civilian you dont have that luxury  eventually people expect a good explanation  when you disappear  whether or not you have one  hello there michael  hey mom  to what do i owe the pleasure  well i thought we should talk  i know that uh  it wasnt easy while i was away  having you gone is something ive gotten used to  you know what was hard  having an fbi agent in my house  telling me that youre a monster  i still dont know whats going on  i was chasing a man named simon  he started off years ago as someone who did what i did  something happened he changed and  he hurt people  and a lot of the things he did got blamed on me  and how is that possible michael  if you werent there  i spent my entire career officially being nowhere  so its not hard to pin things on someone  whose job is to never have an alibi  well the other things that he said  you blew up a bridge  you shot at police  you didnt do that  yeah i did  i had to get simon  he was going to hurt more people if i didnt stop him  so i broke the law  i worked with bad people  i did it because i had to  thats it  its as simple as that  i dont know  he laughed  when i caught simon he laughed  he said it was just a matter of time  before i was just like him  hes wrong honey  that isnt the son i raised  so youre going in there  seriously michael its not too late to change your mind  i need to do this fi  because of simon  you caught him its over  its not over  i need to find whoever helped him get out  i saw the files fi  its part of something bigger a lot of people are dying  and you have to stop it  i dont see anyone else volunteering  last i checked  i was the one sitting in a getaway car  outside a secure military facility  that you were about to sneak into  i may not like the idea  but i think i deserve a little credit for showing up  thank you  thank you fi  most military bases have a civilian admin facility nearby  theyre simple places   just office buildings filled with cubicles  still theyre not places you just want to walk into casually  as a burned spy  how we doing out there fi  well no alarms seem to be going off  if thats what youre asking  are you almost done  just downloading files now  michaelget out  give me a sec  okay fi lets go  fi what are you doing lets go  uhoh  what uhoh  well you may have got out clean  but not everyone was so lucky  one of the problems with stealing information  is that its usually someone elses job  to keep that information safe  it doesnt matter how clean your getaway is  theres always a chance someone else will get blamed  for what you did  howd it go mike  you get what you were looking for  well its a start  did you find out anything about   about your fall guy  yeah i made some calls  turns out you were accessing the files  of a counterintelligence agent named jesse porter  hes in federal custody  are they prosecuting  doesnt seem like it  theyd have to declassify the files  theyre gonna blacklist the guy  mike you just burned a spy
