                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice on you youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  hey is that your mom again  if youre desperate  someone needs your help michael  bottom line  as long as youre burned  youre not going anywhere  previously on burn notice  we had one fight and you decide to go back to ireland  this isnt about one fight michael  its bad news mcbride  someones coming to kill my sister  thomas oneill bloodthirsty hooligan  you tell me where fiona is now  why dont you do yourself a favor and just forget the past  fiona is not my past  aah  fi  fi fi  aah  oneill outed you as an american  you can never go back to ireland  neither can she  what were you doing working with tom strickler  you know the kind of people he was in bed with  now someones in town cleaning up the mess he left behind   wait whos in town  i dont know  someones coming for me and theyre coming for you too  ow  hold still im almost done  youre doing this on purpose  im not the one who tore your stitches out  second week in a row  now stop moving or youre gonna do some serious damage  i will do some serious damage to you when this is over  i promise you that michael westen  you have the sewing skills of an orangutan  there now you can kill me if you want to  oh god i want to  okay yes you should rest  there you go  youre lucky that these sedatives are kicking in  cause i will kill you  ill be here  doing your own field medicine has its advantages   no conversations with the police  the foods better  and the relationship between patient and caregiver  is very close  ohh  oh  of course that last one can be a disadvantage as well  gotcha  so is she finally out  i was afraid the paint was gonna peel off the walls   shell be asleep for a while  you know its funny  when i thought she was leaving town  i actually felt a little bad  hard to believe i know  well it looks like shell be sticking around for a while  you find out anything  yeah i been calling around  the intelligence agencies are checking in to diegos death  apparently enough people saw you on the street  that youre not a suspect  for once theyre not blaming me for something  well it doesnt mean youre popular  operation unburn michael westen is officially off  i figured as much  yeah in the meantime  im checking out the phone that you lifted off of strickler  ive been trying to figure out  who threw diego off that hotel balcony  any luck  well its slow going  i mean the guy called for takeout food escort agencies  and of course he was calling all around the world  about your little burn notice  but best lead is this hotel on south beach  if were looking for someone in miami thats my bet  thanks sam  want me to go down there with you  i mean everything you say  this guy sounds like a grade a psychopath  ill be careful  take care of fi  of course  getting information out of hotels  requires a delicate touch  one whiff that youre snooping and youll just hear a lot of  we cant give out that information  you need to get them on your side  convince them that youre someone  that needs customer service  excuse me wondering if you could help me  a friend of mine was staying here at the hotel  and uh well we were supposed to hook up  mr westen weve been expecting you  of course when the hotel clerk turns out to be expecting you  that makes things a little easier  left it for me you sure  yes he had the bellman drop it off  he said youd be 61  exquisitely dressed with impeccable posture  in the world of espionage  there are a lot of ways to introduce yourself  you can use official channels you can use a cover id  you can use encrypted communication  whatever the method  that first contact tells you a lot about a person  especially when someone introduces himself  by firebombing a hotel room  he must been there to trigger the fire   did you see anything  not really  i dont know what he looks like  they never saw his face at the front desk  the room is registered to dr randolph quilling  quilling mike you serious  he was a british nuclear scientist killed in 99  burned to death in his hotel room  i think mikes new friend is telling us  that he was involved  its a hell of a thing  torching a hotel room as your business card  well as long as were waiting for our mystery man  to say hello again  i need you to take a meeting for me  its an insurancescam thing  i would do it  ohh  myself  but in my current state  you were going to leave the country  you were still taking jobs  well i had already committed to this   one last thing before going back to ireland  but someone got outed as an american spy  and now i cant go home  we saved your life remember  saved please  its out at the hallandale impound lot  thank you for meeting me  a friend of mine referred me to fiona  said she could take care of anything  yeah fionas good at what she does  thats my husbands car  he was killed last month in a fivecar pileup  i thought it was an accident but i found this  theyre insurance forms already filled out  some scam was gonna pay him to say that he hurt his neck  we had money problems and  he was just trying to save us  instead he got killed  some guy came to my house last week in a corvette  he said that since my husband died  i have to sue the city for wrongful death  and give them the money  he threatened my family  do you think that theres any way that fiona can help  ill see what she can do  shell be in touch when we know more  thank you  sam  hey mikey  i need you to go over to the county records office  see if you can get them to slip you some insurance records  mike you cant just ask for that stuff  use your sam magic  oh why didnt i think of that  the day that the cellphone call log was invented  should be celebrated as a national holiday for spies  even a cautious cellphone user who uses dialback systems  or switches phones often  leaves behind a lot of information you can use  you still going through that thing  strickler used this phone  chances are he talked to whoever it is  thats torching hotel rooms to say hello to me  have you considered turning this over to homeland security  they get paid for this sort of thing you know  for all i know he could be working for homeland security  ill call someone when i need someone  howd it go at the county records office sam  not good mike  i tried to get something  anything out of that lady down there about the insurance scam  shes 65 a widow  and completely immune to my charming ways  seriously you couldnt get the medical records  out of a 65yearold woman sam  shes my kryptonite okay  im telling you mike  you want to get the files out of that broad  its gonna take some extreme measures  i got an idea how to do it  but youre not gonna like it  you want me to lie to some woman in the county records office  what did she do  well no she didnt do anything  shes the only one that has access  to the information we need  why me  because shes your age smokes your brand and  shops at the same stores you do  sam did some scouting  we just thought that you would be someone she would trust  so that i can lie to her  its for a good cause mom  the people were trying to find  got some guys killed already  human intelligence can often be collected  with a cover identity  there are times though  when a cover id has more to do with who you are  than how you act  yes ive been through our records dozens of times  we lost a lot of that stuff in a hurricane a few years ago  and ive got files  that um are nothing but mildew  isnt that the worst i lost a couch that way  i swear sometimes i think we should all move to phoenix  hmm  if you could just give me all the names of the doctors  who treated my husband  ooh i wish i could  those files are all sealed though  doctorpatient confidentiality  oh  i just thought maybe  not even a quick glance  not even a peek  working an intelligence asset is part acting part strategy  some people dont have the talent  and some people do  thank you for your time   are you all right  yeah  sorry  it was   it was so much easier when my husband was alive  thank you  and he used to do all of this stuff for me  im sorry to have bothered you  uh  wait  let me see what i can dig up  this will be our secret though  of course  dont get me fired  oh no  no oh my goodness thank you so much  there he is  your moms got a gift for working assets  she brought back every document i asked for  well shes done her fair share of manipulating people  over the years  well she wasnt very happy about doing this  so our local county clinic is looking good  its got your normal folks  but theres a few too many shady characters  walking out of there with neck braces you know  oh check out the wheels  remembered you said that our bad guy drove a vette  so i called my buddy to run the plates  the guys name is ryan johnson  hes on parole for fraud and assault  so im guessing he didnt get that corvette and the iwc watch  from his workrelease job  looks like the guy calia said smacked her around  yeah oh got a cover id for you  youre from north carolina youre a friend of erik lees  whos erik lee  well hes one of ryans buddies  who was killed in the same crash as calias husband  stuff should check out if they dont check too deep  well looks like im going for a drive  have fun mikey  precision driving is part of the standard training for an operative  its mainly used when pursuing or being pursued  but on occasion its a great way to make an impression  whoo hey boy  yeah you and me  you and me need to talk  jesus are you crazy  hey im alex you must be ryan johnson right  what the hell is this  hell whats it look like boy its a job application  criminals deal with a shortage of skilled labours  just like all businesses do  they cant give too much information  to new hires of course  but they also cant pass up real talent  i was driving for an insurance crew up in north carolina  i was working with your boy erik lee up there  eriks not with us anymore  yeah i know got himself killed  squashed by a truck a few weeks back  yeah something like that  word on the street is youre the numberone crew around town  and sounds like you got a job openin   well you can drive ill give you that  you give me that  hell ill take it im the best wheelman around  you got someone working for you you think is better  you point him out and ill prove you wrong  theres a bar down at the river on fifth street  meet me there tomorrow at noon  they sent some more guys by the house  sat there glaring at me while i filled out some paperwork  youre doing the right thing  just stay cool do as they ask and well take care of it  but cant you just talk to them or   its not gonna do much good at this point  they may back off for a while  but theyll come right back  and do it again to someone else  an insurance scam is like a network   doctors lawyers autorepair places enforcers  if you dont want people coming after you  you have to take down the whole thing   pull the weed out by the roots  well get these guys going on a scam call the cops  and get them caught in the act  ill keep you and your boys safe  thank you  youve been so amazing  and the people that you have working for you  theyre just great  its so important to find good help  mike ive been working on our little manhunt  i wish i had more to go on  than a nameless faceless murderer  with a taste for arson but anyway  feds got nothing they ruled diego a suicide  and you you done any better  well a little  ive been triangulating one of the phones  that strickler was calling trying to get a location  how long before we got something  couple of days but you know  no matter who this guy is mike we know two things   hes a killer and he saw you coming before so i   i dont have a lot of options here  someone killed my cia contact now that is on my head  i dont get to walk away or pretend it didnt happen  no matter how dangerous this game hes playing is  you know that and youd do the same thing  i get it i dont like it but i get it  let me know when you got something solid  you got it  oh mike uh one more thing  i think your mom is a little unclear  about the proper handling of intelligence assets  you might want to talk to her  you want another gin and tonic tina  oh no no thanks im fine  hi honey  tina this is my son michael  y  your handsome son  its very nice to meet you  mom could i talk with you for a second  sure would you excuse me tina  sure you dont want another  mom what are you doing  what does it look like im doing  im playing canasta with a friend  a friend no shes a   she did me a favor  why cant we be friends  thats not how it works  you told her your name my name  you dont socialize with an asset  shes not an asset  shes a person sitting at my diningroom table  i know that  mom its dangerous she broke the law  you said that that job was over  just dont get too close  what are you worried about  so your mom becomes friends with the county records lady  so what  you just never know how things are gonna go  shes an asset things could get very complicated  i was an asset of yours once  and things got complicated  and people got hurt  true  but in my experience  people get hurt and things get complicated  no matter what you do  dad this is the guy i was telling you about  you said you wanted drivers  well this guy can drive  he drove with erik lee up in north carolina  i checked him out and hes the real deal  so youre the big bad boss  boss no just a businessman  sounds good cause im looking to do some business  im looking for a crew you know what im saying  i did some driving up north  amateurs  they didnt know real talent  talent huh  what ryan said it sounded more like recklessness  well talent recklessness  its a fine line aint it  you got any warrants you do you dont drive   im clean  accidents hows your driving record  i got plenty of accidents but none on my record  all right heres the deal  we use a couple dozen drivers a year  rotate them in and out  make sure nobody shows up in the system too much  you make sure ryan has your information  and well call you  so next time ill need you to bring me your drivers license  ill need local and out of state  whoa there my friend  maybe i wasnt making myself clear  im not looking to make a few hundred bucks  driving third wheel in a bumpandrun  im here looking for some business  with a team management  get your hand off me  im just hoping youre not wasting my time is all  management huh  ill tell you what  theres an autobody shop in boca owes us 10 grand  and my boy here hasnt been able to collect  dad i told you that i can handle that  shut up youre the one that brought this guy in here  you two go up there together  you get our money back you got a job  now that sounds like a deal  family businesses are tough  and theyre even tougher for criminals  mix normal family issues with cash  violence and the danger of getting arrested  and things get tense  oh come on kid dont be like that  thisll work out good youll see  whatever  its not like you cant use the help  from what i saw in the papers  you could use someone like me  i mean a crash like that   you know what we do just fine  all right we do more than fine  the wife of one of the dead guys  shes suing  were looking to get a million out of the city maybe more   shes willing to go to court for you  she will  or  her little kid will fall down the stairs at school  whoohoo  you boys know how to kick some ass dont you  tell me more about this little collection  its a bunch of bikers all right this is stupid  ive already  ive already talked to these guys twice already  well third times a charm  i told you were not kicking back 10 grand  tony you wouldnt have made any of that  if we hadnt rigged the bids  we already did the work thats the way its   girls girls girls dont fight youre both pretty  tell you what  you wont give him the money you can give me the money  youre not getting that money  oh yall are gonna give me the money right now  alex what are you doing what the hells it look like im doing  im getting you your 10 grand  anybody who works around acetylene  knows to be extra careful  its one of the hottestburning  most explosive gases in existence  they aint gonna shoot  not while were near these tanks  because if they do  therell be little pieces of biker raining all around here   hey stop  you can make this stop anytime  if you put 10 grand into a bag  throw your guns in it while youre at it  anytime now  do what he says get the money  dad we got it  yeah all 10 grand  look you got a job  well thats good news youre making my day  oh we should celebrate somewhere else  damn  looks like i gotta have a meeting with the boss later  im gonna bring him some ideas  calia and son are at my place  ill go give them the good news  you are doing so well on this job  i think were almost even  almost  whats wrong sam  ive never seen you drink a beer that slowly  i just think wed be better off  if we focused on this insurancescammer thing  and forgot the whole diego getting murdered business  cause its not looking pretty  well what is it  well i did the triangulation on that phone   you know the one that our hotelroomtorching mystery man  was using  and i found it  well  the thing is the phone is down at the old marine stadium  marine stadium isnt it closed  yeah for like 20 years its just a graffiti magnet  and the phone is just sitting there  its such a setup mike its not even a setup you know  so what are you gonna do  im gonna go down there im gonna check it out  of course you are  for a covert operative  theres often a fine line between hunter and hunted  letting someone hunt you is just another way  of finding out more about them  cellphone signals coming from out here  of course theres also a fine line  between following up intelligence  and walking into a trap  doesnt get more exposed than this does it  you sure you want to do this  yeah im sure stay here cover me as best as you can  hello  sorry we missed each other at the hotel  me too  ive heard so much about you  its an honor to see you in the flesh  youre quite a puzzle mr westen  fascinating  im far more interesting in person  who are you  oh i cant just tell you now can i  wheres the fun in that  im trying to figure out what kind of man you are  i need to decide if youre someone  i should get to know better  or someone i should kill  well let me know when you make up your mind  oh youll know  mike get out of there  you okay brother  im fine sam  so how did the big meeting go  we had a brief and unsatisfying chat on the phone  so who is he  i dont know but he shot up the marine stadium  reminded me of a stadium shooting  back in 98 in south america  sams looking into it seeing if theres a connection  i started on a listening device  for your meeting with ryan later  would you care to join me  i would love to  you know  after the other day  i i never really did get a  a chance to actually say  well not that i have any doubt in my mind  that i would have saved myself eventually  and i still think that your tactical approach  was a little iffy  but you and sam  you did come back for me  you gave up a lot to come back for me  whether i needed it or not  youre welcome fi  watch it youre getting solder on my transmitter  so 10 grand  ryan here is still a little fuzzy on the details  of how you two got it  but  me and ryan here are like bonnie and clyde  youd have been proud  im sure i would have  we got the money all right  you want to talk about management opportunities  talk  scams called deathwish  i ran it a couple times back when i was just starting out  im gonna need a stooge  someone who can take some damage but for a serious payday  yeah i know a few people  the stooge sets up at a railroad crossing  gets a city vehicle behind them  we come in as a threeman team  two drivers box the city vehicle in  third driver he knocks the city vehicle  into the stooges car stooge goes into the railroad  train hits the car right  thats right  one of those big engines clips it  bashes it up real good spins it around  newspapers take photos  and we cash in  you go after the deep pockets   the train company the city government the state  clear 100 grand without even breaking a sweat  someone gets killed you could add a couple of zeros to that  yeah youre a big thinker thats why hes the boss right  but a train though  dad weve never done anything   shut up listen for once  maybe youll learn something  you come back in a couple days  ill put a few guys together  well see if we can do this  im sorry  would you mind popping this into my car  im just so hot  and i really dont want to leave it behind  no problem  thank you  the best place for a bug  is on something people keep with them  many car remotes these days  have enough space inside to hide a small bug  not to mention a battery to power the transmitter  sam can you hear me  its a quick efficient lowrisk operation  that costs as much as you care to tip the valet  thank you  you got some serious balls you know that  im just trying to make us some money thats all  yeah  why dont you just slow down a little  youve been with us for a couple days now  and you already act like you run things  whatever problem you got with your pop dont concern me  i dont have any problems with my dad all right  its none of your business  all right all right im just trying to help  you done fiddling with your car  uh just fixing a taillight  im so glad your fathers tools are still getting some use  it always makes me sad  to think of them sitting there getting dusty  what happened to the charger  you know just wear and tear  whatever  ill see you later im off to the beach with tina  tina mom we talked about this  we talked about the fact that shes my friend  oh forget it  im not gonna wear my bathing suit after all  its too horrifying  oh hello  youre lucky to have a son whos over here so much  yes well he was gone for a couple of decades  hes still making up for lost time  lets go  yeah sam  bad news mike  uh ive been monitoring your buddy ryans bug  and  well it sounds like he decided to jump the gun  and pull your deathwish scam himself   what when  right now it sounds like  hes paying some poor old guy to get knocked  in front of the 535 commuter train  sam the  yeah i know  theyre headed toward the fifth street crossing right now  i mean look i could call the cops   by the time they figure out what the hell is going on  we cant risk it we got to get over there now  all right ill get myself a new set of wheels  when you work under a cover  whether youre a cop a dea agent or a spy  youre getting into business with the bad guys  your job is to stay in control of that business  the problem is criminals are unpredictable  sometimes they take your ideas and resources  and hurt innocent people  its every undercover agents worst nightmare  which is why you do whatever it takes  to make sure that doesnt happen  boxing in a large vehicle and forcing it into a crash  takes a coordinated group effort  its a little like flying planes in formation  if one of the planes is trying to get away   very difficult and very very dangerous  the good news is that when a plan  requires clockwork timing and precise movements  it doesnt take much to ruin that precision  do it right and you can avoid sending anybody to the morgue  you may bruise a few egos though  what the hell happened  ryan jumped the gun on the train scam  we had to stop him before he got someone killed  and  well nobody was hurt  but our cover was blown  and now ryan knows that his new recruit  is not who he imagined him to be  great  and now weve got nothing  i was just telling calia  shed be able to go home for her sons birthday  yeah well ive been listening in on ryans conversations  and daddy has put a halt to everything  i mean theyre not making any new moves  which unfortunately means  theyre gonna focus on all the irons  they already have in the fire  like my client  sam what would the cops need  to build a case against these guys   you mean if they didnt catch them redhanded  mmhmm  well the only thing we have  are the medical and insurance records for calias husband  if were gonna nail these guys  we need the records on everybody  that those doctors have treated  and if were gonna save calia thats what we need  mike are you thinking what i think youre thinking  good luck with that brother  you cant be serious  mom i wish there was some other way  shes my friend michael  youre asking me to go back to my friend  a woman i tried on bathing suits with for gods sake  and  and  and blackmail her into giving me documents  i told you there was a reason not to get too close  why so i wouldnt feel bad when i destroy a life  ma these are bad guys  theyre using desperate people  dont you talk to me about using people  youre asking me to force tina  to sneak into the records office  shes gonna lose her job  and if she doesnt people will lose their lives  its one job  i know its not easy but if you do the math mom   thats what this is then  the math  sometimes yeah  is this what you do michael  you destroy good people  my job is to help people  and that can mean doing things  that i wish i didnt have to do  and sometimes theres no other way  now you lived in the same house i did  you made hard choices  so you know this as well as i do  when youre blackmailing someone  you have to be cruel to be kind  show any sympathy for your target  and you only make it worse  you have to be the bad guy  let them feel they have no choice  its easier that way  maddy  easier for them anyway  how sweet of you to come by  do you like my new haircut  of course  uh tina i wondered if we could talk  sure come on back  what are you saying  i dont expect you to understand  but tina youve already given me something you shouldnt  something you could get in a lot of trouble for  that information is confidential  i cant get that many files that fast  without anyone knowing  i dont want to hurt you but i need the documents  you dont want to hurt me y  you are blackmailing me  you acted like you were my friend and  what kind of a person   listen to me tina  this will go a lot easier for you  if you just do what im asking  so theyll find the documents missing  you can say you  you misfiled them  you  you forgot about them  i dont care what you say  you know im going to lose my job  and you dont care  you play ball and dont cause any problems  you can get another job  there its everything you asked for  well  well mom where are you going dont you want a ride  ill take the bus  mike how we doing  good to go sam  theres a city vehicle on holliston ave  driver parked it headed off to lunch  its just sitting there waiting for a crash   you ready to do some driving  oh yeah  oh by the way the documents your ma picked up are perfect  put this stuff in the right place at the right time  whole thing comes crumbling down  fi ryans coming out of the bar  are you good to go  never been better this should be fun  yeah just stay focused  my mother may never speak to me again after this job  so i want to make sure it was worth it  all right and  go  a push bar is a hardened steel frame  attached to the front of a car  its usually used by cops  but its useful for anyone  whos planning on being in a highspeed collision  oops  yeah baby  hello police im over on holliston avenue  there was a crash  theres a guy with a goatee and welldressed  well i think he crashed into a city truck on purpose  he was waving a gun around in traffic  hell boy anyone ever teach you how to park  you son of a bitch  me son of a bitch  youre the one who tried to steal my scam  and take it to daddy but it didnt help did it  daddy knows you cant take it doesnt he  theres a tunnel vision that people develop in a fight  they focus on their enemy oblivious to everything else  the angrier they get the more intense their focus  there comes a point where the adrenaline is so intense  you could land a jet behind them and they wouldnt notice   nice one nice one  iall done  you know wt  im gonna go somewhere where im appreciated  get down on the ground get down on the ground  get your hands behind your head  thank you so much  i  i still cant believe you were able to take care of this  oh thats the reason people call me  and him  are you sure its safe  are they really gone  the cops had a pretty good basis for an investigation  once things got going ryan turned on his father  they went after each other  and practically handed the case to the city  theyll be leaving you alone now  i have to pick up ben from school but  thank you thank you so much  i spoke to your mom earlier  yeah  shes still pretty upset  it was the right thing to do but that poor woman tina  shegonna lose everything  michael  ill see what i can do  good morning mom  look whos here  i didnt sleep at all last night  i kept seeing tinas face  her mascara all smeared from crying  calling me a monster  made me wonder how youve ever been able to sleep at all  the last two decades  sometimes its hard  thats not enough michael  mom i came to   who said that you get to decide whats right and whats wrong  and who gets sacrificed for the greater good  and who doesnt  do you think i like it  what can i do people come to me  oh dont give me that michael  you dont have to go running around blowing things up  every time a problem comes your way  you were offered a job and you dragged me into it  you think i do this for the money  yes  i dont know i dont  people need me  so i have to  yes i guess you do  im just tired  what are you doing here at 6 00 in the morning  where you been  county record building  there was a breakin  someone went through all the files  theyll discover it monday  your friend tina shell be fine  nobody will ever be able to tell that she took any files  someone broke in  suns come up  you want a cup of coffee  whats wrong sam  well ive been doing some research  trying to connect the dots to find our killer you know  so there was the hotel thing right  then i followed up your hunch  about that stadium shooting in south america  six police officials shot in a soccer stadium  six shots at the marine stadium  no one claimed credit for either incident though  right thing is you were off in bosnia  when they did the followup  and both times there was a lot of talk  about the same guy  mason gilroy  ive heard the name   are you sure  yep  there was some cologne on that note you got at the hotel  stuff is called monaco silver  last sighting of gilroy  monaco  what a coincidence  so i came here to tell you  and i found this by the gate  he knows where you live mike  and he didnt kill me yet  gilroy  you figured out my name  good for you i knew you were a clever boy  are we done playing  that is the question isnt it  i noticed you didnt sound the alarm with the authorities  which i think is a promising sign  i think perhaps we should meet  just give me a time and a place
