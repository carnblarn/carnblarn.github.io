                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them   an old friend whos informing on you to the fbi  you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls   family too  is that your mom again   if youre desperate someone needs your help  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere   for anyone who works in covert ops  names have a special power  knowing someones real name who they work for  youve got something on them  out a spy in the field and you can get him killed  out a bureaucrat in a restaurant  jason jason bly   and youll just piss him off  good to see you  i figured youd find me sooner or later  everyone  everyone this is officer jason bly of the css  it is a branch of the nsa  performing covert intelligence support for the military  all right thats enough you think so  i was gonna go into the history of the service  give people some background  not a bad picture i take terrible photo ids  one of the reasons why  i never worked for any service branch directly  i suppose you think that youre gonna be able  to leverage stealing my agency id card  into a ticket off the blacklist  no i just wanted to get to know you better  well ive been getting to know you and your friends  sam axe fiona glenanne your mother  oh bly i thought i told you6  this is just between you and me  see i dont think so  adjusting to your circumstances is a process  its natural for there to be some grieving some anger  some denial  involving your friends and familys  an important part of adjusting  for example your girlfriend fiona  shes not my girlfriend  yeah yeah i know on again off again  that is a complicated relationship  ive been listening to the surveillance tapes  you know i think  well i think both of you have issues  one mans opinion thats true  she is coming here to meet you isnt she  if my informations correct she should be here shortly  oh hey there she is  mike she is a really finelooking girl  she does take risks though doesnt she  that car was stolen three weeks ago  have you looked inside the trunk  seems that shes been doing some gun dealing  yeah she can take care of herself  no you should talk to her  you should talk to her because if she gets caught  you may never be able to resolve  those thorny relationship issues  oh you should get going  hey ill get the check  go go  michael what bly set you up  do you have guns in the trunk  fi  a few semiautomatics yeah  i got a deal michael  this guy was selling browning 9 millimeters  for 200 bucks apiece  you have unregistered weapons in a stolen car fi  you know  you have always had a problem with my work  i have always supported you  im helping people youre running guns  big difference  is the car at least clean  good  the longer you run from the police  the more certain you are to get caught  theres a small window of time after a chase begins  before backup arrives  before helicopters are deployed  if you want any chance of getting away  youd best use this time to find someplace secluded  here here   and bail out  see you back at the loft  oh here he is now ill talk to you later  your mom says hi  how did you get here so fast  oh i got a ride  from a pleasant retired gentleman named hubert  he was concerned for my safety  let me get this straight  i was set up by bly  revenge for stealing his wallet  he wasnt gonna send you to jail  too much paperwork he knew id save you  save me i dont need saving  the point is it was a message for me  to shut up and accept that ive been burned for good  or my friends and family are fair game  i see  just curious which am i  can we discuss this later  so once bly gets taken care of  we can discuss our relationship  sure  i dont suppose killing him would expedite that  no fi no hes the best connection i have  he can tell me why i was burned who did this to me  i need to get some leverage  if i got to go to war with bly  i got to put some cash together  these guys come down and make me give them money   every couple of days  at first they said it was for protection  now they dont even bother to lie  they work for this bruja concha ramirez  shes got guys all around here  a woman boss how progressive  listen pretty soon i cant be in business no more  i talked to my friend javier  you helped him with that cabrn  that came after his kid  and asked him not to talk about it yeah  what exactly are you looking for  i got 20 grand  i want them out of the neighborhood  no i want them gone  these guys work for this woman concha  it sounds like an organization  javier said you could handle it  aw im flattered but  theyre ruining the neighborhood okay  people who lived on this block their whole lives  are losing everything  my pops built this place  i aint giving up without a fight  have you tried talking to the police  they come give me paperwork and go back to coral gables  i try to get the neighborhood to fight but theyre scared  we got families  i need your help  the rest after  ill see what i can do  dont ill see what i can do do it  youre the last chance we got  okay  yeah sam  hey mike we got a situation here  your buddy bly talked to my girlfriend and shes pissed  hi honey  she hit me with one of those meat tenderizers  sam get in here  okay honey just a minute  do you want an extraction team  ill let you know what about bly  the son of a bitch is doing scorchedearth number here  im taking care of it  see if you can get out in one piece  yeah  sweetie hey easy now come on  a cia agent came into my home  look it wasnt cia it was css  its a branch of the national security agency  he told me you were seeing that whore in bal harbour  i was just going to get my clothes  its over pumpkin  oh  mike this is some serious collateral damage  i mean i like this girl we got to do something  i know i know  i think this will be enough cash to take care of bly  maybe even find out why i was burned  what are you gonna throw money at him  something like that ill work out the details  you know anything about this gang  they work for a cuban migr named concha ramirez  she works out of a restaurant on miami beach  i dont know organized crime is a pain in the ass  theres a reason i didnt become a fed  we just need them to decide  the neighborhoods not worth the trouble and move on  scare the hell out of them  sounds like fun  lets do the recon check out her soldiers  take a look at concha and see what were dealing with  here you go sam  buy your girlfriend some flowers  oh mike its gonna take more than flowers  i mean shes pretty pissed  this bly was rude i mean really rude  shes feeling a little better now  okay perfect thanks  ill get the check  when you gonna get a real car  this things like a toy  veronica was gonna get me a cadillac  until mikes surveillance guy screwed everything up  a cadillac  what could you possibly be doing to these women  wouldnt you like to know  there she is  wow not bad for a crime boss  dice que no puede pagar que tiene un chiquito enfermo  coman no puede pagar porqu t me traes esto  mira si l no puede pagar dle pregntale a la esposa  si tienes el seguro de la vida  porqu t mira yo te di sto usalo  porqu t me traes stoi  vaya  get in there  in intelligence work  surveillance is called coverage  its like basketball  you can run zone defense or mantoman  mantomans risky  follow someone too long  theyre going to get suspicious  zone is usually the way to go  stay put and let targets come to you  less obvious easier on the feet   and you can catch up on your celebrity gossip  charo  mira que yo tengo para t  no saque es aqu  no habla entrale entra  theyre leaning hard on the neighborhood  bad business driving away people who are paying you off  so theyre amateurs  thatll make it easier to get rid of them  im not sure it was a good idea to give sam the caf  three cuban coffees in  his camerawork gets kind of jittery  its not the coffee  he has ladyfriend problems  you know i have to say  sams romantic side is surprising  not now fi im talking about sam  and youre going to use sam as a way to talk about us  after  all right  all right  but i promise you if im not satisfied  then i am gonna kick your ass  explaining the rules of covert ops  is always a challenge  its a world where good guys look like bad guys  and two wrongs do in fact make a right  i got to bust up your counter  you want to smash up my counter  and a few other things its part of the plan ernie  no i already got enough people  who want to smash up my place  i dont need anymore  the only way this ends is if these guys think  theyre up against somebody worse than they are  i thought you were supposed to protect the neighborhood  if i act like a security guard  theyre just gonna send more guys  my friend said you could fight  he said you were you know special forces  bullets dont bounce off my skin ernie  im gonna solve this but i got to do it my way  and ernie ernie look i need your help  what do you want me to do  i need you to spread the word  that some serious psycho robbed your place  and please please  keep your mouth shut about hiring me  or youll get us both killed you understand  theres no turning back ernie after i do this  if you want to walk

white phosphorus or chlorine trifluoride  these are remarkably effective  but theyre also unstable lethally toxic  and hard to find at the grocery store  the main ingredient in a homemade firebomb  on

idea of people doing bad things for good reasons  doing good things for bad reasons  you do the best you can  you can go back to your store  theyre never gonna come to your neighborhood again  you can count it its all there  thats all right  actually here  thats most of it back less some expenses  i just needed a wad of cash  to run through some bank accounts  its complicated  i wasnt gonna take
