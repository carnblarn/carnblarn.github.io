                my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until  we got a burn notice youre blacklisted  when youre burned youve got nothing  no cash no credit no job history  youre stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in  where am i miami  you do whatever work comes your way  you rely on anyone whos still talking to you  a triggerhappy exgirlfriend  should we shoot them  an old friend whos informing on you to the fbi  you know spies  a bunch of bitchy little girls  family too  is that your mom again  if youre desperate someone needs your help  bottom line until you figure out who burned you  youre not going anywhere  for most people a night out at the miami clubs  is a chance to see and be seen  when youre under government surveillance  its a different story  you still want to know whos watching you  but the reasons are a little different  looks like youve had visitors  took them long enough  sprinkle a mixture of flour and dayglo powder on your floor  before you go out  and youll know whether youve had any visitors  and what they were after  a threeman team  sounds about right two sneakers and a loafer  theyre not terribly careful your surveillance  you dont always have to get that clever though  sometimes they want you to know what theyre up to  they werent hiding  i miss your fbi detail they were really kind of sweet  the feds were errand boys  but these guys on the other hand  might actually know something useful  honestly i dont know why they bother  they should just put a bullet in your head and be done with it  apparently im more valuable alive than dead  but im sure theyll take it under advisement  you think theyre listening  yeah mom  michael there are men here outside the house with guns  what what men  i dont know theyve been watching  theyre coming inside call the cops call them right now  take the van and cover the street  not a problem  stop right there  its okay its okay  mom  mom  aw i figured you for 12  its probably those causeways though  youll have to forgive my sketchy miami geography  im new in town  we nearly got lost coming from your place  mom you okay  they cut the phone lines i couldnt call the police  they broke in  its okay its okay  you want to tell me who you are  im the new man in your life  its okay  you pissed off a lot of people  getting your hands on the homelandsecurity directive  authorizing your burn notice  youre a private citizen now  youre not supposed to touch that kind of thing  i asked nicely  you wanted attention from someone  a little higher up on the food chain  thats about right  its your lucky day here i am  and here i will stay  until you back off  michael why are they doing this  are you in some kind of trouble  not now not now mom  your problem is with me not with her  you have no business coming here  oh no but we do  see youre a major security risk  you just assaulted two federal agents  go ahead arrest me  id like to take a look at the indictment  wouldnt you now yeah  listen you be a good boy and ill get out of your hair  until then ill need to keep looking  god  sorry you cant be too careful  there are two kinds of government surveillance  the kind thats there to look for something  and the kind thats just there to make your life difficult   mike you get problems like that call me  i still got pull in that department  maybe i can get them to go home  i dont want them to go home i need this guy in town  i need to know who he is and what he knows  i can help you with that then  i tried i got your voice mail  yeah sorry about that

like charmers  you tell me what are your fbi friends telling you  nothing  theyd be pissed if they found out  somebody pulled rank on them  these intelligence outfits theyre springing up  faster than frickin starbucks these days  let me know if you hear anything  mmm where are you going  i got to scrounge up a job  my moms house needs remodeling  i might have to call lucy  what about my seal buddy  that thing i was telling you about  is that a job or a favor  no its a job its real money  hes a great guy mike he saved my ass several times  hes a boatrepo guy  its a tough job he just needs some muscle  muscle great  hmm  there she is  there you go sammy thank you doll  plant one right there  you sure i cant get you anything  no thank you  i have outoftown guests i need to attend to  you have fun  mike call me now  you can tie up a lot of resources  by keeping a bugged phone line open  as long as its open  theyre supposed to keep listening  you have reached the consulate of the commonwealth of belize  leave your message after the tone  dd72478  say a few cryptic things now and then  and theyll be stuck in their little van  trying to figure out what the hell youre doing   they cant go home cant grab a bite to eat  cant take a leak  and a limited number of viewers  who are also gonna be lucky enough to buy  and the longer theyre stuck in a van with a set of headphones  the more you can find out about them  just look at that round cut brilliant  appreciate you coming mike  sams told me a good deal about you  really  come on mike dont be like that  virg is one of us  seal teams panama iraq china  last time i checked i had topsecret clearance  but i havent checked in a while  sam tells me youre some kind of spy  or used to be  yall want a beer  yeah ill take one  i knew youd want one sam what about you mike  it might be hot in that jacket  no im good whats the job  pain in my ass  i was supposed to repo a donzi 27 zr  for a guy whos done me a few favors  but i went to pick the thing up  and a couple of jamaicans tuned me up but good  damn embarrassing  oh come on they had 30 years on you and a baseball bat  well i am on blood thinners  goddamn pills make me lightheaded  oh hell thats no excuse anyway now im in a bind  word gets out i cant hack it ffft im done  im not one to ask for help but there it is  thats a fast boat  smuggling  its a highperformance speedboat  in a crappy little hellhole of a marina  what the hell else is it gonna be  maybe cuban cigars maybe grass  problem is these guys have guns  and they like to wave them around  listen just pick the thing up  point a to point b ffft  oh is that all point a to point b  well when you put it that way  all right look id go down there with you guys  but these guys know me  cash on delivery  my buddy mason is gonna be waiting for it  at a repair warehouse up on 23rd  mike we get fi involved we got a threeman team  do it just like that personnel carrier in bulgaria  i mean look i got to get my new lady friend something nice  and you sure as hell need the cash  free gator steaks in it for you  best in the everglades  ill think about it  youre towing my car  hey yeah there might be evidence in here  evidence  theres a busted 8track and one of my moms lamps  im trying to piece back together  well i guess well find out wont we  oh by the way we noticed suspicious activity  on your phone line so we took care of it for you  oh thanks  alas you wont have phone service for a while  hey you want a stick of gum  yeah thanks i didnt catch your name  no you didnt  yeah sam about that job im in  oh oh and tell virgil i need to borrow his truck  mmm hes cute  were gonna take his boat  i doubt hes gonna give you his phone number  who knows ive had stranger dates  so whats your cover id mikey  i think im gonna go with  devoted employee  howshomer  homer i like it  as a rule spies dont like dealing with cops  covert ops are illegal by definition  if they were legal they wouldnt need to be covert  want me to set up that one mike  the sailboat  yeah thats good  still the police can be useful  if you need a little insurance against people shooting  yeah hi  um boy i dont know if this is the sort of thing  i should be calling the police about but  oh im at the marina down on waverly street  yeah i saw some men  loading bags full of white powder into a sailboat  kind of creeped me out you know  hey there  can i help you  yes sir im here for that boat  oh youre with the repo man huh  my boss hell of a guy  hes like a father to me you beat him up pretty good  yeah that was unfortunate  i tried to explain the situation to him you know  but he forced me to clarify my position  this is my property  weve got paperwork that says otherwise  hmm well that paperwork is misinformed  hmm why dont we ask the police to sort this out  i mean theyre right over there  i could holler over to them right now  and ask them to come sort this out  thats a nice piece you gonna shoot me with it  probably gonna have to shoot her too  it might be tough to explain to the cops  or i could just start screaming  the way i see it if this is your boat  these guns are registered and youre 100 squeaky clean  you have nothing to worry about  but if not  all right  youre making a serious mistake man  you do this  theres no turning back you know  i cant leave without the boat  so if youre gonna shoot us get it done  otherwise we got places to be  you know well deal with this another time  when i got a little bit more privacy  ooh leather seats  i can see why youre so attached to it  pretty lady dont get too comfortable  ill see you soon huh  i promise  easy now  whoa  what you looking for back there  he was confident he was getting his boat back  i want to make sure theres no surprises  well people get attached to their vehicles  i had a cadillac eldorado once  that thing was part of the family  gps tracker  thats how our jamaican friend was gonna find us  son of a bitch  sam how well do you know virgil  you trust him  hes like a brother mike  i mean the guy saved my life  when youre going into a meeting cold  with people you know nothing about  you have to be extra careful  pay attention to every detail  map out an escape route or two just in case  and never ever show up as yourself  you mason  yeah who the hell are you  you waiting on a boat delivery  yeah wheres virgil  oh he cant make it he sent me instead  im one of virgils drivers my names homer  hold on homer not coming  what do you mean hes supposed to be here  you know how he is  well i got your boat outside with my team  team  you got other guys outside  another thing you look for  is people who seem overly upset that things have changed  details that shouldnt matter so much  damn wow that is a twin supercharged sterling  whoowee i got a 400 horsepower back at home  i work on it a little bit  some tipoffs arent so subtle  like a detonator sitting on enough chloride  to incinerate a city block  why dont we move this along what do you say  all right let me go get your boat  well were all gonna go get the boat  no need to get gun happy  calm down  put it out  its clear  i dont think they followed you  it got pretty hairy back there  how well do you know these clients of yours  you mean mason  like i said he did me a few favors  he had all the paperwork  it seemed like a simple delivery  mason and his friends are cops dirty cops  what are you talking about  oh i wouldnt lie to me again virgil  they had departmentissue glocks on hip holsters  a latemodel crown vic in the parking lot  in fact i think they knew you  you know what it sounded like to me  they do know me  from some boat repos that went bad  they came to me i got a daughter in tampa  they took pictures  they said theyd hurt her if i didnt help  why do they want that boat so bad  how the hell do i know its a donzi 27 zr  they were ready to incinerate it and you  i mean its a nice boat but its not worth  killing the four of us and blowing up a boatyard  sam you know i wouldnt do this to you  i may be a son of a bitch for dragging you into this  but if i had any other choice come on  please please  hey mike  you know how i told you virgil saved my life and all that  the truth is its its more complicated  back in 84 i was in east germany  i made some mistakes mike  did some stuff i shouldnt have  virgil gave me a second chance  when i sure as hell didnt deserve it  i owe him mike  sam its his daughter  look if youre not in on this i got to handle it myself  you cant handle this by yourself sam  yeah i know  we need a place to stash him  and my third tour i was laid up for six months  with infected feet and some kind of agent orange disease  oh thats horrible  hurt all over kind of achy  they thought i was after disability  i know tone  they dont bel  exactly  so when i got back i got into boat repo  and that was fine for a while  till of course my wife passed away  and then things went downhill  i think we can skip the life story  virgils only going to be here a night maybe two  wheres the hatchet mom  try the utility drawer  i dont want to be an imposition  i can sleep out in the back if you need  oh no i dont mind really  id never see michael at all  if he didnt bring his friends over  i know what thats like  i dont get to see my daughter trudy very much either  oh yeah  if was worse after he went overseas  and michaels father died in 98  how did you lose your wife  cancer she was a nurse at the va  of course thats how we met  find anything  no tore the seats out  im working on the carpeting nothing yet  check under the subfloor  mike i got a hatchet and a vise grip  okay ill work something out  call me if you find anything  my surveillance has had a good 14 hours  to get into my place again  i got to get back there  say hi for me  you can turn an old tv into an oscilloscope  with about 150 worth of hardware  itll electrocute you if youre not careful  but it makes a decent bug detector  if you dont want to tip off anyone who might be listening  you have to be prepared to keep talking for a few hours  oh another no confidence vote in the italian parliament  any thoughts  as interested as i am in european politics  i was thinking this would be a good opportunity  for us to discuss why exactly you left me  of course when you have to keep talking  its an opportunity for someone to hijack the conversation  for their own purposes  oh i think now is the perfect time  it was a difficult time  there was an important reason it was years ago  we should let me gather my thoughts  and we can talk about this another time  not even a goodbye michael  if you remember i made you dinner that night  well had i known it was the last supper  i would have chewed slower  if you recall my cover was blown  you could have left a note  leaving notes is bad tradecraft  it could have put you in danger  you ran away in the middle of the night for my benefit  believe it or not fi yeah it was for your benefit  and yours  yes fi and mine  thanks michael  a little honesty is  refreshing  let us take some pictures to celebrate this special night  what a great idea  the optical bug is a hightech toy  that shoots a light beam in a window  it picks up vibrations from the glass  and translates it into speech  hows that one can i see it  yeah  you cant see the beam with the naked eye  but take the infrared filter off a digital camera  and it shows up nicely  as hightech as a laser mike is theyre not hard to defeat  they pick up vibrations on the glass  so you supply your own vibrations  you had to do that now  i didnt say id help you for free  you found the eavesdropper  ill go over to his little listening post  wait till he leaves see where he scurries to  you think hes the one who burned you  no but he came here to show me whos boss  hes one step closer  we should do this more often  yeah sam  mikey ive been calling all night  yeah it wasnt safe to talk earlier  whats up  you better get over here now  mom wheres virgil we need to talk  hes still asleep  have you been up all night  yeah virgil  where is he  hes in my bedroom  ugh  hes lonely michael  and so am i  its been a long time since your father died  and sometimes i think it would be good  for us to have more of a family  oh with virgil  he lives in a beatup trailer  half of his meals come from roadkill  stop being so judgmental michael  all right your father had problems too  wake him up  have him meet me out in the backyard  its important  i ripped her open and there it was  im guessing about 10 million give or take  but nobody ever thinks of packing it  in something with a goddamn handle  is this money real  oh yeah  its probably headed toward aruba or anguilla  one of those caribbean money holes  to want us dead  come on mike  thats a glasshalfempty way of looking at it  mason probably stumbled upon the moneysmuggling operation  didnt want to risk pulling the heist himself  you were the cutout  you deliver the boat he shoots you  and 300 gallons of burning methyl chloride  cleans up the mess  jesus  what do i do  well for now  dump the boat  you have any way of reaching these cops  i got a number  naw this aint virgil  this is your buddy homer remember me  no he aint around yall have to deal with me now  and i want a meeting  when working a cover identity  the safest thing is to let the target take the lead  youve got more information than he does  you want to keep that edge  hey you brought your friends  we got a little party going on here dont we  you want some fries  how would you like to die choking on them  oh theyre good  not that good but theyre good  now see that is just unfriendly  wheres virgil  seems a shame just to dump it  it is a nice boat  yeah its a nice boat  its a nice boat with a great big hole in the deck  and a bunch of guys with guns looking for it  oh yeah  thank you sam  yeah virg when this is over  if were not dead thank me then  all right sam  i dont know where he is hes holed up somewhere  listen we got a real problem here  well thats right  we want out of this  but those guys we took the boat from  theyre coming after us  if you could see your way to helping us  thats your problem  well seeing how we have your 10 million  i guess that makes it your problem too  now i know you guys didnt want to get involved in this  you wanted us to do your dirty work for you  its 10 million  i know you must have big plans for it  all right fine  you give us a time and a place  put the jamaicans there with my money  and well handle it  and then we walk away  cause if i see another barrel of chemicals  with my name on it  let me put it this way you bring me my money  and you got nothing to worry about  then you can disappear  talk to the jamaicans  ill see you tomorrow  virg get down  virgil how the hell did they find us  must have had a backup gps tracker  what happened you look awful  trust me sweet thing youd rather not know  i cant believe we didnt find that other tracking device  andres good and thats bad  do you want something to drink  yeah that sounds good maybe a scotch  i wouldnt mind a little something if youre gonna  sam not now  we need to talk alone mom  we need to set up a meeting with andre and the jamaicans  hey mason just showed me the boat  i dont know those guys  yeah and when we saw them  there wasnt a lot of time for conversation  call the marina leave my number  andre knows what hes doing  hell have everyone from the harbormaster  to the guy emptying trash cans looking for us  ill see if i can stall mason  right on time yep  fear brings out the best in people  look i brought you some fries now that were friends  i havent had time to talk to the jamaicans yet  thats not good homer thats not good at all  i repoed their boat  its not like i can go down to the crab shack  and have a beer with them  i dont give a damn about the jamaicans  thats your problem i just want the money  im doing the best i can  i just need a little more time thats all  well heres a little incentive for virgil  his daughter got picked up on a traffic warrant this morning  they havent searched her car yet  but if they do  they just might find drugs under the backseat  pretty girls dont do very well in jail  the other girls tend to ugly them up real quick  dont know how long the poor thing would last  youll have your money tomorrow  so this is sams new ride  his girlfriend loaned it to him he loaned it to me  love is a beautiful thing  anyway are you sure  these guys arent gonna show up and surprise me  you probably have a few hours  theyre setting up surveillance cameras at your place  which room is his   i followed him here last night  the guy looked a little pissed  after that business with the personal massaging  you sure you want to upset him  hes here to make me behave  i do that he goes home i never find out anything  i need him here  if i cant make him a friend  the next best thing is an enemy  anyone with a security clearance is going to know  not to leave anything in a hotel room  theyll keep the important stuff with them  usually itll be in a secure laptop  with a few layers of encryption  means you cant break into it  but if youre just looking to make somebody angry  you dont need to break into it  put a big enough magnet where that laptops going to be  and you can turn it into an expensive paperweight  hello  andre its good to hear from you  doctors are wellknown to be the worst patients  similarly anyone with specialops training  is tough to protect  they think they can handle anything  wow  that shirt looks so good on you  youre the same size my husband was  oh i dont wear this kind of thing much  im glad you like it i do  thank you  are you sure this is all right  michael said you werent supposed to be out  dont worry i can handle myself  its fun sneaking out though isnt it  it is  have a drink man relax yourself  no im relaxed  you know you caused me quite a lot of trouble  at least do me the courtesy and have a drink  all right  flo let me get a rum punch for my friend here  so the money you stole  that was a payment for a debt  a large quantity of merchandise  delivered from one very powerful man to another  its my job to deliver this money  listen i dont want any  i take my job very seriously  i stay in business because  when someone trusts me with their funds  i dont let nothing or no one  come in the way of a safe delivery  i make a promise to my clients  i would sooner cut my own throat than leave a debt unpaid  do you think i would hesitate to cut yours  i just wanted to know what michael was doing  or where he was all those years  take it from me sweetheart ive been there  half that classified crap is so boring  youd tear your hair out  and the other half you dont want to know  i think i could handle it  i put up with his father for 30 years  dont be too hard on him  you get into that line of work  sweetheart something real bad is about to happen  i need you to keep your head down  and pretend you dont know me  what  i dont want you to get hurt do that for me please  so now that we understand each other wheres my money  we want to give you your money back  we just need to arrange a time and a place  so we come and get it  and what else is waiting for us when we get there  now andre youre just gonna have to trust us  stop  you come with us now  excuse me  yeah mon  good good  put him on the phone  its for you  for me  hello  its virgil  i was out to dinner with madeline im sorry  they must have had eyes on the street  so we do this tomorrow at noon  well exchange virgil for the 10 million  everything go well youll both get to go home alive  if not  enjoy your drink  i calmed your mother down  i gave her enough sedatives to knock out a trucker  did you ask her what the hell she was doing out  i told her to keep him inside  oh go easy on them michael  they snuck out  a woman needs a little danger  so what do we do about the cops and mason huh  well i expect theyre gonna be very disappointed  when they find out were giving the money to the jamaicans  but we dont have any leverage  they got virgils daughter mike  one problem at a time sam  first virgil then his daughter  we could take some of the money  hire her a lawyer  that could take care of it  that could take care of us too  i doubt theyll miss it mike  hello  you think you can play with me you son of a bitch  you destroyed all my files  oh its good to hear from you too  im right in the middle of something  you broke into my room  well i just wanted to get to know you better  now then im michael westen and you are  you dont need my name  i came down here to bring you a message back off  people get fired all the time leave it alone  oh good a message from who  i just wanted to send him a thankyou note  dream on pal  fi yes  my new friend just discovered i paid him a little visit  hell be moving hotels  ill stay on him  when something serious is going down  its a good idea to show up nice and early  so you can see the ground and assess the situation  mike i should go  virgils my buddy you dont owe him anything  they know me and fi  if you show up theyll think something is wrong  just cover us and keep an eye out  all right good luck  its cute this loyalty of sams  i really like this side of him  thanks for doing this fi  oh im not doing this for you  i promised your mom id bring virgil back alive  hey theyre right on time  lets make this trade make it quick  and get out of here before things get  interesting  yeah sam  your hunch about mason was right  cause he and the boys just showed up  yeah okay im ready for them  the cops are coming  all righty then  when enough people hate you  sometimes the only move is to just stand in the middle  and hope they kill each other before they kill you  hey what you doing man  what are you doing  i said stop it  stop it  anyone whos ever handled large amounts of cash can tell you  its one of the toughest things in the world to move  its heavy and dense dead weight  if its on fire of course  that complicates things further  freeze drop it  hey you get back  you calm down calm down  boys boys boys calm down  we have a little bit of business first  andre let virgil go  andre let virgil go  im gonna find you boy and im gonna kill you  and then youll cut my throat i know i know let him go  andre its the fumes that ignite  i dont even have to touch it  wait wait wait okay okay  have you two

call for backup  you call for backup  go go go  come on mike youd think wed be able  to keep a little more than this  we took what we needed  my daughter called shes pissed at me as usual  but shes home they dropped the charges  they had to with the jamaicans dead  and the cops in jail  but unfortunately  youre going to have to get out of town for a while  with this all over the papers  there are still a few people out there  who want to put a bullet in you  well ill just get the boat fixed up  and go down to the bahamas for a while  great  you sure youre not just trying  to keep me away from your sweet mama  hey virg  dont push it  okay  ill go make my goodbyes  gentlemen  i think youre even sam  yeah  whew  oh by the way i made some calls  talked to a buddy of mine at the fbi  looks like i got the charger back  lets just call it a thankyou gift  youre welcome sam  okay i need a beer  getting information out of someone  who doesnt want to give it up  is all about upsetting the targets emotional balance  impairing their judgment  fears good for that angers not bad either  hey buddy  i thought we could spend some more time together  you really dont understand the situation here do you  youre out man thats it  you should be in jail  jail thats interesting why jail  i dont remember ever doing anything jail worthy  hey hey hey  hey dont get cute  i want to know why i got
