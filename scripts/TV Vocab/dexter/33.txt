                previously on dexter  i found a fucking lead on the skinner case  the skinner is using treetrimming as a cover for surveillance  he watches from the trees and when the time is right he grabs them  mr king we met at the scene of our second victim   is that correct  yes that is correct  mario astorga  i dont know anything about anything  then why would george king suggest otherwise  what are you so afraid of mario  this is the shirt i was wearing when freebo met his end  thats his blood right there  this shirt implicates me in his death  i trust you and i want you to trust me  but hes being secretive hes never home he says hes with dexter  but i think its a cover  freebos final resting place  hiding a body in a cemetery youre fucking brilliant  we need to go after the root cause  bloodsucking soulless defense attorney  ellen wolf  we cant kill her   i see  this is personal  fuck yes this is personal  im asking you to do this for me as my friend   im sorry no  well then fuck you  someone loaned freebo some money and is willing to skin people to get it back  were gonna spread the word that anton knows where freebo is  which means that the skinner will be looking for me   what are you hiding  anton is not officially a ci  we used him as bait  i mean what are you in love with the guy  anton you in there  shit trimmed trees the skinners been here  im ready to get my hands dirty  ive always done the deed alone never stood outside  been a witness to this moment  youve set something in motion here  everything miguel does from now on is connected to you   today i wake up  kiss the wifetobe  feed the stepkidstobe  dress myself in the usual pants shirt  and pretense  but last night it was no pretense  miguel and i took a life  together  and today someone knows my truth  shares my reality  im not alone  sylvia good morning   sorry for coming over so early  its okay  but i need to see your face when i ask you  ask me  syl what is it  miguel was out till all hours last night  he says he was with you is that true  absolutely we were  just hanging   being guys you know  miguel was telling the truth  theres nothing to worry about dexter didnt get here till late   it was  it had to be almost midnight  miguel got home an hour ago  hes having an affair  you dont know that  when youve been married as long as us you know when your husbands lying  something to look forward to  maybe dexter knows where he went  i really dont  but  he did talk about a case he needed to look over   at the office  this really isnt your problem  i should go  you stay here for as long as you need to okay  ill just leave  work  with a detour on the way   how you doing you okay  im good  me too  its like there was an imbalance in the world and we righted it  with our own hands   it was deserving  i dont know i feel real  like maybe for the first time in my life  i know what you mean  but  if were thinking about continuing these extracurricular activities   absolutely   you need to work on your alibis  syl stopped by this morning wondering where youd been  shit  im a moron  i tried to cover for you but i thought you went home  im sorry man  i went over to jacks hideaway over on 57th i was like so wired  the next thing i know the sun was coming up  jacks hideaway  dont worry about syl i can handle that  i got a motion hearing this morning though  i dont wanna miss  ill get better at this with your help  i stalked a wifekiller at jacks hideaway last year  grabbed him right at closing  at 200 am  sylvia said miguel got home an hour ago  did he just lie  to me  another detour   theres nothing here either  well what about the blinds   what about the glass  checked em deb theres no blood  anton didnt just follow the skinner out of here  ill keep looking   i think we need to recanvass  weve already talked to everyone   and the kids theyre awake now  well talk to the kids   what do we got  the skinner has anton   did you see the trees  yes it doesnt mean he got nabbed  the coffee pot was left burning i mean he definitely left in a hurry  what was anton doing back in town  he never left   he wouldnt agree to surveillance  who cares if he agrees hes a ci  thats why we used him as bait in the first place  guys  no liner  the building trash dumpster  subscription renewal form from rolling stone addressed to anton briggs  this is his garbage  so the bag split on impact with the dumpster here  he threw it defensive move   why the hell didnt he use his fists  he was hurt  theres blood and some hair he hit his head against the wall  how bad  hard enough to daze him  a blow from behind could have propelled him forward  so anton comes down to empty the garbage  the skinner clocks him he does a header into the wall  throws the bag as a last ditch  skinner tosses him in the car and peels out got tire marks here  fuck  we got a confirmed missing person anton briggs  find a photo get his face out to all patrols and the media  set up a tip line  pull in some offduties to man the phone bank  skinners had him for 24 hours  how long do you think he can hold out  the mes report on the other victims suggests the skinner starts slow  probably to build fear antons a big guy a lotta skin  thats meant to be comforting   george king we need to bring him in  we gotta find him first  we got bolos out on him all night long  havent found him yet we could search his house though  we still holding kings foreman on resisting arrest right  he give us anything thatll buy us a warrant  mario astorga clammed up too scared of king  he would rather be

 i thought you  ive seen the fear an inch away from death fear  itd be a shame to leave your wife and your little baby behind  his is real  what makes you so scary george king  you miss your country george  i like this country sir i like miami sir  nicaragua can be a rough place huh  you in the military down there  death squads contras  you woulda been about the right age to get caught up in that  you learn a few things there george  i learn respect sir  no interrogation techniques  maybe a little snatch and grab what do they call that renditioning   oh i dont know that maam  maam sir  you did learn respect  did you show any fucking respect to wendell when you tore his skin off  how about anton when you bashed him over the goddamn head  you want a coffee  why dont you get a coffee  yeah  sure  he looks harmless doesnt he  they usually do  i dont know maybe hes not our guy  well you should trust your instincts on this one  this one of your creepy insights   why does it always have to be creepy  fucking tell me  hes held life and death in his hands  he likes it  i knew it  so how do i crack this sick fucks brain  from what ive read about these sick fucks  they usually have some sort of code  id say disrespect is high on his list of violations  maybe if you came at him with deference  deference huh  yeah think about it  lieutenant i heard you say your friend ellen is ill  was it a stomach thing because i just read this article  i dont know what it is i havent heard back from her  i left her three messages  im a little worried  yeah me too  i hope she didnt get in an accident or something  excuse me i have an errand to run  a home office  if she were sick this is where shed be  her cars here she could have gone for a really long walk  or borrowed a friends car  or maybe laguertas right and ellen is comatose  in some hospital postaccident  one can hope  not that there are any signs of foul play here  but harry did raise me to be paranoid  blood damn it  no miguel wouldnt do this we agreed ellen wolf is innocent  hello  its just blood theres no body  he would even know what to do with one i never taught him how to dispose  as far as miguel knows the best place to dispose of a body  is beneath an open grave  good thinking  setups are in the kitchen  any bites  no just nosy neighbors so far  syls office said that shed be here is she out back or  no she wasnt feeling up to an open house so im sitting it for her  youre a good friend  here you should have these  how about i make sure syl gets them  flowers are a good start but can i be honest  i like honest   youre an idiot  thats honest  you were smart enough to ask her to marry you  and shes still that same fantastic woman   you dont think i know that  youre not acting that way  i am not having a goddamn affair okay   lets say thats the truth  it is   either way you violated her trust  i just needed  space  ive got everything falling apart around me now you know  oscar ramon now my cases and  and the same things are falling apart for her  because shes your partner  youre a wise person arent you  if i am its only because ive learned from my many   many mistakes  you have insight  and i tell you what  im gonna follow your lead  so  point the way  mr king i understand that respect is very important to you  yes maam  and im sure you feel that people have to earn your respect  yes maam  i feel like youve earned this  whats the matter little gardener  you feel disrespected  youll get used to it in prison because your foreman marios next door  and hes spilling his guts  you are so sure hes afraid of you why  what did you do to him what did you do to anton  what did you do  fuck  help  help me  were supposed to be working together you keep going off halfcocked   how am i supposed to trust you  you trust me unbelievable  youre lucky batista wasnt watching the monitors what were you thinking  i was thinking about anton you oughta try it some time  i wanna find him just as bad as you do  if you gave a shit about anton  you wouldnt have made him your fake ci and he wouldnt be messed up in this  youre the one too busy boning him to have him protected   youre so crossing the line right now  am i  you knew anton was in town  and i fucking told him to call it in  you shouldve called it in your fucking self  i know its my fault  youre right  i used him  i just fucking used him  we can only hold george king for a few mo h hours  we better get back to work  schedule says there are four funerals today  graves backhoed last night  thats four miguel could have chosen from  shes not here thats one down  that blood might not even belong to ellen  could be a clients blood or the previous owners  he did it  miguel really did it  and i taught him how i guided him to this  i created  this  im sorry  miguels making his own choices now  look who he chose  she didnt deserve this  you can say it  wont change anything  whether i told you so or not  easier to accept it  cause therell be plenty more where ellen came from  no there wont  miguel is it too late to grab that lunch  so what do you think of this george king sicko  skinner suspect  i gotta go from here to your precinct  to discuss whether were gonna file charges against this guy   you think hes the guy  hes the guy  skinner  well if the law cant get him  you and i can  in fact  i could have this guy out on the streets in a few hours  you need some help on this one or is this another solo project   we agreed to leave ellen wolf alone  technically  we agreed not to kill her together  and we didnt   technically  i know thats  thats bullshit i didnt tell you   cause i know you wouldnt approve  she wasnt guilty  we have a different definition of that word  you got rid of her because she got in your way  whatever happened to serving justice  is that really why you do this to serve justice  we dont have to pretend with each other   thats what i thought  okay  i should have told you  it was a chickenshit thing to do and i abused your trust  a trust by the way that wasnt easy to earn  thats not lost on me  i gave you  my shirt linking me to freebos death  i wish i had another one to prove to you   how important this partnership is  id take a little remorse   you would know that i dont feel it  youll feel it if you get caught  i didnt leave any evidence theyre just gonna think it was  one of her scumbag clients  right  right just another lowlife who beat and stabbed an innocent woman  again  different definitions  this is the nature of a real friendship  were gonna disagree  and when we do we just go our own way  no no more individual projects  individuality is what makes america great  i dont think thats what our forefathers had in mind  look  im a big boy i know what im doing  eventually  youre gonna trust that too   ill see you over at the precinct  he thinks hes untouchable  hes not  its time he learned that  probably not a lot of leads on that screen  kings a ghost  he grabbed anton without a single security camera in the area  picking up him or his truck  theres not one shot to implicate him  so well have to get it out of king  you gonna let quinn do it on his own  my time is better spent here  away from people  you know someone  a good friend actually  told me i had a big wall around me  i thought it made me a better cop  i dont think it did  they look at him and see a defender of truth  justice and the american way  i see a man about to learn a hard lesson  tire tracks in the alley are consistent with kings truck  and several other thousand trucks in the miami metro area  kings company trims trees  trimmed trees were found in every one of the victims homes   thats the lead that nailed him  i dont know about nailed  the trees at my place just got trimmed too   but mario astorga  were talking about a foreman right  a foreman whos terrified of his boss  you can arrest my boss on that same evidence  hes the fucking guy  sir  may i  we really need your help on this one  and you do owe us for getting ramon off  i do but i cant very well charge  mr king with assault on a palm tree  you have your ways  youve bent rules before getting people lost in the system  we need to buy time for anton briggs  for you ill do everything in my power  well be right there  showtime  dex get your kit you too masuka   hey its called offduty  not anymore  you two you stay on king  dont let up we got another body  a female at the cemetery   cause of death  take your pick  sever beating strangulation  plus three stab wounds  whoever did this was not a fan  you have no idea  think our killers a pro i havent seen many body dumps this clean  i made sure of that miguel getting caught isnt part of the lesson plan  dont let her see this  no they said it was her   but its not is it  maria im sorry  no i dont believe  walk with me  too many people affected when the innocent die  that is part of the lesson plan  no one is untouchable i learned that the hard way so will miguel  his own vulnerability is about to become very real to him  after the stage show ends   they wont find anything  i know  so youre just  making a point  am i  we follow the code or else  there are a lot of other subtleties  but if thats what youve gleaned then yeah thats my point  youre a wise person  youre being facetious  you have insight  id be a fool not to follow your lead  i think youre gonna save my life  is this real  i should go make a statement to the press  i wouldnt want anyone getting ideas about  killing lawyers  lesson learned  it seems  oh good  good youre here come here taste this  this one  and now this one   which one  im more in the mood for steak  no this is for the wedding cake  we have to choose one   chocolate or hazelnut  is sylvia still here  no because of me  i intervened  apparently im a very wise person  apparently  according to miguel  he came to the open house i was sitting for syl  really  we talked for a while  actually i talked i just i gave him some insight  insight  he said he thinks i could  save his life   save his life  every word bullshit  when did he start lying with ellen before her  so chocolate  what about that shirt  the shirt  whats wrong  i have to look at some blood  evidence  for a crime hazelnut  why dont you head home get some rest  i cant i have to  do something  im here if you need me  tell me that were close on the skinner  cause this ellen wolf thing is about to take over   tips are bullshit so far  theyre gonna keep being bullshit   because no one saw king take anton  what about mario astorga   as tightlipped as king  maybe i can help   she could use a win right now  we all could   you gonna charge king  not with what you have  we release him hes in the wind antons dead  so has king asked for legal counsel yet  he knows we have nothing why would he waste the money  if hes not represented i cant walk in there and offer him any deals   not on the record anyway  no onell know the difference  still a year from now the recorded document shows up on cnn  actually  that cameras been on the fritz  it wouldnt surprise me if it didnt record anything  freebos blood  the link between his murder and miguel  if i go down i can take miguel with me  a mutual assurance a symbol of trust  thats it  no way were gonna let that monster walk  are we  i hope we meet again  id like to get to know you better  but how well can you really know someone  how much do you want to know  theres gotta be something  all we got is mario who wont say shit  we can start skinning him ourselves before hed talk  morgan were not skinning mario  i got a better idea  wanna share with the whole class  no just you  i need a partner on this  here we are  its too bad anton wont ever get to do that thanks to you  what   holy shit  you told him i revealed things  we didnt he knew you were in holding   he must have thought you caved  i didnt tell anyone anything  we didnt mean to get your family caught up in this well do everything we can  what can you do nothing  youre right we dont even know where this guy is  you gotta help me or i cant do anything to help you  then thats it im sorry  wait  he has a building  we went through all of his holdings no record of him owning any building  he rents it with cash he had me go there and pay once   hes trying to grow trees to sell  where  on 164th under the highway its all i know  go inside lock the door  ill send a patrol car go  it worked get in  anton are you in there  watch out  fuck restraint here  get out of the way  its me its okay  youre safe  i need an ambulance at the 164 and the 94 asap  get an apb out on george king  you found me you found me  you cant get away from me that easily  and the results are  come on ill take you home  i cant go home  theres too much silence  i know  you dont want to have to think about what she went through   only to realize shes really gone  dont  pero corazn shes gone  and thats gonna hurt like hell i know that too  but you have friends  you got me  im right here  im right here for you  to get you through  its not freebos blood  its not even human its bovine cows blood  hes been using me the whole time  i didnt create a monster i was used by one  he used me   you bet  today i keep up the pretense  but soon maybe tomorrow  miguel will know exactly how i feel  because finally theres an emotion i dont have to fake  today  i feel something real
