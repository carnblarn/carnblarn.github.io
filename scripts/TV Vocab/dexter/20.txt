                previously on dexter  my mother was murdered when i was a boy  i was there i saw it  for those murders  ones deceased ones doing life without possibility  and thats the only one thats still an open case santos jiminez   did you have to saw her into little pieces  did you have to leave two little boys  soaking in a pool of their mothers blood  i dont care what you did  its okay   who the fuck are you  pardon my tits  how could you do this to rita not to mention her kids  rita broke up with me okay  cause when youre around i kind of feel like i can deal with anything  your past is a bigger mystery than fucking jimmy hoffa  its time to make doakes go away  sergeant doakes is on administrative leave  pending an internal affairs investigation  the killers making us chase our tails   you know what that means  that he might be one of us  i was working on my piece and it just caught fire  i was so scared promise me that you wont  leave me that you wont go anywhere  im not going anywhere   i cant believe he said it even for masuka it was too much  and batista didnt do anything talk about lame he fucking sat there   you know how much i wanted to  is that the sports section  i used to enjoy quiet mornings but ever since the fire at lilas loft  shes been crashing here a bit too often   is that my shirt  i thought it was dexs  its not  its okay keep it  and so now i share the kitchen with a cobra and a mongoose  somebody drank all the coffee again  somebody didnt drink all the coffee  i had a cup dexter had a cup and it just kind of went like that  until the pot was empty   deb please  what  someone didnt drink all the coffee stupid question   why are you sticking up for her   im just trying to keep the peace  maybe we should stay at your place tonight  has the fire damage been repaired  the insurance companys dicking me around   wont pay me  dont worry   ill move out soon  stop leeching off your brother   whatever for  again thanks for sticking up for me   i am switzerland  yeah and im out of here  whats this  its the dragon zombie   cody likes to hide things in my bag  hes trying to control you  by hiding toys in your bag you have no choice but to return them to him  hes 7 he seldom has thoughts more complicated than the desire for candy  ill see you at your loft tonight  honey  honey no  you said we could make breakfast   i meant cereal baby  i dont want cereal  i guess i should give rita back her key  cody no no let mommy get the d  its dexter   he brought doughnuts  i did  i also brought a dragon zombie  i knew youd find it  hope its okay im here  could you watch them while i finish getting ready astor still has homework  thank you dexter  meet me at the car  good thing i dropped by  dont ever do it again   sorry  its too hard on the kids  and its too hard on me  its paul all over again  please dexter just stay away  notice we have some new faces  please make them feel welcome  our immediate task is to reexamine every criminal case  involving our 18 victims   where would you like us to start  by answering every question  as honestly and with as much detail as you can  excuse me sir   answering questions  that is correct  i can hardly expect you to investigate your own cases  what are you saying  are we under investigation  were now operating assuming  that our killer is somehow connected to law enforcement  whether he be a file clerk a dispatch officer   park ranger  or a police officer  or a police officer  is that why you brought in all these suits  special agents  sir you risk alienating every cop on the task force if you do this  we go where the chase leads us  even if it gets messy  its insulting  were as capable as they are of looking into our own cases  who wears a wool suit in the middle of summer in miami  nazis thats who its all about intimidation  and the idea that one of us could be the killer is complete bullshit  what do you mean us who  lundy has his feds investigating all of our cases  that are tied to the bay harbor victims thats good here  we gotta stand tough here we gotta make it clear to them  that were not gonna be their little yes sir no sir lapdogs  gentlemen  id like to go over some of your cases tomorrow  got them listed there  it would be helpful if you could gather up any notes you may have taken  happy to help   way to stand tough dexter  sorry  thats exactly how hitler walked  it seems my manifesto unintentionally helped lundy narrow his focus  thats what i get for trying to emulate lila and take the offensive  ive always worked best in the shadows and thats where i have to stay  lundys really pissing people off  hes got his whole crew looking through every case  involving any of the bay harbor victims   he sounds desperate  you know youre gonna be called in  ill be curious to see if i show up  okay james you need to be a little careful here  if you wanna keep your job you gotta cooperate  being on suspension does not exclude you from this  and who was it that suspended me again oh shit that was you  please dont act like you didnt deserve it  your case is coming up for review in a week   if you wanna keep your job  you keep saying that  what makes you think i wanna keep my job  are you just talking here  or is this something that youve seriously considered  well you and i both know that ive gone as high as i can over there  maybe its time to move on  well what would you do  i dont know  my father was a butcher maybe ill open up my own butcher shop  yeah i can just see you putting on an apron every morning  look i have a friend  hes the head of personnel at stillwater security  government contractors  theyre always looking for people like you  its a dangerous world out there they pay a lot of money to make it safe  yeah you got that right  alright set it up ill meet with your guy  officer morgan  yes  i picked the rodrigo case for you to look into  smalltime dope dealer arrested for murder  ended up walking free then disappeared off the face of the earth  until his body was found in a garbage bag in the ocean  not exciting enough for you  im homicide i mean  i thought you didnt want us checking into our own cases  youre new to homicide  at the time of this case you were still in vice no conflict there  im flattered you want me in on this but  batista and doakes were lead here  i feel kind of weird about investigating my own colleagues  weird gosh  id hate for you to feel weird  you know what i mean  would you have dinner with me tomorrow night  or would that make you feel weird  id love to have dinner with you  good  ill take you to the best restaurant in miami  great  i like the smell  dont you  like something exciting happened here  its like when a piece of bread gets stuck in the toaster  you like to pretend theres no poetry in you  so whats the problem with the insurance company  its ridiculous  they think the fire is of suspicious origin  and they need to finish their investigation  what do they meansuspicious  are they saying you started the fire on purpose  who knows what theyre saying  you know insurance companies anything to keep from paying out  especially when a fire has multiple points of origin  so you never told me  how did it go at ritas this morning  you know i just returned codys toy  and that was it  no quickie on the kitchen table  rita doesnt have a kitchen table  clever way of not answering the question  it was  awkward actually  always is  you cant go back you know that  im not trying to go anywhere  the beds all ready   i cant  and why would that be  i have too much work to do  i have all these case files i have to go over for tomorrow  you didnt bring any work with you  at home  i need work at home  goodbye then  so ill see you tomorrow  whatever  is it possible she started that fire on purpose  i cant imagine why  what i do know is that i cant take any risks right now   at least you wanted to  morgan  come in  can i offer you some tea  no thank you im  and he pours it anyway  hes trying to throw me off balance  show that i dont have the power to say no to him  how about some sesame crackers to go with that   so ill say yes to everything id love some  sorry guess i ate them all  asshole  so  you worked firsthand on what  four of the cases related to the bay harbor investigation  i believe so  your reports were a real pleasure to read  concise meticulous i appreciate that   good thank you  does your sister prefer meat or fish  you have more than one  sister  no just deb  or is she more of a salad kind of person   shes definitely a carnivore  good  so  the rodrigo case lets talk about that one  kind of blew it didnt you   im sorry  anthony rodrigo  crack dealer with an apparent habit of killing people who got in his way  i believe this was  yes doakes and batistas case  they finally tied rodrigo to one of his victims  built a solid manslaughter case  would have got him off the street for a few years  but the case largely rested on the bloodwork that you did  bloodwork that in the course of the trial was proven to be well  wrong  so you  one of the most cautious and precise forensic specialists  ive had the pleasure to work with you performed bloodwork  that directly led to rodrigo walking free  i asked myself  how the hell did that happen  and did you answer dexter blew the case on purpose  so that he could get rodrigo off the streets for good  with a cordless reciprocating saw  im sorry youve caught me offguard here  sloppy bloodwork  this wasnt my idea  could have said no  come on angel we have a job to do  since when my job is trying to prove  to a fellow police officer im not a killer  thats not about that   what is this about  its about finding someone  who had motive and opportunity to kill all 18 of our victims  no way its anybody in our department  then help me prove it  go through the rodrigo case with me it is not just you  laguertas cooperating on her old cases even matthews is coming in  the rodrigo file  you just happen to have it with you  im a reasonable man  you know how it is  the defense attorneys bring in their socalled blood experts  to counter everything i say  im familiar with the process  i understand how this may look like sloppy bloodwork to the layman  thats what rodrigos defense convinced the jury of  but as you can see  the lowvelocity blood drops clearly point in the direction  opposite to that in which we know rodrigo to have fled   which makes it impossible  except those lowvelocity drops  were revealed to actually be 90degree passive drops that were given tails  due to the angle of the floor  perhaps but if you then examine   the blood trail  which we know isnt a blood trail  but projected blood  youre not winning me over here morgan  the truth  by all means  i was overworked i was carrying half a dozen cases at once  it was a heat wave means a spike in  homicides  this one got pushed aside  i didnt write up my summary until an hour before the trial  i obviously overlooked a few things  a murderer walked free  because you were overworked  yes  whos this guy lenny asher  lenny hes a nutjob  but it says he lived next door to rodrigo filed all kinds of complaints  but he filed complaints about everybody  he sat at his window all day  and call us every time he saw someone move  he called us once to say there was something weird  about the clouds  still no harm talking to him right  lenny asher  who the hell are you  detective batista this is officer morgan  were with the miami metro homicide  can we come in  whos dead   anthony rodrigo  i know they found him in the ocean  i hope a whale ate him and shat him out  and then ate him again   you werent too close to him right  he was scum  yeah you made numerous calls about him when he used to live here  he was a drug dealer he played loud music  urinated on my lilies  you actually saw that  they were dead thats all i needed to know  any thoughts as to who might have killed him  how the hell should i know  look at that joker parked right in front of the fire hydrant  i got his license plate though  that would be our car  you take a lot of notes  anything hinky happens outside this window   i note it  how long you been doing that  since someone stuck a nail in my tire  march 1998  rodrigo was last seen alive the day after his trial  april 16 2002   think you took any notes that day  if something happened i did  you still have those notes  here 2002  what kind of order did you put them in  i told you 2002  i have no idea if lundy bought my excuse  either way it makes me a little anxious  to see my sister looking through the rodrigo files  looking for me  youre never gonna guess what i found  what did you find  an apartment   great  onebedroom near 78th and harding  big change  its time you know   good for you when do you move  as soon as possible  but not tonight i have a date  i thought you broke up with gabriel  its someone new  lundy  lundy special agent lundy  hes at least 20 years older than me what do you care  i dont  i mean  im sure you wouldnt do anything like that  what are you talking about do what  like try to sleep your way to the top  you douche  that is so not true  no of course not i shouldnt have even said anything and im sure  that thought would never even occur  double douche  you are not allowed to talk about anyone i date  as long youre seeing little miss pardon my tits  i am sorry dex but she is gross  and pale and nobody is pale in miami  she is obviously a vampire  a gross englishtitty vampire  you just described the perfect woman  truth is i need to avoid lila for now  harry taught me that the key to survival was staying one step ahead  but lundy almost trapped me today  i cant be unprepared like that again  hey its me  why arent you here im starving  i thought you knew its my bowling night  bowling really  what like fred flintstone  im more in the barney rubble category  how fun  id love to watch you bowl  its not really a spectator sport  well ill close my eyes  but its sort of the guysnight out  come on dex i want to meet your friends  where is it what time is it give me the address  starlight lanes 1690 michigan avenue  700  i guess im going bowling  go dexter  he only got three pins down  i like to celebrate the little things in life  if you like little things im your man i mean im not little everywhere  some places im just perfectly average  you are perfectly adorable  why you got a hug and i got a pat on the nose  cause youre like a retarded puppy  your ass does the cutest little thing when you bowl  if you guys will excuse me i need to use the ladiesroom  shes pretty hot  yes she is  nice place  very  gray  yes the bureau have always been known for their fashion sense  honestly all i care about is the kitchen  you cook  like i said best restaurant in miami  really  youre gonna cook for me  well dont ever expect me to return the favor  unless youre a big fan of toast  i would love to eat your toast  gosh that sounded wrong  so whats for dinner  steak florentine and grilled potatoes italianstyle  fuckinga  theres that mouth again  im sorry  its just the way i talk  and if were gonna be together you better get used to it  cant change who i am im crass and  dirty and  i have a very filthy mind   youre also pretty adorable  i know  now start peeling potatoes  i like a man that takes control  wash your hands first  youre so turning me on  you know considering our age difference youre not too old to spank  no stop please  i cant control myself  my god  sure you dont wanna grab a beer with us  nah thanks im tired  i hope you saved enough energy for me  that doesnt look like the look of love  sorry i really am tired i think im gonna go home  help help  somebody please come  god  you ok   dexter youre bleeding  its not deep   i mean what the hell  he tried to grab my watch  its stupid i should have let him have it  it was reflex   sure youre ok  yeah im fine  jesus christ they sell anyone a gun in florida wont they  yeah i know scary right   anyone get a license plate  no it was all too fast   you want us to take you to a doctor  no really im fine  ill take care of him  so  who was it  who  that man he wasnt trying to rob you he was trying to kill you  santos jiminez the man who murdered my mother  my god dexter  he must have followed me to the bowling alley   if you hadnt have seen him in time  i saw him thats all that matters  none of this scares you  nothing you could do dexter  would scare me  i believe you  come here  whatever comes  well get through this together  im not leaving your side dexter  im not leaving yours  really  why would you think that  youve just been a bit distant lately  i get that way when im stressed  what are you stressed about  right now nothing  do you think dexter will come for breakfast tomorrow  i dont think so honey  well maybe we should call him  its kind of late  but dexter stays up late  she doesnt want to call him  why not  dexter and i broke up   why  they dont like each other anymore  thats not true  does that mean he doesnt like us either  no of course he likes you  its just thats hard  when two people break up  it makes them sad to see each other  i dont think dexters gonna be coming for breakfast for a while  sorry  lila may be the right woman for me but shes wrong about one thing  recovery simply isnt an option  when i let my guard down i open myself up for attack  or capture  i need to embrace who i am who ive always been  i need to kill the man who murdered my mother  id almost forgotten this feeling  driving toward a kill  all my senses sharpened  its like ive been living underwater  holding my breath and now i can finally breathe  so how come its so suffocating in here   its nice to see you  yeah feels all warm and comfy  i spoke to todd about you  yeah  hes very interested  he said someone with your specialops background  typically starts at about 200000   i could live with that  you can meet him tonight   ill be there  i appreciate your time  can we get this over with sir  its interesting that of the 18 victims  and you worked on cases involving 4 of them  and you were unable to obtain a single conviction  the smith case thrown out because of inadmissible evidence  orozco skipped bail never to be seen again  the rodrigo case lost due to bad bloodwork  excuse me  you werent aware of that  the d a didnt get a conviction thats all i know  are we through here sir   no actually were just  were done  look at this  june 1st mrs holcomb takes out trash  drops soda bottle doesnt pick it up  march 17th  airplane flying too low  i told you this guys a fruit bat  april  its the month we want  april 16th  fuck me sideways listen to this  rodrigo gets into car parked in wrong space  must be drunk because someones carrying him  the plates here this is from 900 the night he disappeared  last time he was seen alive we gotta run that plate  whoever owned this car is our killer   ill get lundy  hes out with his feds  im calling him in  lila almost had me believing it was possible  to change to become something else  as if that ever really happens  ive always known what i am  if the glove fits  a secret cabin in the middle of the everglades  what more could a rededicated serial killer ask for  cocaine  apparently mr jiminez never gave up his old habits  what a bad bad man  what you think it just turned on by itself  there is no such plate  is that a 1 or an i fuck you lenny  fuck your handwriting  kind of busy here  then can you please tell me where i can find dexter  i brought him some dinner   dexters not here  where is he  how should i know  he said he was working late  is that what he told you  what do you mean  hes not working late  i think he lied to you  men are such pigs  im so sorry im sure hell show up  hes very excited about this job  i swear ive tried every combination nothing is coming up  i told you lenny would be a waste of time  maybe its not a florida plate  try georgia  holy shit here it is  the vehicle was registered to charlie lewis  i know that name  a drug dealer out of new york  a tough guy  likes to carry a bigass knife  thats our guy thats the bay harbor butcher  i told you he wasnt a cop  what  shit  where is he  according to this south bay correctional facility   what for how long  shit  charlie lewis was arrested april 12 2002  thats four days before rodrigo was seen being carried into the car   who had his car one of his gang  this is where it gets really bad   the vehicle was seized as evidence  by who  by our department  where was the vehicle held  right here in our evidence lab behind a secure gate  someone signed the vehicle out picked rodrigo up  killed him and then signed the vehicle back in   so you have records  why would we keep them  the only people allowed access to those vehicles  are members of the miami metro police department  holy shit  bay harbor butcher is one of our own  we keep this to ourselves for now  just the three of us  im gonna go tell it to a bottle of scotch  here we are again  what what the fuck  i know i keep asking myself  that same question   let me out of here  but  im finding its best to accept things you cant change you know  normally id have a chat  to make sure you understand why youre here but  i think you have a pretty good idea  let me go  i got cocaine  you can have all of it  its funny you should say that i am off the wagon  but that was never my drug  ill fucking kill you  no mr jiminez  im gonna kill you tonight  for what you did to my mother  and because well this is what i do best  its kind of fitting dont you think  astor cody come on lets eat   howd you get the door unlocked  it was already open  thats odd  dexter hi  look im sorry to bother you and im sure this is nothing  but i was just wondering if by chance you were at my house   well no  its just that the door was open  and youre the only other one with a key  rita get out of the house call the police  ill be there as soon as i can  i cant leave you here  i cant take you with me  dont go anywhere  hey im sorry to drag you into this   no im glad you called the kids  next door  the place is empty no sign of forcible entry  im guessing you just forgot to lock the door   if you need anything else  no youre not leaving  sir  someone was in this house  i need you to stay here in the house until i tell you its safe  really i need to do those things  im with miami metro homicide i know you dont take orders from me  but if you like i could get lt laguerta on the phone  if you prefer to speak to cpt matthews i can arrange it too   dexter whats going on  please just stay here okay  its one thing to fuck with me another to fuck with  my exgirlfriend who hates me  the lila experiment is officially over  give me ritas key  well thats your fault isnt it dexter  you lied to me about working late  and i thought i might find you there  do not ever go to ritas house again  do you understand  do you understand  is this the monster that you keep telling me about  trust me when you meet the monster youll know  you called jiminez  yeah i suppose i did  why  why would you try to have me killed  you werent going to get killed thats why i did it at the bowling  so all your policeofficer friends would be there  what were you thinking are you insane  i was trying to bring us back together again  you were pulling away and  remember at the hotel  after you faced jiminez  thats thats what i wanted  to bring you back  so you called him  well it worked didnt it  last night  you and i  you fell asleep in my arms  what  you are more dangerous than my addiction will ever be  thats saying a lot  stay away from rita  stay
