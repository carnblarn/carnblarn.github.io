police  doakes doakes   you all right  yeah  the suspects name was jacques bayard according to his drivers license   haitian  thatd be my guess  all right lets go over it again  i saw a gun in the suspects waistband  i went to question him and he took off running when he saw me  angel you saw all this  yeah i saw bayard bolt  and i turned the car around in pursuit  all right and when you went under the causeway  he took a shot at me  i took cover and returned fire from that corner  no not from there  yeah from fucking right there  but  if you shot him from right there  the  blood spatter would go in that direction look at the patterns  you questioning me cause i got questions for you  the mans just doing what hes supposed to do  the man is a fucking creep job  james just focus on the facts okay  the das team is ready for you you good  im good  yeah youre up next  sorry but i didnt invent physics  he just got mixed up is all  hell im not even sure what the hell happened  trauma can

b word dont you  well rudy is my goddamn boyfriend  so stop making bullshit excuses  honestly our last double date was a little awkward  i just want to make sure this ones gonna stick  well thanks for the vote of fucking confidence  dex rudys different  i feel safe with him i think  im falling for him  excuse me where can i find dexter morgan  right here  oh that was easy  an urgent registered letter  maybe you won a sweepstakes   dex you got a second  yeah  hey you finish your report on the shooting  im walking it up to ia right now  you still think doakes version doesnt add up  blood never lies  shit  listen um  can you sit on that till i talk to doakes  here  now its yours to sit on stand on do what you want   thanks  youre welcome  you know its a federal offense to read someone elses mail  we regret to inform you of the death of your father  dad died 10 years ago  this isnt about harry  joseph driscoll of dade city  florida names his son  dexter morgan of miami  as his executor  its a will  well he cant be your biological father  dad said he died before you came to live with us  he wouldnt make a mistake like that  the bodys awaiting cremation while they notify the next of kin  im your only next of kin  dont you fucking forget it  oh  and i inherited a house  i know the truth  because harry always told me the truth  he had to  he was teaching me principles a code  he knew what i would become without it  so joseph driscoll of dade city must have been mistaken  you know what this is  this is dexters new birth certificate  the  adoption finally went through  youre a morgan now  i thought i was already a morgan  well you have been to us but its official now  it took a long time and a lot of hurdles   this is an important day for us  hey dad  how come you never told us what happened to dexters real parents  well they died  i know but how   i dont know  lets not talk about it  no how did they die dad  it was an accident a tragic accident  so have you found out anything else about this joe driscoll  well i looked online i even   looked at police records there are no birth records  no drivers license just the deed to the house  and a mention in the local paper about his bowling team  thats odd  yeah i spoke to the probate lawyer  the guy who drafted the will  and apparently joseph driscoll was an insurance adjuster of sound mind  with no doubts about who i was  dexter youre not feeling any of this are you  youre obviously so overwhelmed that youve shut down  maybe  its too much for you to handle  yeah i guess  so i think i should come with you  oh no you dont have to do that  trust me youll need me  i fell asleep  sex like that takes a lot out of a person  so are we still seeing your brother for dinner friday night  no  hes got to go to dade city  whats in dade city   i told you he was adopted right  yeah  some dead guy up in dade fucking city thought he was  dexters biological father  and left him a house  really  man  its a mistake a big one  still though thats got to  open up some old wounds  when are you leaving  me  im gonna stay in bed with you all weekend  i thought you two were close  we are  dex just likes to deal with things on his own   he doesnt need my help  or  he doesnt know how to ask for it  i left a message so we wouldnt have to have this conversation  yeah which is why i hustled over here  so we could hash this out like adults  admirable paul but this adult is still going out of town  not if it means blowing off my scheduled visit with my kids  thats not your call  the kids are already settled at colleens  you can have your visit when we get back  its just that i already laid out cash for the tickets  a death in the family trumps the circus  dexter is not your family i am  you ready  hey paul  better hit the road  they should have served a cardiologist with these burgers  we had to eat them  junk foods the unwritten rule of the road  its nice  the lawyer said there should be a key under the mat  are you my new neighbors  no  no were just here to clear up some things with the estate  so sad about mr driscoll  he was only 60 you know  too young for a heart attack  he used to clean my gutters every fall  i dont know what im gonna do now  unless you know how to clean gutters  were not gonna be here for that long  but uh you have a good day  a bachelor lived here thats for sure  well we can head back tomorrow morning  as soon as i straighten things out at the morgue  i dont want a house in dade city  which means its gonna need to be packed up  and i dont think anybody else is gonna do it so  i guess that leaves us  told you youd need me   hey james  hey man  ia is pressing me on my report of the shooting  yeah  theres just one thing that i cant get clear on  its pretty clear from where i was standing  yeah  except  i could have sworn that i heard your 9millimeter go off  before the 38  now theres lots of reasons it could have gone down that way  if bayard even just aimed at you  its  still all right to shoot  except he shot first when i came around the corner  yeah maybe youre confused about that too  because the bloodspatter report says   it couldnt have gone down that way  you saying im a liar  no im saying that maybe youre not remembering right  this may come as a fucking shock to you angel  but youre not the only honest cop in miami  look i just want to know   why a man is dead  you want to come at me you come at me straight  you want it straight i did not see a gun  angel  i need to talk to you  help me out man   is that joe  must be  its weird but he looks a little bit like you  but  not really  those seem to be the only pictures in the house  theres no family or kids photos  lonely   dexter hi  hey  surprise  i know you cant ask for my help but  its my duty to you know  help while you deal with old wounds  or wha jesus whatever im here  so it appears  and this is rudy  ive waited a long time to meet you  and you must be rita  hi  he came here for me  for the both of us  isnt he great  a lot of work to pack all this up  even with the four of us itll take us the whole weekend  the whole weekend where should i put our stuff  its too eerie sleeping in a dead mans house  i saw a motel 6 on the way in  we could stay here and save the money  i mean it is late  and wed probably get more packing done if we stayed here  its up to you dex  just say the word  as long as you dont mind the sofa bed  okay ill go look for some clean sheets  how did a death turn into a couples weekend  luckily i get up earlier than normal people  coffee  thanks  ive got to hit the morgue  want company  no   thank you though  its private  i get it  i gave joe a physical once a year like clockwork  so no history of heart disease but it happens  it appears so  we were about to send him to a crematorium when we found you  we thought  his son should have a chance to pay his last respects  im not his son  estrangement in a family is a shame but  death is the great unifier  thats an interesting tattoo  joe said he picked that up in nam  you can be proud he was a patriot  uh perhaps he was also an exconvict   excuse me  its a prison tattoo  its done with a pen and ballpoint ink  its three or four decades old judging by the fade  son i knew joe he was no exconvict  he was a good man  a quiet man  and a damn good bowler  howd you determine cardiac arrest  was there damage to the coronary artery  its uh professional curiosity  i work in forensics down in miami  i see  well uh i found microaneurisms in the retinas  its common with seizures during a heart attack  its also a sign of diabetic retinopathy  son i may be a smalltown doctor  but i know a heart attack when i see one  who knows what caused it   stress  inactivity  french fries   but knowing wont bring him back  its hard to accept so many unanswered questions but sometimes  no youre right  dr pittman  yeah this is really hard  you mind if i just take a minute alone with  dad  ill be next door in my office  masuka  hey its dexter morgan  dude i know your last name  i need a favor a dna comparison  i thought you were away with the girlfriend  what she surfing the crimson wave  im just helping out a local agency  im gonna send you two blood samples  i need it asap  do a tox screen will you  hey romeo if this is your idea of a romantic weekend  youre gonna be a bachelor  for a very long time  yeah  run another iv lets keep his blood levels volumized  whats his pressure  its 80 and dropping  we may need to do a belly tap  hey dex buddy im here   it hurts dad  what happened  he  tried to climb a fence to get debras ball  but a dog chased after him  and he fell on a wroughtiron post  is he gonna be all right  we can keep him stable for a while  but hes gonna need surgery to repair some internal bleeding  and thats a problem  can we talk over here please  dex ill be right back  hold your brothers hand sweetie  okay the complication is with your sons blood type  i dont want to talk about this  why are you being like this  you dont need to mention that in front of anybody  are you crazy he could die  you got to do something quick youve got to go now  so you heard the 38 go off  before sergeant doakes 9millimeter  then i went under the causeway and i saw the suspect  mr bayard  mr bayard on the ground  his gun lying next to him  and youre sure it was mr bayards gun  well the 38 wasnt mine  and sergeant doakes had his niner in his hands  did you see mr bayard carrying the gun  before the foot chase began  sergeant doakes did  did you see mr bayard acting suspiciously  did you know mr bayard worked as a janitor  i   how the fuck would i know that  never got so much as a parking ticket  since he immigrated from haiti 15 years ago  he got a lot more than that this time didnt he  are you sure you heard the 38 go off  before sergeant doakes 9millimeter  joe bought this house outright in 1976  paid cash  no records before that  no records  no childhood photos  the guy was 60  but its like his life started when he was 30  you know youre right  hes right  so what happened between years one and 29  maybe he butchered his entire family  yeah  or he walked out on his two wives  and a lot of bad debt  the guy was a loser after all  who else owns this many bowling balls  what do you think dex  i think joe spent some time in prison  probably mixed with some bad people  maybe he had to hide from them  whatever it was drugs were involved   narcotics anonymous  paul used to get these  except he never made it past the welcome chip  looks like joe was clean for  let me guess   well joe said no to the drugs  but not his rock n roll  nothing in his collection post1980  got to love a purist  oh good dancing   hello  hey babe its paul  just making sure dear dexter  is dealing decently with his dead dad  were fine  everyones fine ok   well see you on monday  no no no  talk to me  you having fun  cause im not   paul  i would have  i could have taken my kids to the circus  wed be eating peanuts right now  stepping in elephant shit  paul this is not helping my confidence in you  oh i think youve got enough confidence for both of us  look if you want to work  towards building more visitation days not less  you need to avoid this kind of behavior right here  now i think you might just want  to politely hang up  okay  youre right  im sorry  you have a great weekend  a secret life   the only thing joe and i have in common  theres nothing else in this house to connect us  hiding out  cleaning up  i can only imagine what youre going through  a lot of lemonfresh joy  you joke  its good defense by the way  thank you i think  still  the possibility has got to be weighing on you  what possibility  that joe  could actually be your dad  the only way thats a possibility  is if harry was wrong and uh  thats just not possible  or he lied  dont you worry little man youre not gonna feel a thing  i thought there was a problem  you know the blood  your dad fixed it  see you have a very special blood type  ab negative  its hard to come by and our supply was low  but your dad knew somebody with blood just like yours  youre very lucky   can i have a moment with my son  yeah  hey dex  everythings gonna be fine  youll be good as new  i will  hey would i lie to you  when my father was dying  he just asked me for one thing   debera ser un hombre honesto  be an honest man  thats all he asked  i made him that promise  and thats why im a cop  now this haitian man is dead  and i dont know why  but i know it aint right  but if i talk  ill be a rat to the whole precinct   but if i lie   hold up  go ahead  the blood spatter doesnt match doakes report  also  i heard doakes 9millimeter go off before the 38   but he must have had good cause  so doakes fired first  doakes fired first  i hope tunas all right  mmm love me a little mercury  thats dexters  oh hes out stealing garbagecan space from the neighbors  criminal  i like it  its the station  morgan here  wait  did i call the hot morgan by mistake  freudian  my subconscious has been exposed  well zip it up and tell me whats going on  i got the results  on doakes shooting has he been cleared  on the dna test  what dna test  you trusted dad your entire life  so why question him now  am i missing something  dna test  masuka called  your biological father was dead  dad told us that  i remember  so the dna came back negative  it was a match  joe driscoll was your bio dad  interesting  do you think dad  lied  i think he might have known joe was here  five hours up i95 my whole life  well he must have had a damn good reason  and im not gonna let some guy you didnt even know  draw him into question  deb im not questioning anything  thats why you got a tox screen too  i need to clear my head  where are your car keys  deb i ordered the tox screen because  joe had no history of heart disease  and the coroners report was inept  you did it  because for some reason he is important to you  it was professional curiosity  then you will be professionally glad to know  that the only toxin in his system  was a sedative  which he probably took to  i dont know sleep  that would surprise me  joe was 30 years sober  i havent found anything stronger  than advil in his medicine cabinet  it wouldnt be the first time an addict fell off the wagon rita  or someone slipped him the sedative  so he wouldnt struggle when he was injected with something  like  diabetic insulin  it can cause cardiac arrest  weve seen it before  its nearly impossible to detect  unless you can find a point of injection  which i wasnt looking for but if i had a chance   to examinate the body i   jesus christ  hes not even your family  mom and dad were  i am  are you gonna start questioning me now  you why would i   joe driscoll was obviously bad fucking news  which is why dad didnt want you to know anything about him  doesnt that matter to you  i dont know what you want from me  i want what dad wanted  i want nothing to do with this guy  lets just finish packing up this crappy house  and walk the fuck away  all right that sounds like a good plan okay  i guess i understand why deb is upset  we both idolized harry  lived by what he taught us  though deb never had to be taught  not to kill innocent people  thats why she doesnt understand  why i need to know  howdy neighbor  let me get that for you  well thank you  i was just wondering   did you happen to notice any visitors over at joes last week  visitors  oh im not sure  im just wondering if he has any outstanding bills   a gardener maybe or a delivery person repairman  well come to think of it there was a um  cable repairman here last week  he was polite  but you know he couldnt fix my tv antenna  you remember what he looked like  well he had dark hair  average height  normal i suppose  i did some checking on our suspect jacques bayard  you lending ia a hand  i just like to know whats going on in my department  and what is going on  turns out mr bayard changed his name  when he immigrated here  used to be rene thibault  a former officer in the haitian military  didnt your tour in the army include some  special op in haiti  right  special means you dont talk about it  but i know youve heard as many horror stories as i have  about what went on down there  with those death squads  what were they called  tonton macoute  yeah the bogeymen  they did a lot of terrible things  killed a lot of people  they made mothers carry the heads of their dead sons  forced fathers to rape their daughters  they tied cinder blocks around peoples necks and drowned them  and put mutilated bodies in trees  and killed anybody who tried to take them down  this man jacques bayard  if he did those things  he deserved a lot worse than he got  dont worry james  itll be over soon  i know it will  if joe was shot up with insulin there will be an injection welt  maybe between his toes or in a freckle  if its there ill find it  small towns  come on dr pittman which crematorium did you send joe to  hey you stop come on  get in  heard you sneak out  took a guess where you were headed  figuring id need a ride  figured i could talk you out of it  no such luck huh  deb will be delighted  as far as i know you went out for a walk  jesus dex did you steal something  well my fingerprints were all over it  i figured it was prudent to get rid of the evidence  its just a box of ashes   joe was cremated then  yep  guess you werent able to find out  if he was injected with anything  no   what are you gonna do with him  i dont know  hmm dumpster  i have a better idea  you know  no matter what harry said  no matter what deb thinks  thats your father  cardboard box  i know you dont want to acknowledge it  which is why youre running around breaking and entering  searching for some killer  but you took that  because theres a part of you  that knows that this  that box  is your real father  my father  sounds strange  i know  you all right  i was just getting some air  oh hey i found something in joes closet  its just a bunch of papers  theyre over there  any clues  hey buddy   how you feeling  good  it kind of itches but they have ice cream here  lifes a tradeoff  what are you making there  a thankyou card  see the nurse brought me the crayons and everything  whos it for  well she said i should thank the man who gave me the blood  i mean  thats normal right giving thankyou cards  yes it is  its just that hes gone  and we wont be seeing him again  im sorry  thats all right  it doesnt really mean anything  yeah it does  you keep drawing son  ill make sure it finds him  okay  you had the case dropped  excuse me  ia dropped doakes case  do you seriously think i have any say  over what ia does  i put everything on the line  i told ia the truth  and theres a lot of evidence to back that up  what the hell happened  maria i deserve to know  all i know is that ia got a call  from an agency in washington   what agency  im guessing military  they said the case involved some   sensitive foreignrelations issues  so they were gonna handle it from there  they disappeared it  i always knew doakes had a history with them  i figured special forces  but this kind of reach   you think it was black ops cia  maybe  probably  and i ratted him out jesus christ  angel  you did what you thought was right  squeak squeak  do you have a problem  officer benson  you just bumped into your superior  i believe you owe detective batista an apology  yes sir  im sorry sir  i know i should be sorry that  we met under these circumstances  but truthfully  i think it was the best way to get to know you  realtor says you wont get much for it  more than if i kept it  are we good  were fine  all right  ill see you back at the station  cable repair man  wait wait no no dont go  wait  please i want to ask you something  wait  alone again  finally  you know what  im glad you were here  thought you would be  the cable repairman   did he say anything about my tv antenna  no  rita its me  theyre asleep  yeah well i should have been here okay  its late and youre drunk  and you cant keep coming by here unannounced  you dont call the shots okay  paul i want you to leave  i dont give a fuck what you want  i want my fucking kids  youre gonna scare them  they dont want to see me  those kids are gonna remember who the head of this fucking family is  youre right  ive been awful  i just didnt realize i was hurting you so much  but i can make it up to you  let me try  where are you going  want to play rough huh is that what you want  no no  fucking whore  come on come on  wake up wake up come on  i had a father  someone other than harry who called me son  the thought never even occurred to me  harry was all i needed  it was harry who always had the answers  he knew who was good bad safe  and dangerous  i built my life on harrys code  i lived by it  but harry lied  why would he do that  what else dont i know  my concrete foundation is turning to shifting sand  maybe rudy was right   you never can truly know anyone
