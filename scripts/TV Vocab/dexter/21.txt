own  dexter and i broke up  does that mean he doesnt like us either   have dinner with me tomorrow night  id love to have dinner with you  your past was a bigger mystery than fucking jimmy hoffa  its time to make doakes go away  sgt james doakes is on administrative leave  pending an ia investigation  are we through   no were just getting  were done  theres my sponsor  this woman sees me  i didnt care what you did  shes looking behind the mask and shes not turning away  you a friend of dexters  im his decorator love the hat  help please  i need to embrace who i am i need to kill the man who murdered my mother  a secret cabin in the middle of the everglades  what more could a rededicated serial killer ask for  its kind of fitting dont you think  its just that the door was open  and youre the only other one with a key  get out of the house call the police  i cant take you with me  someone was in this house   whats going on  please just stay here  stay away from rita  stay away from me   thats what i said  that im always right  that you were right about lila she was bad for me  and that im always right hurry the fuck up  i didnt realize how bad till last night  hey vince hows it going  she had me fighting with myself the whole time  all that selfreflection is unhealthy  stop reflecting and move  sorry  the fact is i already know who i am and im done fighting it  so the battles over lilas over  clean this mess up its a goddamn safety hazard  cant leave this shit lying around bro  nice my subconscious isnt even bothering with symbolism  thats what i get for leaving the remains of jimenez up in that cabin  bad time to get sloppy with special agent lundy  putting everyone in law enforcement under a microscope  what are you doing here  just wanted to give you that  youre in the same clothes as last night you slept here  not intentionally  i just wanted to make sure  whoever broke in stayed away  i guess i kind of fell asleep on the job  sorry  dont be  i made a killer robot that eats airplanes want to see  moms making pancakes you want bananas in yours  actually guys theres something i got to go deal with so  then whyd you come  cause you needed one of these  alright guys  dexters got work to do so go eat pancakes  add extra bananas for me  i didnt mean for them to find me here  well its okay i think they needed a hug too   take care dexter  wait i want to say something  im sorry  alright  i feel  such regret  which is rare for me  but not that i  dont mess up i do  just never so stupendously  i had you  and them  and i had us  so much to have  and i just  demolish it i honestly thought that i was smarter than that  rude awakening  lilas one of the biggest mistakes of my life  it means a lot to me dexter  but it doesnt change the fact that you slept with another woman   i cant forgive that  i dont expect you to i just  wanted to say it  all i can do now is pick up the pieces of jimenez  hes one big pile of evidence  not that anyone will easily break into that cabin the things a bunker  still i cant leave a kill lying around  ill have to call in sick at work  its not doakes  fbi  my feeble interview with lundy might have put me  on his short list of suspects  left turn to the cabin  right turn to a change of clothes and work  glad im at peace with harrys code again it makes decisions easier  caution first jimenez later  announcing the arrival of flight 274  from santiago dominican republic gate 20b  your call has been forwarded to an automatic voicemessage system  james doakes  is not available  to page this person press 5 now  you know what fuck you james fuck you and your disappearing act  you didnt just stand me up last night  you screwed yourself out of a 6 figure security job  which means that being a cop is one of the few options you have left  so stop pissing off the people that can help you  lundys people have been trying to reach you  they just want a hand with the bay harbor butcher case  james give it to them  show lundy that you are a team player  fake it  and pick up when i call again  im gonna keep calling  im not giving up on you james  your right eye is a little darker than your left eye  and you weigh about 50 pounds im gonna have to fatten you up  didnt seem to bother you last night  or this morning  so much for taking it slow  the slow part was nice  i guess thats the perk of dating a man whos experienced  read old guy  read what i said   experienced  as in technique  as in mad skills  are you always gonna be this touchy about the age thing that will get old  sorry  this is new territory for me dating in general  dating someone so young in particular  and dating a coworker especially   so im the more experienced one cool  youve dated coworkers  not that experienced  well ive seen enough of them to see where they go wrong  and experience tells me that  full disclosure is the best way to go  what like  tell people at work  im an aboveboard kind of guy  and in the history of office romances  sneaking around has never worked  i dont know  things are just so tense around the station right now  so youre worried about making people tense  i just think the timing is bad  maybe we should wait until we can  when  notify dc  then get cal to go sit on mendelsohn until he signs  and then call the field office and get me more bodies  well we need to move on this now   whats up  not sure  something break on the butcher  i gotta go  theres quiche eat it  wait shouldnt we finish talking about this whole  fulldisclosure thing  lundys bees are buzzing  something has agitated the hive  my moneys on connolly down in property  looks like much ado about something in there  lundys got a suspect for the butcher  and bro its one of us here  that   disturbing  were not sure lundy picked someone  but if he has it isnt one of my people  sorry but i confirmed it myself last night  its someone in this house   who in this house  i dont know  but something mustve broke  cause lundy shut us pd out of the task force brought more feds in  so he definitely has someone in his cross hairs  why not steinbauer in impound hes a freak  i bet its wykoff from records  what about loring in narcotics  or it could be that murderous morgan in blood spatter  maybe i was being watched this morning  but theyd do more than watching if they had proof  whats going on  you tell us   why would i know  youre lundys pet   fuck you  seriously  whats he got or is he blowing smoke  i dont know but if hes got something it aint smoke  hes too good to blow smoke  man no wonder youre his pet

better than mine  what are you doing here  my new place isnt ready i dont wanna make a habit of staying at lundys  what if people find out itd be a new reason to disrespect me  they may already know they keep assuming ive inside intel  theyre always asking me what lundy knows  what does he know tell me  fuck im talking about my feelings what the fuck is your problem  i know hes old and its complicated and whatever  but i feel like hes someone i can  count on  good you should have that cause i wont always be  who the fuck is that at this hour   deb dont  what the fuck  special agent lundy wants to see you   please come  wait  lundy didnt say anything about this to me  im sorry deb  im on the fucking task force i demand to know what  im right behind you theyre calling us in im right behind you  we got him  i should be panicked  terrified  but lila was right  the mask has been heavy  i wont need it in surrender i can let it go  the pain will come  when deb finally understands who her brother really is  ritas horror the kids tears  my old friends here to betray me  please sit down  im sure you heard we have a suspect in the bay harbor butcher case  put them on  we now have the evidence to back it up  we need answers  now  open it  explain it to us  trophies  thats what i thought  what happens now  i know this will come as a shock to you morgan  but our primary suspect is someone you know well   sgt james doakes  he was the lead case investigator on 4 of the butcher victims  which put him on my radar  we looked into his background it turns out his father was a butcher  and abusive doakes was also a trained assassin in special forces  that along with his onthejob shootings and excessiveforce citations   he fits the profile  yes  he has a need to dole out personal justice  yesterday doakes walked out of an interview and disappeared  this morning we were alerted he boarded a plane out of the country  that enabled me to get warrants on his apartment and car  he had the slides  carefully hidden in the trunk of his car at the airport  it all makes so much sense  everyone else in the precinct was beyond shocked when i told them  what exactly is sergeant doakes problem with you morgan  i kill people for one  but what was it sergeant doakes said about me  ive always sensed there was something  off about him  like hes hiding in plain sight   i never concealed my doubts  so he attacked you  well he might try it again  particularly when he finds out hes our prime suspect  yeah that should piss him off  weve tried to keep an eye on you from a distance   the undercover cars  not undercover enough obviously  im sorry for the abrupt pickup tonight  but from here on out well want a protective detail on you at all times  that could complicate my life  dexter it will keep doakes at bay   good point  what happens now is we need you  to analyze and match these slides immediately   me  im keeping the forensics inhouse  the public needs to see our strength now  their trust in us is about to take a major assfucking  i make you 1st forensic tech  in the chain of custody with these slides  i figure you have more motivation than most to see doakes brought to justice  so i know youll be thorough  the tsa is circulating doakess photo to all major airports  sergeant doakes  he peeked behind the curtain he saw who i am  but it only put him in the line of fire  theres an apb out on the eastern seaboard   i still dont believe it cause its not true   i dont know  dont vince  just dont  i didnt know  i swear lundy didnt tell me  i believe you  big fucking manhunt mobilizing out there  well get him dex  and when you do my story has to be stronger than his  dont worry ill be with you every step of the way me and this   i have an even bigger favor  name it  move into that new apartment of yours  if you got in the middle of this and you got hurt  hurt  im a fucking cop  youre my sister and im gonna worry like a brother not a coworker   dont you have enough to worry about  i cant help it  the best thing you can do for me  is to get me and my protective detail a wide berth  fucker  fine  i fucking hate it but i get it  one less pair of eyes to worry about  you just cant get rid of me can you  laguerta  you know i didnt do this  you know me maria thats not me  yeah but they dont   what do they have on me  they found something in your car  oh shit  the longer you stay out the worse it gets  the only way i can help you is if you turn yourself in   no one will listen without proof  of what  i dont want to pull you into this  the next time you see me theyll be no doubt  until then you wont be able to contact me  dont you disappear on me   maria i have to do this  god damn  listen to me  i want you to know that you meant a lot to me more than you know and  i just want to thank you for that  what does that mean  wait  looks like i wont find any prints or dna on this box  i can chalk it up to how careful doakes is  harry had strict rules about not hurting the innocent  and for all his fury   doakes is innocent  but theres also the n1 rule dont get caught  still hell fight this and ill have to disprove him  he could win  or he could end up paying for my crimes  morning  mr morgan  special agent lundy thought you might need our help  please come in  sorry about all the secrecy yesterday  we were reviewing sergeant doakescases and well you understand  i need you to do  the liquid extractions and centrifuging on these samples   the cells just started digesting  then well come back in 12 h  the samples should be watched at all times  dont let anyone in or out of the lab  and dont let the incubator dip below 37  and please dont touch anything  you understand  that was satisfying  are you okay man this shit with doakes is crazy   yeah i have to go  hold on  are you pissed or something about lila and me   oh yeah that  i dont want it getting between us   if you still want her  god no lilas insane destructive  a naturally occurring disaster   so you dont mind if i go for her  what no  look angel heres the real truth  lilas just using you to get at me   so what  so what  no ones used me for good or bad reasons since my wife divorced me  damn sure no one as hot as lila   you may be missing my point  look first it was the divorce  then getting stabbed was no picnic and now this thing with doakes  dark days my friend too dark  man i need a light at the end of the tunnel  and lilas it alright  alright then  angel just doesnt get it lilas no solution  shes a problem  shall we   just like my little groupies   i couldnt tell you  even with my brother at risk  we had him covered  it wouldve forced you to divide your loyalties  plus i didnt want to appear to favor you   they all think you favor me anyway  maybe because i do   you think they know  not until you tell them  special agent lundy   you give doakes to the press  best way to bring him in   if you publicly accuse him  im not accusing anyone  doakes is wanted for questioning thats what my press release says  itll still destroy him  hes doing a fine job of destroying himself   hes not your man  he is however my prime suspect  look  im willing to work with you on this  but only if you let me take lead with the media  lieutenant i am not letting you anywhere near the media  he may be your expartner he may be your best friend  what he is to me is a suspect  so you deal with that however you need to  and you will give me your complete cooperation  or you may find yourself out of a job  its mine  hey its me   i wasnt sure i should call  im glad you did  its probably best i move on but the kids were so happy to see you  yesterday and i wasnt   you know unhappy  well thats good right  i just i need to know one thing  is it over with lila  yes absolutely completely over  if i never see her again itll be too soon  i have feelings for you  i have feelings for you too  im not gonna fight them anymore  i think we should get together and talk  tonight  that would be great really great but tonights  no this is a bad idea  no rita its the best idea youve ever had  but weve got a big break in the bay harbor butcher case   things are kinda intense around here  did they catch him  someones gonna go down for it  but tomorrow would be really great   tomorrow  ill look forward to it  were getting together tomorrow  communications the key  the light at the end of the tunnel  all clear  well have a man stationed at the front and side doors and 2 in the parking lot  just give us a yell if anything arises  nothings gonna arise certainly not me not until tomorrow morning  im exhausted  dont let anyone near this door for any reason  shoot them if you have to  no problem sleep tight  sleep would be nice  but theres too much to do  the good news is my new friends will keep doakes away  the bad news is they make getting to jimenez difficult  but not impossible  fortunately a car isnt the only way to reach the everglades  and my new marinas only a 20minute walk  im on my way jimenez  dont decompose just yet  ill be against the current on the way back  with bagging cleanup and detour to the gulf stream  tight but i should be home by daybreak  its time to get you out of my life once and for all   you gotta talk to lundy  about what  get him to hold off on putting doakes on the news  maybe you should talk to lundy  youre one of us doakes is one of us   he deserves the benefit of the doubt  look  lieutenant i know hes your friend  and were all pretty fucked up about this   but it is lundys ballgame  but he listens to you   youre his right hand  right hand just say it  fuck the euphemisms and ok i may be sleeping with him  but it doesnt mean he tells me shit  or listens to me about anything so stop asking  youre sleeping with lundy  im sleeping at your place again tonight  just one more trip  ahead of schedule  thats right motherfucker its over  howd you find me  gps tap on your boat  jesus christ morgan  jesus fucking christ youre the bay harbor butcher   i really hate that name  jesus christ man   you said that  i knew there was something with you  but this shit  what can i say you were right about me  i never held it against you i dont now  my buddies thought i was crazy for becoming a cop  i had skills i could have written my own ticket  and lately i thought they might have been right but this  this makes it all worth it   im happy for you  shut the fuck up  lets get this over with  put them on  morgan youre done give it up  would you in my position  i wouldnt be in your position you sick fuck  you sure about that you might wanna chat with lundy  you shoot me wholl prove your innocence  maybe ill just kneecap you  alright nice and slow   back the fuck off morgan
