                 previously on dexter  tonights the night  and its going to happen again and again   has to happen  there he is hes the one  youre mine now so do exactly as i say  you better be a cop  no forensics  there is no blood near the body at all  its the weirdest thing you ever saw  ive never seen such clean dry neatlooking dead flesh  how is he doing how does the killer get rid of the blood  one of these days youre gonna tell me  i told you blood spatter doesnt take up all my time  how the hell was your date with rita last night  great  shes perfect because rita is  in her own way as damaged as me  open your eyes and look at what you did  please you have to understand  trust me i definitely understand  hello  what are you doing now  im just finishing up a little project but ill come by later   they found another hooker  une autre   thats the third one in five months  third you mean theres a  serial killer thats right  dex there are people out there who do really bad things  of course you have to learn how to spot them  but i can teach you  the killer flayed the skin the flesh completely off  why would he do that  hes experimenting  trying to find the right way  hes certainly raising the bar damn  this guy is good  the killer is an artist  you give me the fucking creeps you know that dexter  yeah i know sorry about that  but now we have a fourth body  and the cuts were different  and thats tellings a story  the ritual is changing  id like to check and see  if any refrigerated trucks  have been stolen in the last week or so  it just seems odd  your sister has this icetruck theory  and then here you are to back it up  shes good lieutenant you should give her a chance  i think this is a friendly message  hey want to play  and yes i want to play  i really really do  i dream  i dream im floating on the surface of my own life  watching it unfold observing it  im the outsider looking in  yeah man  you want to play man come on  in the water  look at them they can laugh and play  it comes so easily for them  even though im not one of them  even though sometimes i can really be a monster  today im just  a sea monster  soon enough ill have to go back to doing what i do  so i make a point of enjoying days like this when i have them  just a second  the icetruck killer left me a gruesome souvenir  explaining it could be kind of  awkward  hey  bagels brother let me in  could  it be more depressing in here  got anything to drink its hot as hell out there  oj  with ice  so how you doing  im fine  yeah things are fine  breakfast which i already had was fine but  you know me im always hungry  so whats up hotshot  all right get this  lieutenants looking for that refrigerated truck  in every swamp glade and chop shop from here to the keys  but the way i see it  that whackjob truck driver threw a severed head at your car  its not as if hes shy  you think hes hiding the truck in plain sight  wanting it to be found  i could answer that if laguerta didnt have me back with my hookers  looking for a witness  finding that truck is your golden ticket into homicide  tell me about it  just because laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time  doesnt mean you cant look for the truck  on my time  whats with these  ive got court  why is it we never talk brothersister stuff  our dad was a cop youre a cop i work for the cops  for us this is brothersister stuff  brings out your eyes  first he throws a severed head at me  then he leaves me these doll parts  like pieces of a puzzle  i like puzzles  but theres nothing more frustrating than putting a puzzle together and finding then  it still doesnt make sense  please state your name and occupation  my name is dexter morgan and im a forensics specialist  in bloodspatter analysis  for the miami metro police department  and how long have you been doing bloodspatter analysis  almost twelve years  youve been involved in quite a few cases then   give or take  no 2103  then its safe to say blood is your life  safe to say  unlike the other guys down at the station i love coming to court to rub shoulders  with the good people of the sunshine state  and sasquatch  in a courthouse everyones on their best behavior  like theyre being watched  and  they are  some people would look at this family  and see only tragedy and heartbreak  but i see so much more than that  ill do this okay  i see opportunity  alexander pryce finished his homework  kissed his mom went out for a jog  he told her hed be back in time to take out the trash cans  just  another night until  until the defendant not only struck him  with his car but fled the scene  leaving alexander pryce alone and dying for hours  before his body was found the next morning  from heinous to unspeakable  the people will prove that not only did mr chambers  strike and kill alexander pryce  but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol  happy birthday alex  thank you   rip right into it  what   yeah  hope its money  yeah you wish  surprise  thanks guys its like 80 degrees out  but next year at this time  were coming to visit you at harvard  its everything ive ever wanted for you alexander  thanks dad  all right enough corniness  i see their pain  on some level i even understand their pain  i just cant feel their pain  it just a matter of time before we see how far  matt chamberss crocodile tears will get him  but until then  a little of my favorite tropical fruit  the perfect driving food next to a pulledpork sandwich  also i can keep my energy up for the day job   ven conmigo    junto a mi corazn    y me quite la vida  si no tengo tu amor   detective   buena  buena  did we get an id  first on scene pulled the wallet  were still waiting  hello dex  her boss  lieutenant laguerta  in keeping with her total sense of entitlement  she has this attraction to me  and i thought i was creepy  given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter  distance had to be a 50 60foot drop  the eastbounds only 40 feet  its not high enough for this kind of damage so  best guess originating point is the westbound causeway  get me a team on the westbound causeway  shes good  angel look at this  i think theres something in his mouth  medic  its just a death rattle hes gonzo  you better check out my friend too  no telling what this guy might have had  this is what he had  call me crazy angel but i think this

pinot gris  before i knew it we were  stop that  you dont want to hear this do you  no  but if you two are getting serious id love to meet him  why dont you and sean the mechanic  join me and rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night  why  so you can tell me later hes not good enough for your little sister  dont  youre the one who was going on about brotherandsister stuff this morning  and that

job  lately the thing that surprises me most about rita  is how much i like being with her  but whenever that happens with a woman  when i feel comfortable with her it all goes wrong  thats why i

restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up is this the one you saw  i feel like a kid at his own surprise party  this is the same truck  its hard to say it all happened so fast  lets go on a nonforensicgeek limb here and say that it is  why is it still running  it keeps the back compartment refrigerated  dios mo  holy shit theyre fucking fingertips  clean slices no blood  my guess is he drained the body entirely before these cuts were made  howd he do that some kind of pump  no  i had forensics do a workup on our last victim  our guys old school  yeah he hoists the body up severs the jugular  the heart does all the work  its the most effective method really  fucking butcher  there are 206 bones in the human body  he could have left any one of them  but he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim  like hes leaving a trail of bread crumbs  who made the find  officer morgan  harrys daughter   must be in the genes her and her brother  this trucks a good get  its their first solid lead  i encourage all my officers to think outside the box  well nice work lieutenant  i got the deputymayor  congratulate morgan for me  another beautiful miami day   mutilated  corpses

gusto es mo patrn  police put your hands up  police put your hands up  get them down  put your fucking hands up put your hands up  is that necessary  its a dangerous world guerrero  yes and one cant be too careful detective  yes iive had alc  problems with alcohol in the past  i never tried to hide that  but you heard from my aa sponsor  i ive been sober for over a year now  look iim not disputing that that it was my car  that hit mr pryce  but  i reported it stolen hours before the accident  men like matt chambers know how to pull on the invisible mask  of sympathy  even empathy  and otherwise rightthinking people dont stand a chance  not guilty  matt chambers may have found a way to beat the system  but so have i  ricky where the fuck are you  fuck he saw me  please dont hurt me  the way we see it  youre in on the kill of ricky simmons but thats not enough for you  or for guerrero  ricky is dead  that saddens me  shut the fuck up  wait youre not implying  that ricky simmons was a cop are you  im truly disappointed  not only do i have a dead cop  someone broke in his house and shot his wife  word out in the world sergeant  simmonss wife was fucking around  maybe he tried to kill the bitch himself  and felt so bad about it he committed suicide  a cop murdersuicide  its a health crisis for you guys aint it  you think its a fucking coincidence your ass is in here  we got you on the causeway the morning ricky simmons died  bullshit  we dont deal in bullshit  we deal in good police work  and good science  you must have been a motherfucker at cats cradle  i never played it  okay kara simmons was shot while she was running  her phone call tells us that right  and she was running towards the back door there  she turns  the shooter sees her  shes shot high on the chest  it spins her around  spraying blood on the walls there and there  she loses her cellphone  she struggles with the coffee table  the couch and then she finally falls back  pop there  she never got this far  its not her blood  angel meet our shooter  dna of cervantes flesh in ricky simmons mouth  dna from a rogue drop of blood we found at the simmons house  tell me youre sure about this   that puts cervantes at both crime scenes  lets nail his coffin and ship it  hang on sergeant  we get him to roll over on guerrero  and we own them both  youre talking about throwing him a deal  and then what  he walks  if he does we pick him up on other charges  if he gets us guerrero its winwin  gets us guerrero we cant catch the guy  hes unfuckingtouchable  come on lieutenant  we already got a win  its not about your win  its about the big picture  ive seen this before  whenever a cop is killed its like everyones life  has been stopped in midsentence  davey sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop  davey sanchez was a son a husband and a father  davey sanchez was my partner  davey sanchez was my hero  that was great  what dad  ever since davey was killed my world feels out of control  how do you fix it  two ways i guess  honor daveys memory  and catch the bastard who did this to him  its not about vengeance  its not about retaliation  or balancing the books  its about something deep inside  my father had more than his share of pain  but he didnt deal with it the way most people do  happy hour now theres a misnomer  ill have what hes having  wise choice  you celebrating  something like that  hey have we met  i doubt it i just moved down here  i needed a new start  girlfriend or boyfriend  exwife  she said i drank too much  hence the ex part  fuck her  man she was all over me to change  like she never done anything wrong in her life  besides marrying me  we all make mistakes  unfortunately mine usually involve lawyers  god damn it  i thought i was the only one who hated the hurricanes  i take it you didnt grow up in miami  no ive had to move around some  say no more  but home is where my ass is  im getting mine out of town  enjoy miami  remember theres nothing a new city cant cure  you got that right  thanks buddy  next ones on me  you sure youre good to drive  been a lot worse  i sure hope he doesnt go out there and kill himself  that would betragic  matt chambers is accused of committing a crime in florida  he was arrested in florida  and hes being tried in florida  so the good people of florida  only went as far as validating their own assumptions  that matt chambers is a florida bad guy  nothing a new city cant cure  my father taught me one thing above all others  to be sure  and i am  matt chambers miami is your last stop  if god is in the details and if i believed in god  then hes in this room with me  i just wish hed brought an extension cord  its james  were gonna get the bastard who did this to you  this guy is just toying with us  and laguertas too fucking dumb to see it  yeah deb was saying that this psycho guy  cut off that chicks fingertips  man thats got to suck right  guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive   thats not his style  he usually leaves the killing to someone else  so how long have you two been going out  a couple weeks i guess  deb never mentioned how you met  well she brought her car into my shop and  you have your own place  no but i wish i did  some day huh  dex enough with the inquisition  no its all right  if i had a sister with legs like yours  id be checking out the dude she was seeing too  is this guy a keeper or what  come on ill get you another drink  are you guys good  yep  seems like a nice guy  they could barely keep their hands off each other  i can kill a man dismember his body  and be home in time for letterman  but knowing what to say when my girlfriends feeling insecure  im totally lost  off your ass cervantes  hands behind your back walk backwards and assume the position  step away  exit the cell  where are we going  the call came down  they want you moved to a more secure block  you think the call to take care of me came down from the warden  who the fuck do you think the warden listens to  get used to it  thats from mr guerrero   are you sleeping   are you sleeping   brother john   brother john   morning bells are ringing   morning bells are ringing   ding ding dong   ding ding dong  every time a woman tries to do this to me it  tickles  still its not entirely unpleasant  what  the kids  they sleep through thunderstorms  im sorry  tell me wh  i i cant do this  its okay  thats okay  im okay  we have an elephant in the room and its name is sex  tell me about it  as far as im concerned  it can just stay in the corner and mind its own damn business  its easier said than done  yeah  but it needs to be right  for both of us  or it wont be right for either of us  i dont want that do you  no  you know  i cant believe i found  the one good truly decent man left on the planet  was found dead in a basement hallway  of the miami metro jail  norberto cervantes was a known associate  of reputed drug lord carlos guerrero  speculation is that another inmate  is responsible for the mayhem here tonight  notice how the skin is gloving around the joints  and that is important because  a sure sign of postmortem severance meaning  the victim was already dead when she was  relieved of her fingertips  why the different nail polishes  what the hell is this guy thinking  hes thinking tag dexter youre it  i dont know do you have an id  shari taylor another hooker   at least hes consistent  yeah  killing young women who have to sell their bodies just to survive  or feed their kids  my sister puts up a front so the world wont see  how vulnerable she is  me i put up a front so the world wont see  how vulnerable im not  i dont care who these fingertips belong to  only what my new friend out there is trying to say  morgan the captain wants you  her  you wanted to see me sir  lieutenant laguerta has something she wants to tell you  officer morgan  youve shown tremendous initiative  these last few days  because of you we were able to track down that ice truck  and we now have an id on the latest victim  the captain believes you should be reassigned from vice to homicide  and i concur congratulations  youre a good cop  like your old man  thank you sir  thank you so much  you keep this up and i see a detective shield in your future  i wont let you down sir  i hope you know what youre doing  i promoted you didnt i  now find me this icetruck son of a bitch   okay  okay  y nina  y tu hija cmo estn  estn maravillosas  t sabes que ellas tambin te necesitan eh  angel vete a tu casa  okay  burning the oil  i clocked out  why are you going at this so hard  when someone comes after one of us he comes after all of us  i know that look maria  you got something to say just say it  i just got off the phone with the hospital  kara simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago  i got to be there  james she died  was cervantes right  was kara sleeping with someone other than ricky  was it you  what the fuck were you thinking  what the fuck business is it of yours  my cops my precinct my business  kara was gonna ask ricky for a divorce  as soon as he came off undercover she didnt want to  she didnt want to hurt him when he was on the case  if i go by the book i take you off the case  fuck the book  theres nobody in this building more motivated to get  revenge  justice  take point on guerrero  thanks  in slaughterhouses  they stun the animals before butchering them  its the humane thing to do  those animals  theyre the lucky ones  brother meet me at locos crab shack  totally important do not let me down deb  gone to rest his weary head  the good news is hell still be here  when i come back for our own personal happy hour  god these are so good  not as good as your good news  my little sisters all growedup and transferred to homicide  and the best part  laguerta had to say the actual words  i thought her head would explode  im really proud of you  you had my back the whole way and i appreciate it  i mean that  youre the best  and thats why i wanted to share this moment with you  so sean was busy  it turns out theres another woman  who  me  sean the mechanic is married  imagine me picking the wrong guy huh  and you and he are  so over  i dumped his married ass  i just wish i could get into a healthy relationship  like you and rita  without the drama and the tension and the uncertainty  yeah im a lucky guy  jesus dad its called being on time did you ever hear of it  i was having a bad day  the captain and i had a discussion  well maybe you sh  wait w what kind of bad day  its about the guy who killed davey isnt it  the judge said the bust wasnt righteous and let him walk  that guy kills a cop and nothing happens  thats not fair  lifes not fair dexter  cant anyone do anything  cant you do something  no not now  so what then  the world just keeps spinning out of control  no  the world can always be set right again  that guy kills a cop and nothing happens  not anymore  be back in a sec  im kind of running the gamut here emotionwise  nature calls  all the planning the making sure  does it go away because i have a chance  to rid the world of a cop killer and balance the books  do i just ignore  everything my father taught me about how to do this right  about how to stay safe so i can do it again  yep  i dont give a shit about your goddamn problems  i gave you a job you take care of it  what the fuck you looking at  happy birthday alex rip right into it  but next year at this time  its you  and you  thanks dad  all right enough corniness  we meet again  for the last time  i didnt do anyth anything  some people believe that  the problem is i dont  but its true  i was  i was set up  by whom  that  that family  they needed someone to blame its a natural thing to do when youre grieving  so then none of this is your fault  i swear  okay okay okay no  okay okay stop  all right  okay okay  it  it was me only it wasnt me  it was the booze  it takes me over  thats a point of view to which im not entirely unsympathetic  neither you nor i  is in complete control of our destinies  although at the moment  it would seem i have the upper hand  really im so sorry  youve done this too many times to be sorry  carlos guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world  thats his truth  my truth is  that world doesnt need me to balance its books  matt chambers welcome to your last change of address  youll like it here  you and your neighbors have so much in common  the worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle  is finding there are missing pieces  he came back and left nothing behind but a message   come find me  and i will  there are no secrets in life  just hidden truths  that lie beneath the surface
