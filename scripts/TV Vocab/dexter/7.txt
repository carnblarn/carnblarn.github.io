                dexter 01x07  previously on dexter  it is my new friend  when he broke into my apartment he took some time to get to know me   my life  my secrets  same as the others   no blood  somebody who was here last night saw something  they got a night watchman but we cant find him  its the guard  tucci i think hes alive  taking tucci over to county  rudy here is gonna put me back together again  yo pretty boy youre stealing my thunder  i dont know i just might have to fight you for this one  how about you focus on whether or not he was the man  you saw at the old hospital that night mr perry  it was difficult to tell it was dark  florida prisons kick free  i search for the ones who think they beat the system  like jeremy downs jeremy got off easy  to the coroner the knife strokes looked random  but i saw the work of a young virtuoso  are you gonna fuck me faggot  cause i killed the last guy who raped me  i understand now  jeremy didnt murder that boy four years ago  he was taking out the garbage  wait is that all  the fbi estimates that there are less than 50 serial killers  active in the united states today  we dont get together at conventions share trade secrets  or exchange christmas cards  but sometimes i wonder what its like for the others  the only sound i hear  the only sound in the entire world  is my heart beating  i swear to christ morgan after this case  im submitting your ass for psychiatric evaluation  im just retracing castoff patterns  directionality angles  can you tell us what happened here or not   its an execution  pretty unlikely victim  the kids an honor student editor of his school yearbook  its all in the knife work its skillful no wasted motion  the killer had experience  every stroke hit a major artery  or at least came close  are you getting a goddamn hardon there morgan  its trully horrific he was yearbook committee you said  i want your report on this tomorrow  i wish i could say sergeant doakes  is my biggest problem right now but hes not  ive seen these wounds before  youre drooling on laguertas couch   you pulling a midnight shift  lopez has the trots   why are you still here  why not  nothing at home except an empty fridge and an empty bed  if i wasnt married and 10 years younger  id still be in high school keep dreaming  wiseass  ive been chasing leads on the icetruck killer  pathetic long shots mostly  yeah what kind of leads  i looked at the research with mass murderers  its dumb shit that trips them up  son of sam got a parking ticket  outside his own crime scene  so you ran parking violations  at the crime scenes of our guy smart  yeah but none of the registered owners had criminal records  try moving violations  timothy mcveigh drove way too fast on the way out of town  neil perry  i know that name  yeah he came forward as a witness two weeks ago  when pieces of tony tucci were showing up around town  he rode through a stop sign two blocks  from  the third crime scene at the seven seas motel  why would a voluntary witness be  at two separate crime scenes  i dont know maybe he was chopping up hookers   holy mother of fuck is this him  lets find out  are you sure this is the right address  according to dmv this is where perry lives  with his seven inbred cousins by the look of it  something has got to be wrong with somebody that can live in a steel box  aluminum actually  nina and i had a deluxe multisectional   for real  it was our starter home  this is our car  one of the victims was seen getting  in a woodpaneled station wagon on the night of her death  lets take one step at a time lets find our guy  according to his files he works as a computer analyst for miami lake  look up slowly  all right take the front door  cover all the exits im going to the back  open up perry its the police  open up perry police  open up perry  open the door  hey angel i got him  police stop running perry  get the fuck down  fuck  i knew i recognized the knife work of the killer  jeremy downs  i had him he was mine  until i found out the boy jeremy killed raped him  he fucked me and i killed him  so i let jeremy go it seemed fair  but my random act of kindness was misguided  if i had followed my instincts  this boys highschool yearbook would still have an editor  captain matthews is coordinating the fdle  to launch a statewide manhunt  the task force will tear apart the house for any evidence  that links neil perry to the icetruck murders  we need proof this time people  tangible proof  what is it  they really found the icetruck killer  i did   yes yes  we will financially guarantee extradition from anywhere james  yeah im on it lieutenant ill run the task force  actually i need you and pullman to stay  with the knife victim in the alley   his parents are highprofile  whatever you need  angel you found perry you run the task force  contact the fugitives friends  family coworkers coke dealer   anybody  who might try to hide him  you want us to circulate his photo  in neighborhoods only  keep it away from the media  this case stays lowprofile  the last thing i need is another tony tucci on my hands   anything else lieutenant  yes   choose taskforce members who can  put their regular duties aside and bust ass  until  neil perrys apprehended   ok  ok  dominic  okay thats all thank you   do you really think this is the guy  its all lining up  i saw him dex  i chased him  debra morgan  get over here youre on the team  do you hear that im on the team  do you think we get hats  hardly looks a guy capable of terrorizing miami  a science camp maybe  im off  ill keep you in the loop  wheres my blood report sparky  im on it sergeant   how you doing mrs bennett  hey charlie  where are the kids  your husband swung by a few minutes ago he didnt tell you  i never seen cody light up like that before  big treat  the old man coming down  wait wait wait   paul  yeah he just picked up the kids  you gave my children to paul  are you stupid  i told the administrative office that  cody and astor are not to be released into his custody  well nobody told me  he just got out of fucking jail  everyone follow strict sterile protocol  there will be no contamination of my crime scene  bag anything that could be used to  murder or dispose of a human body  thats pretty much everything in here boss  except this can you say sick fuck  some might say that  to others cryptotaxidermy is a fine art  i got a mummified chupacabra at home  can i have permission to run masukas prints   as the icetruck killer  no need for that  ill give you some warm dna right now  god youre gross i didnt hear that  detective i found something  an archive of hidden files a lot of howto documents   draining blood from cattle wartime amputation techniques  butchering the human carcass  theres even an article about countries  that dont extradite to the us we got this fucker  we got jack shit morgan  everything in here is circumstantial  we need some hard evidence  im not done looking yet are you  the school had no right to release my children to paul   no they didnt  he lost his custody rights  right around the time my head hit the living room wall  i would think so  i should be out looking for my kids  rita the best thing you could do for the kids  is stay here in case he calls  what if he doesnt  what if he kidnapped them to get back at me  for putting him in jail  dexter i    hi  i got you  astor  mom look  its dad he came home  yeah what you think i was gonna  move to the moon  stop it just stop  do you know i called the police  why i told you i was taking them to the carnival   no you didnt  rita i called you at the hotel  they said you were on a break  so i left a message with the info and my cell number  uh hi how are you  im paul bennett father on parole  uh dexter morgan  uh i cant think of anything clever to say  paul this is unacceptable i have custody  you cant just take them without my permission  i came to see my babies  i missed them rita  i missed a lot of things  i should phone the station  call off the dogs  dexter look   my dads home  yeah i see that buddy  hey angel  youre the expert on manufactured living  this closet look a little small to you  a little  sweet  ive got newspaper articles  dismembered body found in a pool  icetruck killer appalls miami  this is a record of everything hes ever done  i got photos  those of his crimes  did we release those photos to the press   no  did he take them himself  he  had to   did we just hit the mother lode  no  we hit the motherfucking mother lode  the evidence just keeps piling up at the mobile home  i just authorized an excavation of the back patio  i think theres something buried there  what are we doing to find neil perry  i put his name in the automated system and notified the fbi  airports on alert   airports train stations bus lines  we should track his credit cards  already done  along with atms and bank accounts  i also put a tap on his home phone   seems you thought of everything  it seems that way   look maria   no need to apologize  i dont require your approval to do my job  i  know that  ive been kicking your ass cause i knew you had this in you  well thank you  for making me the woman i am today  i love you to everything  i love you to everything too  hes not gonna hit you anymore  he told me at the carnival  i made him promise  thank you baby  i havent had time to process as much as the kids  and paul was supposed to be locked up for another year  cody seems to be processing okay  codys too young  a dads just a concept to him not a person  but astor   she remembers what he put us through  well at least youre not married anymore  thats just it  technically we are  when paul went to prison  i started divorce proceedings  but he refused to sign the paperwork  as a power play  i dont think so  i think for all the darkness that haunts him  paul loves having a family  i think hes just afraid to let go  when did you first notice it  this darkness inside the guy you fell for  i always knew it was there  i guess i just didnt think i deserved better  till i met you  i have a dark side too  what i do  somehow i doubt that  you have a good heart dexter  youre not like paul you dont hurt people  innocent people  i dont hurt innocent people  hey dude the bowling alleys around the corner  hey im looking for jeremy downs  jeremy  he vacated the premises  focus  im trying to find jeremy  oh i get it  look man  im not really into that homo shit  but im kind of short on money for weed  so i guess ill do it

right  the icetruck killer drains the blood from his victims  freezes their bodies and only then severs their limbs  its clean and efficient  his psychological signature  neil perry on the other hand stuffs roadkill  yeah and turns it into fuckedup fantasy shit  but the fantasies are all wrong  the guy were looking for wouldnt turn  dead dirty things into living cartoons   hed find that pathetic  how do you know  because it is pathetic  deb trust me  neil perry is not a killer hes a dabbler hes a waste of time  if the guy were looking for took his early fantasies out on animals  hed bury them not display them  and what about an early human kill would he bury that too   sure probably  then turn around  you were saying  it looks like an adult female  any idea how long the bodys been down there  based on decomposition  shes been tits up for two maybe three years  well know more after the autopsy  what happened to the limbs did they rot off  no theyre clean cuts  but he didnt chop up the whole body  this could be  perrys first kill  like he was experimenting  youre the expert dex what do you think  sure sounds good  actually it sounds perfectly awful  for weeks ive felt like a student in a master class  is it really possible that the masters on the run  and even more tragic  does  he live in a doublewide  the gravitron goes so fast mom  my dad took me on it three times  wow

loner no pryors  his father split when he was 6  his mother was an alcoholic abusive  and possibly his first victim  roberta perry  dental records say she was the one under the patio  now neil kept her death quiet  by cashing her socialsecurity checks  for the last two years but  he did not kill her for the money  morgan  we think he wanted release  roberta perry ran her sons life  controlled him beat him as a kid  we think he dreamt about killing her for years  i just spoke with perrys cellphone provider  can they track his location  no signal  he probably turned off his phone  but according to records he used it  on some of the nights  the icetruck killer victims were taken  who did he call  voice mail mostly checking messages  verizon triangulated the location  all the calls came from the same place   a sixblock area on southwest 8th street  the tamiami trail  that strips full of notell motels  its like a happy hunting ground for hookers  theres a good chance thats where hes killing his victims  lets recanvass the area for leads  now that weve got a photo of this guy  maybe we can find somebody who actually saw him  lets go  youre starting to look like her  want to stop by your house check in with your family  id rather check in with your brother  his instincts are usually pretty good on this stuff  yeah not today hed just piss on our parade  he needs his day off  the first time i saw his work  i felt like a spanish explorer  landing of the shores of the new world  no blood in the victims  no spatter no stain  deb is wrong about him  its okay hell ive made

do you get to  make someone whole  i wouldnt know  its like living art  what you do  its funny you should say that because  before i turned to prosthetics i uh  studied the human form at the university of paris  sorbonne   really  yeah   have you had dinner yet  i would love to  i thought id come and show my support   bad timing  no no  have some champagne sergeant  see we got blogs we got podcasts  you know the information wont stop  it comes into your head and bleeds out your eyes  and its all crap  you know  see  you got to dare for greatness  these days to get peoples attention  did i get yours  this is worse than foreplay  why doesnt she ask him any questions  i have no idea what shes doing but my patience is wearing thin  i gave jeremy a chance and he blew it  is this one going to disappoint me too  thats an interesting interview technique  im tired of asking questions  youre getting off on this too fucking much   getting off on what  the game  im guessing thats why you didnt request a lawyer   so you can sit here  and say whatever shit comes into your head  meanwhile my ass is spreading like cheez whiz  waiting for you to figure out this isnt the fun part  what are you talking about  we got you dead to rights  but the good times wont start rolling till youre in a courtroom  with your own personal judge ito  and court tv carrying your  scaryass scowls  and crazyshit live  fascination with serial killers  is an american pastime  youve got groupie housewives  magazine profiles  maybe even a summer blockbuster movie  all waiting for you  but the feeding frenzy wont start  till you throw out the chum  until then im just gonna chill  youre right  yeah this isnt the fun part  the fun part  was hanging them like cattle  hanging who  the hookers right before i cut their throats  son of a bitch  i used gravity roots to hang them upside down  to drain the blood then  that shit is privileged the press never got ahold of that  id pour in liquid nitrogen to freeze the blood  before i cut them into nice and clean pieces  yes  see you got to understand i  i hate blood  and there it is   all the expectations i had  all the promises of greatness  wiped out  my circle of friends is down to one  how   what are you doing here are you a cop  the cameras are off i have one minute  tell me why i need to know   why what  dont  you killed again  i told you  i warned you   dont kill anyone who doesnt deserve to die  why did you do it  to feel something different  different than what  what do you normally feel  nothing  fucking nothing at all  i hate every fucking goddamn second of it  i cant stand it   living my life in my head  does killing make it better  no  worse  fucking worse than ever  put your hands on the table  do it  im a lot like you you know  yeah right  youre a killer  im empty  but i found a way to make it feel less bottomless   how  pretend  you pretend the feelings are there for the world  for the people around you  who knows maybe one day they will be  what the hell are you doing morgan  im scraping under the nails for blood almost done  get out  i want 10 more minutes with this piece of shit  before his lawyer shows  stand up  living my life in my head   i know exactly what jeremy means  at least i had someone to talk to   harry my foster father  he spent endless hours teaching me  how to survive  excuse me are you jeremy downs lawyer  yes i am im just heading over to see him  sooner would be better   seriously  thank you  my mom died when i was 16  cancer   and then it was just me my brother my dad   you have a brother  yeah dexter  he and my dad were really tight  you know they were always spending time together  i guess i was jealous  what you mean you werent daddys little girl  no i was kind of  he just took a special interest in dex you know  i think thats why i became a cop thats what he was  i thought maybe he would give me more attention or something  and did he  not really  but we had our moments  what about you howd you become  captain hook  well when i was little  my mom got in a car accident  she lost both her legs  its terrible  i remember when it happened  i just wanted to put her back together  you know like humptydumpty  just the pieces werent around  im going to miss my playmate  sure theres rita and the kids  but they dont know the real me  they can never know the real me  and now the father is back  things have changed  everything has changed  i always prided myself on being an outsider but now  i feel the need to connect with someone  i saw myself in jeremy  but instead of helping him like harry helped me  i gave him a piece of fortunecookie advice  that he never even heard  i failed him  he deserves better  and hell get it from now on  i guess i was wrong  jeremy did hear my advice  he killed someone who deserved to die  whats the status on perry  im having him transferred right now  the da wants to keep him at county  pending arraignment  maria  it was your decision making  that led to his capture and arrest  and you made all our lives easier  by getting the bastard to confess  im just doing my job  it feels good to be praising your police work  instead of your politics for a change  we need to make an official comment  dont worry ill keep it short  im just heading downstairs now for the press conference  the press conference is over  oh and uh dont worry i kept it short  you got to be fucking kidding me  that was my bust  this is my department  did you at least give me credit  yes i just gave it to you  havent you been listening  ever since harrys death ive been alone  but now  for the first time  i feel alone  how long you need with the prisoner  as long as i can get  jeremy is gone  and neil perry will soon vanish  into the catacombs of the system  i have so many questions for him  how did he discover my secrets  what was his message to me  hes been in my home  my photos  my life  he knows me  now i need to know him  to connect facetoface  before hes beyond my reach forever  hi  who the fuck are you
