                previously on dexter  two treasure hunters made a ghastly discovery today  when they stumbled on what appears to be  an underwater graveyard in a crevice off the coast of miami  agent lundy has requested the following officers for his joint task force  were a team and our first play is iding those bodies   im dexter morgan  i know who you are   hoping theyll talk to you  they always speak  you just got to ask the right question  harry was right  nothing stays buried perhaps not even me  should i be worried about pascal   and youre asking me because  because youve done the job  if shes out it means youre back in  i wont dignify rumors captain pascals fine  you need to wrap your wrists so you dont hurt yourself again  im sorry   well get you into a program   well get you the help you need  and i will be there for you   im dexter and im not sure what i am   everyone in that room has heard or lived   far worse than anything youve ever done   i doubt it  how full of shit are you  the mask is slipping  people who never mattered before are suddenly starting to matter  didnt your tour in the army include some special op in haiti   theres my sponsor  really where  dexter 02x04  see through synch  aa  just as the worst heat wave in years hits miami  the heat is also on me  its week three of the bay harbor butcher investigation  and superduper special agent lundy has yet to throw up his hands and say  wow this guys good  i give up  dexter please   you want me to help  no i just need you to move  im sorry its just you know my mothers coming today  i certainly do  i havent seen her in so long and i just want everything to be nice  we kind of ended things on bad terms  she and paul didnt get along  a lot of people and paul didnt get along  yeah but i  i think shes willing to put that behind us  she heard about pauls passing she wanted to come and be supportive  that sounds promising  absolutely  youll like her dexter shes great  shes a very strong woman  ill keep that in mind in case i have any heavy lifting to do  its too hot  i know honey hopefully itll cool down soon  did you sleep any better last night  more nightmares  what was it the big scary ghost or the alligator  no the bay harbor butcher   oh honey  he would never hurt you  but ill let you in on a secret  my sister debra who is a secret police agent ninja warrior  said he only kills bad people  and youre not a bad person are you  then youre quite safe  why dont you go get dressed  and i will make you some breakfast okay  it makes me so angry  that theres some monster out there scaring my son   i got to go to work  you know i hope they catch him today  and im not a violent person but i hope they hurt him  have a good day  make up your mind  in our most paranoid moments we fear that everyone is talking about us  thats become my reality  i cant hear what theyre saying but i know its not nice  alright lets get started  we have positive ids on all 18 of our complete bodies   organized crime  no connection to organized crime no mutual gang affiliation either  but all thirteen  were either tried for murder or at least suspected of murder   still you have your pattern  yes we just dont know what it means  i think we go out with this news immediately  what news  the news that our serial killer is only killing the dregs of society  that good moral people have nothing to fear  but captain thats all  this is the only lead we have we need to keep it tightly wrapped  last night an elderly man shot his son when he came home late  thought it was the bay harbor butcher  weve got a city in chaos here frank  i understand you wanting to reassure the people  good then were in agreement  dex i got this huge break in the bay harbor case  bullshit  i mean really  guys guys  you are not gonna  i refuse to believe that vince masuka is the man  who singlehandedly brings me down  i also know denial is the first stage of the grieving process  for those who learn theyre going to die  i need to find out what masuka knows  but ive got to be calm and centered  and focused  time for a visit to my sponsor  i need help  hi  hey just a minute   hope im not interrupting anything  no glad you called  just give me a minute  yeah have a look around  so i was gonna go and get some art supplies  is that alright do you want to come   yeah im just on my lunch break  excellent  why are they eating each other  dont know ask them  do you like the heat  not really im partial to airconditioning  i love it  it makes me feel like the whole world could explode at any moment  thats a pleasant thought   is there an art store near here  so you been using  using what  no drugs perfectly clean  look what we have here  jesus what are you  come on  are you gonna help or what  that was a little weird  so if youre perfectly clean whyd you call  i im under a lot of pressure at work  i was hoping you could maybe give me some quick tips  on how to deal with the urges  there are no quick tips  i see  someones gonna hear that theyll think its the wind  i thought we were getting art supplies  thats exactly what were doing  i work with found art  its more like stolen art  is this what a sponsor normally does on their 1st meeting  i dont know  ive never sponsored anyone before   really  yeah but dont worry  ive had all kinds of sponsors learned from the best  you do realize i work with the police department  if we get caught you can flash your badge  i dont have a badge i have a laminate  could we talk about why i called you  yeah sure  you want help  so tell me  why do you use  why  i dont know its just part of who i am  and who are you  im a  bad person  you havent got the first idea who you are have you  dexter meet dexter  im gonna help the two of you get to know each other  that doesnt really seem necessary  the first step to recovery is accepting who you are  i thought the 1st step was admitting you have a problem  and before you can accept who you are you have to know who you are  so thats our first job  youre going to tell me all your deepest darkest secrets  there is something off about him harry  you know why  alright look  it wouldnt hurt to have him tested would it  just a sec  i got to get back dead body  how many times have you used that one before  so the husbands name is barnes barnes   what do we have  hello dexter  gunshot victim alisha barnes 36  i heard there may be some big break in the bay harbor butcher case  could be  a neighbor heard her argue with her husband last night curtis barnes   masuka was pretty excited about it  husbands car is gone   nobody knows where he is  what did they find  can we concentrate on this case here please  sure  the killer was standing right about where you are sergeant doakes  two shots to the chest   i only see one hole in the chest  yes theyre that close together  very impressive shooting  it looks like the bullets took nearly identical exit paths  judging from the spray  and this was all topped off by a final shot to the head   she was mozambiqued  what  tripletapped  shit  im guessing this is curtis barnes  here he is in what looks like somalia afghanistan  a russian grenade a kurdish dagger  and tell me that shit wasnt stolen from saddams palace   what are you saying  im saying assholes special ops  theres no doubt about it  theyre generally known for settling their arguments so peaceably  dont get smug with me  sounds like were in your world james  yeah ill take lead on this one   pick a body  sir  i want you each to pick a body  this is where the case is going to be made we have 13 suspected murderers  and then we have these gentlemen  robert thatcher janitor for the school district  with no criminal record  marcus white  towtruck driver  no criminal record  and this  this is  oscar sota  whats his story  naval engineer for the port of miami  member of the stewardship council of st tarsicia catholic church  married loved respected  but he was found in a bag under the sea with 13 killers  why  answer that question then we really know something  i got him  oscar sota  why did the killer cut them up like this   ease of disposal  or for fun  you dont kill this many people because its a chore  you do it cause you like it  great  tomorrow  the barnes case  yeah that was a buddy from special ops he says curtis barnes is still in miami  the only part of that that i find surprising is that you have a buddy  it turns out barnes and i both were ranger rrd  regimental reconnaissance detachment  guys youre not supposed to know about who get in before everybody else   a brother in arms  something like that  my buddy put me in touch with a guy from curtis unit   hes willing to talk to me  good  i got your blood report its all pretty straightforward   id be careful though  why is that  the trajectory of the bullets are level exact same angle of origin  all 3 shots were fired in less than 1 sec  very impressive shooting  i need you to run some tests on this shirt   is there blood  no blood   im really the blood guy  its a smell  it smells like a woman  which part  who can identify this for me  you know thats really masukas area hes definitely your man  thanks  anything i can do to overburden masuka is to my advantage  trust me im not above sending pizzas and hookers  to his house in the middle of the night  well everythings unpacked  the back bedrooms small but its quieter  im just happy to be here thats all   youre always welcome  am i   i wasnt sure  of course you are  all these years without an invitation  i thought you didnt want to come   you and paul  nonsense  i wasnt gonna let that keep me away from my daughter and my grandchildren  but you did let it keep you away  lets not assign blame rita nothing good ever comes of that  well just have to make up for lost time thats all   hi  hey   dexter this is my mother  gail   so nice to meet you  nice to meet you too dexter  ive always been good with parents  the key is to simply think of them as aliens  from a distant universe  you have fibers and threads unknown to us  your ancient customs intrigue me  so dexter tell me everything there is to know about you  you have made me your sworn enemy  evil woman  i work in the forensics department for the miami metro pd  and im very fond of your daughter  good answer im also very fond of my daughter   you did a good job raising her  30 years as a schoolteacher  ive got a little experience with children  and i see a young man who is not eating  im not hungry  hes scared the butchers gonna get him  well remember he only gets bad people  i was bad today i threw a ball at tommy alvarez  well thats not too bad  and anyway the bay harbor butcher doesnt hurt kids   he doesnt  definitely not youre safe   they should hurry to catch him  they are working as hard as they can  if what ive heard is true  that he only goes after criminals i say leave him alone  hes got my seal of approval  perhaps i have misjudged you oh wise one  really  yeah sister spilled everything thinks he killed their parents  and made it look like a car accident the living trust was in his name  nice work  so whats it gonna be tonight chinese   italian  actually i have a  social appointment  you mean a date  i guess you could call it that  look at you  new in town and already hooking up  its an introduction arranged by a friend  one needs to get out and have a little fun on occasion  its something i strongly recommend for you as well   yeah with the hours we work  im serious  make time for it  itll help keep you better balanced  yes sir  are you okay  yeah its just   something at work  are you handling it okay  i ended up seeing my sponsor today at lunch  howd that go  not so great shes a little odd  plays a little loose with the 12 steps  that doesnt seem smart making up your own  maybe its cause its her first time being a sponsor  maybe you should try someone else  i just want to do whats best for my recovery  well maybe someone older more like you more   manly  yeah maybe  yeah   hey  hey  you remember me  yeah   youre the girl who doesnt like tape  debra actually  im gabriel   done for the night  yeah  any interest in grabbing a drink  usually a lady has to buy me dinner first  stop talking and get your pants off   are you always like this  no  no i havent even had sex since  since what  you all right   yeah just 1 sec  we dont have to do this you know  youre into the kinky stuff huh  no the last guy i had sex with tried to kill me  who is the bay harbor butcher  god  this obsession with him is relentless  just like deb and that damn treadmill  deb do you ever stop  dexter youre supposed to be at ritas  sorry  fuck  good morning  so that was a little weird last night  no yeah well  it was dark  my eyes hadnt adjusted all i could see were shadows  well lease put those shadows out of your mind  so whats this big break in the bay harbor butcher case   i keep hearing about  algae   algae  yeah  masuka found microscopic algae inside the garbage bags with the bodies  algae under the sea imagine that how does that help  cause there are over 100000 species all different  vince thinks itll help to find in which harbor the killer keeps his boat  hes got some marine biologists coming down to take a look  can you imagine something so little being the thing that breaks this case  i gotta go  ill see you at the station  it doesnt make sense  if theres algae on my victims  it would have to come from the ocean where i dumped them  obviously im missing something and i dont like that  mrs sota i understand you wanting to protect your husbands reputation  but i also have to tell you that your cooperation  can help us catch a serial killer   i am cooperating  you havent told me anything  cause theres nothing to tell  maria  you off to meet the man from curtis unit   yeah at the blue wing marina  you have backup  oh yeah all kinds of backup helicopters and shit  listen we got a missing murder suspect  this guys a friend of his im just gonna go talk to him  right  youre the lone holdout every other suspect has a criminal past  and not just any criminal past   they were all linked to murder  oscar never murdered anybody  then why was he killed  maybe he found out who the serial killer is  ok so your husband is an engineer and a secret crime fighter   are you through  youre gonna tell me what he did  oh no you are through  just what i needed  hello  you doakes  i am  and i guess youre not gonna tell me your name  im curtis barnes  i checked you out  we know a lot of the same people everyone says i can trust you  you can trust me  i just need 48 hours i got somebody to take me to cuba  but itll take a day to get the papers i need   so what are you asking  stall the investigation  let me ask you one question  yeah  did you kill your wife  yeah i killed alisha  turn around   turn the fuck around  no you are not arresting me   put the gun down and turn around  i dont think so  so howd your social appointment go last night  oh you know  i took your advice  my advice  to get out and have some fun got laid bigtime  well  i mean  i dont usually just go to the gym and pick up strangers  the gym  you have to save me here or im gonna go outside and shoot myself  the way youre going youd probably miss  thanks  my date  was horrible  i picked her up and i dont know miami of course so i got us completely lost  and shes chattered away the whole time about a yogi master i just have to meet  so by the time we got to restaurant i had tore my hair out   god im sorry  no it was good  it was a reminder that  i shouldnt be dating  of course you should be  it all comes down to simple mathematics  a really beautiful relationship  is a onceinalifetime thing  and ive already had mine  hey so i heard you found some algae that might help crack the big case   you heard right  what kind of algae  diatoms  eukaryotic algae  okay this is the first time i regret not being a bigger nerd   eukaryotic  ill let manny explain it to you  hes picking up the evidence tomorrow so he can study it in his own lab  you know marine biologists real prima donnas   any chance you could show me  masuka  up front  oh no its that crazy witch  what is this shit  i told you to find a smell  how fucking hard can that be   look i told you a smell isnt  it smells like another woman  i can smell it why cant you  this man is ruining my life  and you all go on like nothing is happening  come on  this is the kind of thing that makes me glad i have no feelings  like they always say never take your dirty laundry to work  we can stand here all day i dont give a fuck but youll put that gun down  now we were both rangers  that bond goes deep that doesnt mean anything to you  if you werent a ranger id have shot your ass by now  you killed your wife man  i didnt mean to  it happened man  you married  ever  once  she dropped your ass didnt she  what  got tired of you punching holes in the walls  waking up in the middle of the night screaming  was she always yelling you gotta get help  so she sends you to some doctor  but you dont go  cause you know theres no help for this kind of fucked up  and finally she cant take it anymore and she just says  adis  that sound about right  you got it wrong man  i left her  and why was that  cause i was afraid if i didnt id kill her  lets take the boat out   why would we want to do that man  wed get out of this heat for one  nice ocean breeze  maybe head toward cuba  come on just get me to within sight i could swim from there   once im there i could find the  youre wasting your time  youre going back to the station with me  no im not going to prison   i didnt mean to kill her  its the only way out of here  cant get you to reconsider  not a chance  well thats too bad  cause like i said   im not going to prison  put the fucking gun down curtis  dont make me do it  motherfucker  you gonna tell me how youre doing  im fine  come on dex open up  very fine  youre gonna have to do better than that  whats going on inside your head  what are you thinking  im afraid were  done  you and i  serious  youre breaking up with me  actually i dont think i want to answer any more questions  listen dexter whatever you think is right is wrong  he asks you a question i want you to think of your answer first  and then tell him the exact opposite okay  so lets just jump in all right  does it make you angry when your teachers tell you what to do  are you often bored  have you ever killed an animal  no never  i should get back to work  thanks  for everything  i heard about pascals little meltdown  shes been under a lot of stress   youre still doing it  whats that  sticking up for her  she is my superior  you know i may have misjudged you maria  maybe you are more than a political animal  you just might be a real cop  thats what ive been trying to tell you  youre back in charge of homicide  effective immediately  thank you  pascal just set women in the department back 20 years  its up to you to turn that around  there it is like a gigantic white whale  my moby dick  man this heat  i cant take it  ive got to get in my car before i fucking melt  which is exactly what needs to happen to my dearly departed friends   lila what are you doing here  hey dexter  you know ive been thinking about you breaking up with me  and well  i dont think its in your best interest  im tired  and hot and i have somewhere to be  i think you should give me another chance  theres nothing you can do to help me  its not even you its me  i am who i am and nobodys gonna change that  whatever you think you are  you dont have to be that  thats where youre wrong  stop judging yourself  there are no absolutes  no ones all good or evil  youre just gonna have to trust me on this  jesus dexter what are you so fucking scared of  you make yourself into a monster  so you no longer bear responsibility for what you do  i cant help it im a monster  of course i was gonna do that im a monster  its sad and its pathetic  and it breaks my heart  you dont think therere monsters in this world  you dont believe people are evil  ill show you evil  well you want me to open one  joseph cepeda  can i touch  this isnt exactly the reaction i was looking for  well ive never seen anything like this before  youre not disgusted  appalled horrified  its  incredible  but the person who did this  is a person just like me  like you  were all good dexter  and were all evil  i thought i closed the door to anyone ever seeing me for who i am  but this woman sees me  she doesnt know it  but shes looking behind the mask and shes not turning away  you really impressed me today  i dont know how you did it but great job   i just pretended to be someone else  well its working keep doing it  that doctor didnt even see the monster inside you  not monster its just son you know that you have these dark urges  anyway good job  and somehow even under all this pressure  shes able to make me feel okay about who i am and what i am  so   see you soon  im here for you   ive already told you everything  i know  im sorry  i came here to apologize   you were very rude  i was  it was shameful of me to disgrace the memory of your husband  thank you  its been a rough few days  not that you should care about that but  you know all these bodies   ive never seen anything like it  all murdered  cut into pieces  the only way i could make sense out of it  was to convince myself that they deserved it  they all needed to be bad people  but i should never have taken it out on you  can you feel it  the breeze  coming over the water  its nice  yeah  its finally cooling down  have a nice evening  wait  my husband  he kept guns hidden in the walls  i can show you  ive never broken into my own place of employment  but desperate times  garbagemen can be so careless  i say put this bay harbor butcher on the city payroll  give him a corner office a company car and all the ammunition he needs  at least somebody is doing something to clean up miami  which is more than i can say for those folks down at city hall   hey debra  hi  sorry about last night  dont be  maybe we can  do it again  how would you feel about a real date you know  with clothes on  where we actually talk and get to know each other  something like that  sounds good how about saturday  deal  pick you up at 800  and with us right now we have psychologist sandy ramos  to provide insight into the bay harbor butcher   evil serial killer or avenging force for good  this is the last time  bertrand  babe come on you dont mean that  no i do mean it i do   i cant see you anymore  wait no wait no  i dont understand maria  this this is done  shes gone its over with  we can finally be out in the open  just you and me okay  just like what we wanted  no bertrand stop  go back to esmee  so what this is how it is  you get your job back and now youre through with me  look dont play the victim you knew what this was from the beginning  you are one coldhearted bitch ill tell you that  no you dont get to tell me anything  i am not the piece of shit fucking another woman  behind his fiances back you try and judge me asshole  you dont know the first thing about me  yeah so i think i misjudged lila  are you sure  i mean shes unconventional but i think shes the best sponsor  for me  well if she can help keep you clean  whos this could it be robin hood  no im the butcher man  i made it for him i thought it might help with the nightmares  bet you didnt know you could fly  have i misjudged lila  i have no idea  i do know shes helping me look at myself in a different way   hes good that one  i know i got lucky  quite an actor  hes hiding something im sure of it  for example we find the genus nitzschia  and we know were talking about a freshwater marina  and the algae can tell us more  about what kind of pollutants are in the water  which would even further narrow  damn it  for the first time i feel the future might hold something different for me  its possible im just fooling myself  but im willing to take the risk  fucking garbagemen  broke the refrigeration unit it blew hot air all night  it turned the bodies into pink mush  how awful  completely ruined  you brought your marine biologist and everything  it made him vomit  anyway good thing the heat didnt affect the rocks  lundy had us store them separately   the rocks  yeah the algae we found on the rocks  the bay harbor butcher used them to weigh his bags down  we assume he picked them up where he docks his boat  but i thought the marine biologist came to examine the bodies  no no its all about the rocks baby  manny took him to his lab should have results in a week or so  that should help us narrow down what marina they came from  its an odd sensation to be experiencing  what might be called hope for the first time in my life  at the same time i suddenly find myself weighing the benefits  of electrocution versus lethal injection  but here i am
