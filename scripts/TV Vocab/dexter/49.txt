watched 67 people die  and at the moment of truth i looked into their eyes  and they knew and i knew  they got what they deserved  but what if thats not what happens  if you dont get what you deserve

artery  were looking at trinitys mo here  did he ever kill a married woman in a bathtub  first time for everything  unfortunately for dexter  were still waiting on the coroner to move the body  but overall lividity puts time of death  somewhere between      you okay  dexter came home to that  hes gonna need our support here  obviously  what do you want us to do with him  the first thing i want you to do  is pack up and get outta there   well  what  the fbis here trinitys their case  i already ceded jurisdiction  what are you looking at him for  its what i was saying on the way over  ritas one of ours shes family  we should be working on this for dexter  damn it angel its done  just do what i say  shes stressed we all are        my father harry taught me a few simple rules  never hurt an innocent and never make a scene  harry  where are you now when i really need you  when its my wife in the body bag  everybodys looking  and its the neighbor crying not me        sir  were ready for you  the first responders told me  when they went inside and found your wife  you said it was me  you sure  thats what was reported to me yeah  i dont know what i said  it could have been anything im very upset  of course you are who wouldnt be  mr morgan  before you came home and found your wife  where did you say you were again  dexter take off your clothes then were going home   i was asking him a question  he already said he came home  and he found her there  if you wanna help why dont you find trinity  or is doing something actually useful  not in your fucking job description   detective morgan  fbi  fucking bunch of idiots  stop  finish up here then take your brother home  you wanna talk to dexter schedule an appointment  ill do that  he can sleep on the floor  until we can bring his crib over from the house  itll be safest dont you think    i gotta tell you dexter  dont say things like it was me  people will misunderstand  in fact i dont understand  what did you even mean  dexter   this is dexter morgan  what is your emergency  i just got home and found my wife dead in the bathtub    what is this  the 911 call dexter made  listen   i just got home and found my wife dead in the bathtub  did you say your wife is dead  yes i did  she has an approximately  midway up her right thigh dissecting the femoral artery  right thats enough  he obviouslys in shock  midway up her right thigh  dissecting her femoral artery   habit of precision  his wife just died  hes submitting a lab report  seriously the next door neighbor  the guy with the you know forehead  he was more broken up about rita than dexter was   so  so its weird thats all  what are we working on here  not rita  its dexters 911 call  did you hear me or not  i said the case is with the fbi now  you should have taken her on a honeymoon  you were right about one thing  that neighbor elliot being all broken up about rita  im thinking now theres some things  i shouldnt have told dexter  what what shouldnt you have told him  about a significant exchange of saliva  i witnessed at thanksgiving  as in a kiss elliot and rita  dude was totally in love with her   and dexter knew  yeah  if id known she was gonna  i should have kept my big mouth shut      could someone get that deb    oh damn it  hello  dexter its maura   hello  im sorry if i woke you  but i have got two very excited kids here  and ritas not answering  yeah theres something you need to know  okay okay okay  but first somebody really wants to talk with you    dexter  hey cody you okay  weve been having the best day  i had cotton candy for breakfast  thats great astor here give me the phone  gimme gimme gimme  hey dexter can i talk to mom   not now  why not  shes uh  shes in the shower  wellcan you tell her we miss

and hes willing to see us right away  you willing to do that  im sorry for your loss  how does he do that  my sincere condolences  he sounds like he actually means it  thank you  would you like something to drink  coffee  water  no im fine    there are kleenexes here  if you need them  what we need to do now dexter  mmay i call you that  what we need to do now dexter  is make some very important decisions  about how your wife rita will be remembered  okay  we like to start with the obituary  its a good way to let people know about services  and where to send remembrances  but most importantly its a chance to express  your feelings about rita in your own words  scuse me  ill get you something for the paper  what else do you need  so this is how normal people do it  no hefty bags no diesel fumes    this is what she would have wanted  a grieving spouse  for once doing what a persons supposed to do  dexter morgan  rita  hi hi  sorry im late  thats no problem  there was traffic of course  i went to the wrong cafe  i went to the one in town  i didnt know there was anything even out this far  how did you find this place  i uh tracked it down  so i your sister  debras told me so much about you   uhoh  oh  nothing bad of course  she omitted the fact that im an ax murderer  no she said that you were a  bloodstain pattern analyst  which i have no clue what that is  believe me i barely do either  and i do it 40 hours a week  she seems nice your sister  you seem nice too  thank you    so um whats good here  i mean there must be something special  to bring you all the way out

tell  no i mean you how are you holding up  oh  fine  not used to having to be the strong one you know  its always been dexter  and now hes the strong one  to me its always seemed the other way around

did you know rita  i dont know you know we were neighbors  yeah i just couldnt help but notice  how torn up you were about her the other night  she was a friend you know it was upsetting  a friend  i uh was told she might have been more   christ  all right look i dont know what youve heard  but just so you understand the actual facts  all rita and i ever did was kissonce  that was it it was nothing  i mean her husband was never around  anyway  dexter found out about the indiscretion and uh  came over and punched me out  hmm    dexter   shh hes sleeping  brought some dresses for you to look at  where are astor and cody  at a hotel with their grandparents  howd it go talking with them  astors upset  they got me a hat  shell be okay  i dont see how  her mothers dead because of me  no shes not  shes dead because of trinity  i know you keep blaming yourself but you cant  theres nothing you could have done differently  i could have killed arthur mitchell  the first chance i got  you loved rita  you never would have let anything hurt her  she was lucky to have you  she told me that all the time  how lucky she felt to have found you  i was wondering what you were doing  sitting here by yourself for so long  now i see  i paid her to say that  you did  no i wasjust kidding  me too  so what does a blood spatter analyst do anyway  scuse me  is this yours   whats the deal here  i have to go  uh is everything okay  its a stomach bug its going around the station  im really sorry  it was nice meeting you   lucky to have me  i wouldnt say so  she trusted me and now shes dead  like your sister says im toxic  youd all be better off without me  delete the past leave nothing behind  youre up early  what are you doing over there thats so important  getting rid of every trace of me  nothing dexter  look i know this is tough to talk about but  the funerals tomorrow  and theres still a lot of stuff you have to do  like sign the coroners release  i need to grab my tools  and go over the guest list one more time   and torch the container  and the eulogy dexter  i cant do that for you  that really has to come from you  i need to top off my boat im low on fuel  yeah  and the fbi interview  or thedebriefing  or whatever theyre calling it thats really important  theyre total dicks for wanting to do it today  but maybe youre better off  just going in there and getting it over with  you sure you dont want me to come with you  no im fine  all right im off  ive been thinking about harrison  how he needs his mother  someone decent in his life  youve done everything for me  not just now my whole life  but  i need to ask you this one more favor  for that person to be you  that you  love him  as if he were your own  he is my own  and he has me in his life  of course he does  but more importantly he has you  youre decent and good  im not  you are  you are    whats her mood  how would i know  i dont know theres this rumor floating around  the two of you are married  look i just need to talk to her about something  i was wondering if this was a good time  just remember  shes the boss    no no further comment  serial killer murders cops wife  the press wont let up they want all the gory details   so what do you tell them  same thing i told you  its not our case  so what can i do for you  theres uh something i think you should know  having to do with rita  okay   and elliot the nextdoor neighbor  i was at the house with debra   detective morgan cleaning up  and this elliot and i struck up a conversation  turns out he and rita had like a  minifling  whats that meanexactly   wwell nothing really happened  but apparently dexter found out about it  why are you telling me this  what are you implying  im not implying anything  and what are you doing interviewing witnesses  i wasnt interviewing i was there  what cleaning  please  look if this were anyone but dexter  wed at least be thinking like detectives  which means what what do you always say  when the wife is dead  the husband did it    laguerta  umhang on for a second  i need to take this  well finish later  okay can you repeat that    yeah  i just got a call from the fbi  about your brothers

fine with deb  way better off without me i think we agree about that  i was never really honest with you  im a serial killer thats what i am  i know i led you to believe im a human being  but im not  thats a lie  there are only a few things you really need  once you decide to move on  what youll require wherever you land  a fine suit of clothing  the tools of your trade  and some token of your past  a reminder of who you really are  everything else  you just dont need  so where are you harry  speak now or forever hold your peace          ive disappeared so many people  my turn now to disappear myself      fucking fbi    damn it dexter dont do this      the sea breeze has always brought me clarity  its hard to get enough oxygen on land  its hard tobreathe            hey you  heyyou

so youre not talking to me now  is that it  i have been trying to talk to you  youre right you have  i just need you to understand  so tell me  i could have fought for this case but  part of me didnt want to  ritadied  she died and it scared me  weve been married what ten hours  dexter was the witness at our ceremony  for all i know  he was there with us while she was  being i know  well i didnt want to be reminded of that  i didnt want to investigate  i just wanted  i just wanted it to be our wedding day  oh  i dont like it angel  i dont like the way this makes me feel  i dont know what to do with any of it   maria    what  no one does  whats more important than his own wifes funeral  people are getting restless  thank you for reporting in with the obvious quinn  like im such a moron that its lost on me  you ever given a eulogy  no  well i cant do it  and those agents those vultures  are just waiting for him  look  theres something you should probably know  what  its not exactly an easy thing to say  the nextdoor neighbor elliot i spoke to him the other day   what the fuck  i know i shouldnt have  she had a big heart  big enough for both of us  had to be  i wasnt even human  when we first met  i never expected that to change  she reached out and found something  i didnt even know was there  she never hurt anybody  she was innocent  and she died a brutal death and  and i cant  fix it  but i know i have to try  here in miami with the people who knew her  and who who  who cared about her  and who loved her  like i did
