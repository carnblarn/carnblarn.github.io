                previously on dexter  i just got off the phone with the sheriffs department  theyve confirmed their skinning victim is related to ours  that gives us three victims  ive got unis bringing in a 15yearold kid named wendell owens  he was freebos doorman  if things get really bad you use that card and call me okay  you think i cut this kid loose to make you look bad  im not sure anymore  partner  you know a joey quinn  cooperation with ia has its upside  yuki thats not gonna happen  ramons obsessed  hes not going to stop looking for oscars  killer until it takes him all the way down  is there a problem here  yeah sergeant  your people dont know what the fuck theyre doing    where ya been dexter  how are you camilla  ah ive been better  are you uh looking for anything special tonight  might be more than an hour  take a pass  sergeant  anton open up its me  hi  hi  the chicky hines conviction  my people have come across evidence that could get the case reopened  prado know youre coming to me with this  dont you see what happened today  i gave you the chance to avenge two women whom the system failed  and just like i hoped you seized that opportunity  i see who you are i am with you  behind you  i respect you  hes tired keep on reeling  you got him  here he comes come here  come here  oh yeah  oh shit  ah ah  ahah  go ahead  thats gonna be some mighty fine eatin  hey man on the grill with syls mango and lime salsa  our house tomorrow night  check with the little woman  whos getting bigger as we speak  i could get used to the simple joys of male bonding  hey how bout a brewski  okay  ah that looks good  so dex  ahh  what was it like man  in bimini  flat mostly lots of mangroves  talking about ethan turner  what about him  what did it feel like to uh  take him out hmm  to end his life  so much for the simple joys of male bonding  like i could explain or miguel could understand  you put people on death row  you must know what its like  oh no  but theres like an ocean of bureaucracy of briefs and  appeals between me and that bad guy taking his last breath  im asking you what did it feel like to use your hands to  to make this a better place  it feltright  felt like justice  ive got like  five floors of prosecutors and the whole police  department at my fingertips and you did what i couldnt  you came through for me dex  i been sleepin like a baby ever since  it was hot today huh  like i said the other night i know you dexter  i see who you are  were likeminded hmm  together we can make a difference  we  miguel my amigo claims to know me  on some level i suppose maybe thats true  who are you kidding  he knows about freebo  he detailed me to the ethan turner kill  hes seen me with blood on my hands and hasnt blinked  miguels got no clue whats really going on inside you  the urge the ritual  miguel has really gone out of his way to understand who i am  which is more than you ever did  well i understood  i just couldnt accept it  and miguel wont either  you didnt want me to have any friends  you think miguels a pal  your wingman  you might wanna put that notion to the test  see how likeminded you and miguel really are  every time you let someone get close it ends badly  i do need to consider my spotty record connecting with others  but miguels not going away  i need to make him understand the risks  when he does hell wanna rethink the likeminded thing  just because he can gut a fish  doesnt qualify him to hang with me while i  do what i do best  you need a jump i have cables  skinner struck again  superhard this time  the victims name was wendell owen  he was 15 years old  its more collateral damage in our search for fucking freebo  wendell owens  i brought him in for questioning the other day  i thought i remembered hearing his name somewhere  he might have been mixed up with some lowlifes  but wendell was a pretty decent kid  go do your thing i just need a minute  bodys still warm  putting time of death about three hours ago  unlike the two previous victims  this one died from the skinning process itself  jesus christ  freebos probably in another galaxy and the skinner doesnt even know it  meanwhile hes stepping up his game  maybe we let the press know freebo got outta dodge  might get this guy to put down his ginzu knife  or hell keep looking take his horror show on the road  become somebody elses nightmare  no i wanna nail whoevers doing this  hes definitely not learning to do this on the fly  hes had plenty of practice  you run this through the national database see if a similar mo  comes up anywhere else  what i need to find right now is a target to present  to miguel with a high degree of difficulty and jeopardy  so that he truly understands that hes in way over his head  dex  i have a question  its serious  i cant ask any of the other cops  im all yours  its about the skinner  his last two victims  wendell and javier  they were both killed after i was done questioning them  do you think the skinners  drafting off my investigation  i dont know anythings possible  because im freaking out  that whoevers looking for freebo  is using me to attract him  who else knows you brought wendell in  his mom um  all the cops in the station  anton ramon prado  miguels brother  the law and order hard ass sheriff  whos been obsessed about finding freebo  for killing his little brother  theres your motive  do we seriously think that ramon a fellow cop  could do something this sick  like a career in law enforcement  precludes violent behavior  can you imagine the shit storm this is gonna create  if im wrong  itll create a worse shit storm if youre right  hey keep me in the loop  yeah  ramons got anger issues i dont want you getting hurt  aw you do care about me  wait till you see the wine cellar at the forge  it is legendary  they even have a bottle  of chateau dyquem belonged to thomas jefferson  im kind of a cuba libre kinda girl myself  ellen its me nicely done  handing miguel prado his head on a pike today  make the hines motion stick he could be disbarred  bravissimo  i was gonna talk to you about this  if and when my motions upheld  how bout we talk about it now  okay  miguels been playing fast and loose for a long time  with legal ethics  the chicky hines case is just one example  on a very long list of prosecutorial misconduct  i came to you with information to help your client  not for you to trump up some witch hunt  against my friend and colleague  you cant possibly believe hes either of those things  if you really knew miguel  believe me i know miguel  i will explain everything over dinner  no thanks  im not feeling especially social right now  i hope im not interrupting  no im alone come on in  taking the night off  so umbeer  sure  pot  fuck you  sounded kind of upset on the phone  im kind of upset in person too  you didnt talk to anyone  about me bringing wendell in for questioning  no i dont talk to anybody about anything  i try to keep the whole ci thing under wraps you know  then how the hell did it get out  well its a pretty safe bet wendell didnt tell anybody  you should have seen what this sicko did to him  im glad i didnt  what would make anyone go that hard  on some street kid for christs sakes  theres this guy im lookin at  hes a cop who had a beef with freebo  he saw me in the station when i was questioning wendell  wouldnt be the first time the boys in blue  handled their own business right  i cant rule out that i put wendell in the crosshairs  he trusted me enough to cooperate and  look what happened to him  hey look  even if youre right  you couldnt have known right  dont beat yourself up  its what i do best huh  i should go  all right  hey um  hey look um  that girl from the other night was  was nothing serious  uh wellits none of my business anyway  yeah right  jenna kendrick  one of the first crime scenes i worked blood spatter  this is somebodys daughter  and that was done to her by this animal  clemson galt  aryan affiliated  took a claw hammer to her for getting pregnant  he was arrested for murder  even confessed to his cellmate  he called it hammer time  they get a conviction  galts aryan affiliates either got witnesses to recant  or made them disappear  verdict came back not guilty  thatthat type of stuff happens way too often  galts doing 15 to 20 for armed robbery  in a supermax upstate  well thats something at least  get him off the streets  only hes still running things from his prison cell  the wife and three kids of an aryan defector  killed with a claw hammer  while youre sleeping like a baby  this is whos keeping me up nights  justice comes at a price  one that miguel is about to discover he cant afford  this asshole doesnt deserve to breathe okay  youre not gonna get any argument with me about that  but hes in custody  in a supermax no less  thats always been the problem  youre the big deal law enforcement guy  i bet you could get us access  thatthats beyond dangerous dexter  thats crazy  i knew if i appealed to reason  miguel would eventually understand the downside  nenever mind that my fingerprints  will be all over this  reason leads to selfpreservation  a potent force  we both would be seriously exposed here  i just need to sit back  hell see the pros are heavily outweighed by the cons  and well be back to mojitos and barbecues  yeah when you get right down to it  i guess ethan turner was an accident of opportunity  a onceinalifetime thing  what about freebo  another accident of opportunity  well that situation just sort ofunfolded  youre right  we both have too much to lose  hey we took out the garbagetwice  we should quit while were ahead  no  i owe you this one dexter  you stuck your neck out for me twice now  no you dont owe me  fair is fair  and i wont let you down  but we need to come up with a real plan  againwe  miguel surprised me last night  i expected him to say no and he gave me a definite maybe instead  no doughnuts today  not today vince  talk about your passive aggressive  clemson galt has been on my top ten list for years  and miguel could be a big help  but the goal here isnt to satisfy my need  its to get miguel to find some other hobby  dexter got a minute  whos sick  uh remember camilla from records  shes in the hospital  its not looking good so i got everyone to sign  camillas sick  sorry i thought you knew  lung cancer its terminal  just like gene  camillas husband  my folks used to play cards with them when deb and i were growing up  he died just last year lung cancer too  smokers  ah chimneys  life catches up  yeah  so does death  its a shame shes a good person  it sounds like she was a friend  a good friend  those are in short supply these days  camillas at good samaritan  you could drop that off let her know shes in our prayers  ill do that  thanks  detective gianna sergeant batista miamimetro homicide  how can i help you sergeant  i was uh wondering detective  maybe we could  see each other  asas in aa date  well yeah  you could call it that  look um sergeant letlets be clear  cause being clear will save us both a lot of agita  hey  i uh  i dont date ever  do you eatever  sometimes  good nutritions important  ill tell you what sergeant  i get hungry enough i will call you  angel  what  can i throw something at you that might sound a little crazy  crazy from you  ramon prado  what about him  do we like him for the skinner  okay thats not a little crazy  he has access to all of our records  so he knows exactly who ive been talking to  and weve all seen him up close this is not a stable guy  hes a fucking whack job  i looked into his work schedule  he was off duty when the last two murders went down  you seriously wanna look at ramon prado for multiple homicide  if only to rule him out  not only have we not found the perp that killed miguel prados  little brother now you wanna investigate his other brother for murder  in a nutshell  cant ignore something just cause its messy  if im right this is huge  and if youre wrong  everyone involved will be shitting   blood due to acts id rather not describe  thanks for that sarge  ive got a gut feeling  you uh wanna go to the lieutenant with this  i cant go to laguerta with this  you follow up  off the grid and its on you  thank you sarge  ramons off duty tonight and tomorrow  ill set up on him ill see what shakes loose  if you need company  ive got it covered  and try to be discreet will you  for a change  yeah  dexter  you came  i also brought you these  but it looks like somebody beat me to it  that new mom in maternity donated them to terminal care  talk about irony huh  you know dexter my whole life ive been searching for  the meaning of life  the perfect  key lime pie  and what do i get when im about to croak  fucking pie crust reddi wip and green jello  ill see what i can do about finding you the perfect key lime pie  youd better do it fast  next thing to go is the appetite  gene always had this thing about lighting my cigarette  and hed pass it to me  before he lit his own  sweet sweet man  then it all caught up to him  i watched him wither to a skeleton  my 6 tall 200pound husband shitting all over himself  his last breath was a mercy  dying i can do  hell im doing it  the pain sure is a bear though  how bad  the worst part of the whole damn thing  not losing my life  my time on this earth  is losing mymy  dignity  that fish was great  you dont think miguel overcooked it  a bit but the mango salsa saved the day  thank you  so do you like what you do  i mean real estate  i cant imagine doing anything else  i decided that losing my job at the   motel is not a bad thing but a good thing  so im looking around  well with your people skills youd be great at real estate  you think  how bout you start work tomorrow  imim sorry what  i need an assistant  having someone i can trust is everything  salud  listen ive been giving a lot of thought to this clemson galt thing  good  digame  what if we were to travel upstate and arrange an interview with him  about  a career criminal with a record like his  hes gotta be an encyclopedia of intel on tons of other cases  we would just need to get galt alone long enough  to make it look like another prisoner did the deed  last week  an inmate is found in a prison hallway drowned in a bucket of water  this stuff happens all day long in places like that  an inmate is found dead in custody dexter  be a lot of inquiries and investigations  you got the bleeding hearts comin outta  the woodwork whining about prison reform  ha it doesnt sound like much of a plan  that is the plan  so that miguel finally includes himself out  but um  im in the middle of trying a racketeering case right now  money laundering  the aryans theyre masters at moving cash around  i subpoena galt as an expert witness  corrections transports him down here to testify  then galt is within our reach hmm  and on my turf  guessing it would take a long time to set something like that up  it would  but ive already issued the subpoena  galtll be here tomorrow night  onlyhes gonna be a noshow on the witness stand the next morning  swing by the courthouse tomorrow ill walk you through all the details  say thank you dexter  miguel seems to have way more aptitude  and appetite for this than i ever imagined  just calling to check in  just having a looksee in ramon prados car  deb you really need to  relax  hes scarfing down his second plate of  arroz con pollo at a restaurant up the block  hes got a wife and kids at home got the night off  so why is he eating alone  well maybe the wifes arroz con pollo isnt pollo enough  you find anything interesting  a set of german steel filet knives a couple of straight razors  and like 12 pounds of human skin  just be careful out there will you  yes sir  debs got her mission  ive got mine  hey i can get out and give you a great  big hug so everyone can see what good friends we are  or you can talk to me  you know after 12 hours on surveillance detail  how bout you blow me instead  ive been given the directive to either  step up my investigation of quinn or close it  because you havent found dick  if you werent such a fuckwad  id almost feel sorry for you for working for ia  where careers go to die  you need to get next to quinn be his goto girl  youll be wearing a wire  are you on crack  how many times have i told you to eat shit  what the fuck makes you think im suddenly willing to play now  because if you dont  ill put the word out that youve been cooperating all along  everyonell think youre a rat anyway  hard to believe even you would sink that low  so that door right over there hmm  check this out  thats supposed to be kept locked and it never is  the smokers use it as a shortcut to get outside  shortcut to a shorter life  you know statistically most escapes happen out of a courthouse  the securitys a little bit more lax  the defendant is wearing a suit and a tie  it makes it easy for him to just walk away  easier for us to cover our tracks  that too  must be good to be you  sometimes  real reason shes blindfolded so she doesnt have to watch  everything she stands for get pissed on by someone like ellen wolf  you know  she had this client once who threw a  fiveyearold into an industrial washer for talking dirty  she got him off with six months in a mental hospital  diminished fucking capacity  hey  she probably got paid more that than you took home in a year  and i gotta tell you im very disappointed with your boss over there  i never thought that she of all people  would hurt me like this and throw in with these fucking bottomfeeders  my dad used to say be careful what you think you know about someone  youre probably wrong  smart man  well sometimes  maria  i appreciate your um cooperation in the deposition  ive never had a problem telling the truth  weve got uh more than enough to get the hines conviction set aside  and youve set the stage for your smear campaign against a standup guy  nice  you know you ever wanna hear the unexpurgated version of your guy  come find me okay  looks like a church  yeah  the holding cell is through that door  connects to a hallway then goes out to a parking garage  on your right theres gonna be an emergency exit  and that deadbolt is gonna be taped  open  why risk it all  your career reputation freedom  you could just walk away  you didnt walk away from ethan turner  because you understand dexter that were living in  were living in crucial times  crucial times that demand extraordinary measures  miguels convinced himself he wants this  kill tonight for lofty and noble reasons  im not quite as highminded  you didnt answer my question  asshole drunk dad  maybe im still trying to clean up the mess  that i couldnt when i was a kid i dont know  come on ill uh show you where youre gonna be hooking up with galt  morgan whats the hurry  you meeting someone  more like avoiding someone  hey this is me not telling you im tailing ramon prado again tonight  well this is me not hearing a word youre saying  im also unofficially and off the record  telling you to be smart and watch your ass  scuse me officer  sergeant how can i help you  i was just uh released for this legal thing  you were arrested  and released totally victimless  only i live like a million miles away from here  and i really need a ride  how bout the bus  how bout you take me home and i think   of some victimless way of saying thank you  ill have dispatch call you a cab  just like that  just like that  agent batista  sergeant barbara gianna here  so happens uhim hungry  hungry enough to to see if you are too  are you asking me out on a date detective  i dont date sergeant ever  marinos trattoria 730  arent you gonna ask me if i really turned over a new leaf  it could be im just not partial to redheads  i have no idea what youre talking about detective  ill see you at 730  delivered fresh daily from a little bakery down in key largo  supposed to be the best in the keys  well its not  pardon my bluntness but  this pie is green  means they used food coloring  something purists frown on  which id be doing right now except even my face hurts  the other thing they fucked up this wasnt made with condensed milk  no its fresh and organic  only they didnt have fresh milk in the keys back in the day  here comes miss morphy  bringer of bad dreams and less pain  dexter  if youre as serious about key lime pie as i am  you can do better  tonights the night but it feels different  i wont be alone  uncharted territory for me not without risk  and strangely exhilarating  so what do you think  best pizza night ever  no i meant about syls job offer  if real estates something youre interested in  i think you should go for it  and syls great at what she does  in a market this bad shes still always closing  and i could learn a lot i just  but  well what if i  see a side to her that i dont like  i guess thats the risk you run   when you go into business with somebody  especially a friend  makes things more complicated no doubt about it  still  without my friend syl i wouldnt have this opportunity  so i think im gonna take the risk and jump in   with both feet and see if this new thing calls to me  its getting late  you dont wanna stay  miguel and i have a early morning run  i can sleep in longer if i stay at my place  dont be surprised if hes a noshow  what makes you say that  hes been a complete wreck lately  not sleeping terrible mood  i mean syl thinks somethings really bothering him  i saw him today he seemed fine  well you may be his buddy but youre not his wife  and besides its not like you can hide anything from your partner  so true  why would you want to  looks like miguels got a bad case of nerves about tonight  he isnt sleeping like a baby anymore  if youre gonna bail of of this now would be a good time  what the hell are you dressed like that for  i figured the more the merrier  why dont we swing by and pick up rita and the kids  bring them along too  what makes you think you can count on miguel  hes just a little jumpy hes new at this  mark my words dex  hell give you up in a heartbeat to save his own ass  this is not a guy who wants to spend the rest of his life in a cage  just one more thing miguel and i have in common  you dont know what youre getting into  youve never had to rely on anyone else before dexter  because you taught me loneliness as an art form  but guess what  i finally have a life with a family and now a friend  who i trust  we only see two things in people  what we wanna see and what they wanna show us  you dont know miguel any more than he knows you  you arent seriously gonna lecture me on   relationships after the debris field you left behind  no matter how close two people are an infinite distance separates them  look at you and me  mind if i get a picture with you jefe

prado  you remember him  he really came through tonight  in a big way  i never had a partner before  i had my doubts initially but everything worked out  but this part the ritual  the connection and certainty  followed by that pristine silence  is for me  and me alone  miguel will be disappointed  ill explain to him i took galt straight to the cemetery  and dumped him in a grave after the screwup at the courthouse  truth is  im not ready to share this part of me with anyone else just yet  present company excepted  im not sure i ever will be ready  even if miguel senses my deception  hell forgive me this one small untruth  dexter  how can i be so sure  because after tonight  i can honestly say i know who miguel prado really is  my first good friend  and those are in short supply these days
