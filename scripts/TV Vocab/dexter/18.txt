                dexter 02x06  previously on dexter  we have to catch them in the act at the shipyard  hes gonna find out and then hes gonna kill me  harry knew my mother  why would rita print out narcotics anonymous literature  if pauls dead  because recently i entered the program  how many fucking times do i have to tell you that im fine  its my department  i need to know that you are fit for duty thats my job  i always eat lunch at 100  youll learn that about me why dont you sit down  youre very fidgety anyone ever tell you that  my father  you applying for the job  well you said youd call  where are you and when are you coming back  tomorrow morning  promise me to stop by the house  see you   is she ok with you doing this  i didnt tell her  i dont care what you did  im no longer sure who made me what i am  funny thing is ive met someone who doesnt care   we need to talk about coral cove  what about coral cove  the algae on the rocks sent us there  if i were you id consider moving your boat   security out there sucks  when im back ill hit the marina  and make sure theres no blood traces on my boat  it isnt a commercial marina  but i can see the upkeep on this place is dismal  thats why im gonna order  on this marina and the two others  dexter 02x06  dexlies and videotape   theres another shipment coming in tomorrow  cocaine  how much   can you get your hands on some  that wasnt part of our agreement  we need hard evidence otherwise its just your word against estradas  ill protect you  i promise  you better  do you meet me later  laura the tapes still rolling  very convincing  what was that  laura the tapes still rolling  damn it  my mother confidential informant  and mumbler  whatever sweet nothings she had to whisper  i probably dont want to hear  it seems that my foster father and my biological mother were having an affair  its bad enough i cant shake the visual but the questions  did he blame himself for her death is that why he took me in  did he love her  or was he just using her  was he using me  i always thought harrys code was onthespot creative problemsolving  but maybe he planned for me to settle the score all along  its times like this i wish i really were a drug addict  i had emotional problems as a kid because of what happened to my mom  harry said he was trying to help me mut we only talked about his rules  i spent so much time trying to live up to his expectations  because i thought he had my best interests in mind  if you come over this late the least you could do is bring me a coffee   sorry  cappuccino  make a note of it  truth is dex  it doesnt really matter why harry did what he did  the results the same  you have an addiction  do you think harry made me what i am  plenty of people go through trauma without turning to addiction  whatever harry taught you led you down the wrong path  but ive built everything in my life  on what harry said i was supposed to be  my job my girlfriend  its all what harry told me i needed  what do you think you need  i have no idea  whatevers inside you is splattered all over  that paper i took from your lab  looks messy  it probably is  look dexter  everyone has a moment  when they realize their value system is different from their parents  mine was in college but  maybe youre a late bloomer   lucky me  damn right lucky you  you get to have a fresh start  whatever you thought or did doesnt matter  now you get to figure out who you are  i went to lila for answers but now all i have is more questions  who am i what do i need  what do i want  coffee i really want a cup of coffee   what up halfday  is there coffee left  youre late  i fell asleep before you got home last night were you at ritas  youre welcome ass   your brother looks like shit  tell me about it  i may be out of line with this but did he fall off the wagon  what wagon  the only wagon hes ever had is a radio flyer  your brothers a junkie  isnt he  are you high hes never even smoked a cigarette  im glad you got some new material though  cause freak and psycho were getting kind of tired  agent lundy  so i hear a rumor youre tracking all our internet activity  is it true  cause i can explain all that shemale stuff  i need my team outside in five minutes  that sounds important  got a major break in the investigation  patrol found a guy saying he escaped the bay harbor butcher  he claimed he was captured two hours ago  thats a neat trick considering i was asleep  at least trying to sleep  this could be good news for me   morgan  yes  the other morgan  id like you to join us if you can spare him  thats fine with me   is there blood  not that im aware of  but what about masuka  yeah im the lead forensics investigator  masukas lab work is more pressing i need him to hold down the fort here  he totally saw the shemale stuff  so what do you say  ill buy you lunch after pork sandwich right   yes sure  good  i figured it was time to get a fresh perspective on the case  rumor has it you have a knack for attracting serial killers  i hear the same about you  dexter also enjoys long walks on the beach and foreign films  then we got a lot to talk about  he knocked me out  then when i woke up i was tied up in that train car over there   you said he used rope  dumb fuck  i stretched it out enough so i can get my legs free  and i got out of there  ran across the road almost got hit by that guy in the car  so thats the alleged victim of the bay harbor butcher  but ive never seen him before in my life  oconnor singer make sure you take pictures of those footprints   hey dex  hey  so the victim says the butcher held him in this train car  lundy wants you to search for trace evidence   your spidey sense tingling yet  well see when i get inside  take your time  weve never been this close to this pendejo  closer than you think amigo  he may have borrowed my pseudonym but this guy doesnt know  the first thing about my techniques  amateur  why do you think it was the butcher  he told me the bay harbor butchers gonna clean up miami  he said youre gonna get what you deserve  and what do you deserve mr henry  well look the butcher kills criminals right  i just got out of jail you know  six years for aggravated assault and home invasion so  he kills murderers you didnt kill anyone did you  alright i gave this old guy a heart attack  its not like i was doing it on purpose alright  i used to hit retirement homes communities  snowbirds are easy targets  and i dont do that anymore i did my time  your mother must be so proud  i wanna check out the train car with your brother  why dont you keep an eye on our friend here  while we confirm his story  sure  killing tools left behind id never be this careless  whoever did this would never pass harrys muster  then again neither would harry  he lied about my past  he cheated on my foster mother with my biological mother  maybe lilas right its time for a new set of standards  if you were the bay harbor butcher  would you use a place like this  actually yes  location wise its not a bad choice  its quiet  remote  could use an upgrade in the lighting department but  you think this is our guy  not exactly  from what i understand  the conditions in this space dont support his mo  its filthy for one thing  butchers clean  orderly  and some people would say compulsive  really you think hes compulsive  that doesnt fit either  a hatchet is sloppy  the butcher uses precise surgical instruments  hes not that predictable  is he mixes it up different tools every time  and never rope  he uses duct tape and plastic wrap   plastic wrap how can you tell  depression patterns in the skin  maybe the butchers having an identity crisis   its entirely possible  but not likely  my guess is were looking for a vigilante  inspired by the butchers principles  bet he never thought hed be a role model  i bet youre right  so  any new leads on the real guy  not yet  we hope the camerasll turn something up   cameras  in the marinas  put them in a couple of days ago to monitor for suspicious activities  good news for all those cops who keep boats at coral cove  youve got one too right  weve been needing a security upgrade for a long time now  has lundy seen me on the tape  is that why he invited me along today to mess with me  sorry if i was short with you this morning  im lost without my morning coffee  whatever  how was your playdate with lundy did you bond  you didnt tell me they put up security cameras at the marinas  its not like theyre doing us any good  the stations computers need an update  so we can synch up with lundys equipment   the cameras arent recording  they are but nobody saw the footage  lundy said it should be fixed by tonight  thats a relief  your mom told me about your cultural presentation at school  did your teacher give you a country yet  saudi arabia  no thats israel  i wont tell the saudis you said that  looks like codys enjoying himself  dexters very patient with him  dexters a saint  wheres astor  uh shes by the water  i want to say goodbye  i gotta go i was supposed to meet lila   whos lila  his sponsor  really a woman  dexters sponsor is a woman is that a problem  is she attractive   mom  im just curious  is she  i have an idea  why dont you and lila have dinner with us  thats very kind of you gail but  i think itd be really nice if we got to know the woman  you spend so much time with   mom theyre doing step work  but they have to eat right  here let me help  thank you  so lovely of you to have me over  now i can put names to faces dexter talks about you all the time  good things i hope  dexter never says a bad word about anyone  tell me lila  what exactly are you recovering from  im a meth addict sober five years  i dont know much about meth   ritas exhusband shot heroin  like dexter  guess we know your type dont we  just cant seem to help myself  you have nothing to worry about with dexter i mean  im sitting right here   i didnt mean to imply  no i completely understand  ritas your little baby  you have every right to be concerned  but if i can reassure you dexters doing incredibly well  well im happy to hear that  and im sure its got everything to do with the two of you  he tells me youre very supportive  dexters lucky to have you  well thats very sweet of you to say  so tell us more about yourself  dexter tells me youre an artist  yeah she does amazing things with a  blowtorch whats it called  talent  but im not the only artist at the table   since when  its not really art  shes talking about a bloodspatter pattern she took from work  what kind of career choice is blood spatter exactly  he helps catch criminals mother  and it makes perfect sense what with dexters mother and everything  you know  shes   dead  forgot the bread  dinner was fantastic rita  and this dessert  i never thought id say this but i kind of like her  yeah me too  shes really helping me  i wish she didnt have to help you tonight  why what are you thinking   my mom could watch the kids  i have to swing by the office tonight  i need to take care of something really important  i mean cant it wait till morning  i promise well go straight to bed  youre very convincing  but it needs to get done tonight  just give me an hour okay  meet you back at my place  i still think its funny you write childrens books  yeah a big tough guy like me  should be do something manly like wrangling cattle  i dont even know any kids books  my dad told me cop stories before bed  it was really the only alone time i ever got with him  you okay  yeah  sorry just an annoying day at work  you know the fbi guy i was talking about  i was really starting to feel like i was his goto girl  but  he realized dexter is the superior morgan  i should be used to it you know  it was like that with my dad work  i guess i hoped lundy would be different   why  i dont know  i respect him  hes great at his job  supersmart  and like funny but in this really dry way where he doesnt even know it  you love him  what  you totally have a crush on grundy   lundy  now youre getting touchy about it  i dont have a crush on him  hes like my dad  except i spent my life trying to get my dad to notice me  and he actually pays attention to what i say  and grundy loves you  oh fuck off  lundys good  doublelocked  and a bit beyond my expertise  i could try to crack it open but in my own station  too risky  i can do this more often now that my moms in town  i feel like were being bad  bad  bad is good  let the machine get it  hey dex just calling to check in  thought we could do the debriefing on dinner  i thought it went well dont you  id say so  ritas sweet very martha stewart  i love martha stewart  god her mum shes got quite the rod up her ass doesnt she  by the way i am such a twat  i cant believe i almost slipped up about your mum  at least i didnt spill the beans about our road trip  dont you dare  can you imagine ritas face if i told her you and i  spent the night together in a hotel  anyway  you and lila stayed in a hotel together   we had adjoining rooms  adjoining rooms right  god i am such an idiot  i cant believe i defended you while you were sleeping with another woman  wait  i thought you were different than paul but youre the same  actually youre worse you made me trust you   please just let me explain  ive had it  i have been patient and understanding but theres only so much i can take  youre a liar and a cheat and i am through  its over dexter  tracy jenkins was given the liver of a 9yearold  hi honey  i thought you were spending the night at dexters  we had a fight   i think we broke up  what  mamas here  yesterday i was so hopeful  a new me a new life  but a life without rita seems strange  what in the name of fuck are you doing up so early  i got to get to the station  are you okay  you seem weird  weirder than usual  rita broke up with me last night  seriously  what happened  its a long story  ive got time  yeah but i dont  cliff notes  she thinks i did something bad but i didnt  did you tell her that  i tried but she dumped me before i had a chance to explain  she said its over and left   did you go after her  was i supposed to  youre such a guy  when i get pissed i say stuff i dont mean all the time i hate you  i faked it   youre hung like a grape  you lost me  when rita said its over im sure she didnt actually mean it  stop being a douche bag and go fight for her  shes fucking perfect  i know  sure ill be right there  yeah ill tell him  whos that gabriel  no lundy  hes holding a meeting at the station about the bay harbor case  he specifically requested that you be there  i missed my window hes already seen the footage   me why  because youre his new butt buddy  you gonna be okay  check back with me later  the show has already started but have they seen the feature presentation  bane of the bay harbor butcher starring dexter morgan as himself  its all synched up  yep you can watch streaming video of the marina right now if you want to  yeah maybe youll get to see some pontoon poon  did you need something  thats not my marina  yet  ill be making my onscreen debut soon enough  ive got to find a way to get to those video files  the media frenzy about the butcher  has come back to bite us big surprise  now weve got a wannabe vigilante out there  who liked the butchers style and thought  hey i should try this at home  he attacked this man  john henry  exconvict preyed on the elderly  it gets better  i have already received reports of ads on craigs list  and coffeeshop bulletin boards requesting the services of the butcher  people think theyve found their own personal batman  this is not good news  if this kind of thing catches on were looking at an epidemic   kind of like herpes  fuck masuka im trying to listen  one in four morgan one in four  vigilante justice is domestic terrorism  and terrorism prevention is the fbis top priority  ive done my best to be diplomatic  but if we lose one life to a vigilante  i will pull this case from miami metro and hand it over in full  to the fbi its a promise  thats a disaster itd be raining feds in miami  so if we want to keep the investigation here  we need to nip this in the bud  make an example of our wouldbe vigilante  the last thing we need is a bunch of weekend warriors  i think i found a suspect  could you  ken olson  olsons mother was hurt badly in a homeinvasion robbery  guess who hurt her  please tell me john henry our traincar victim  i think olson attacked him for revenge   any evidence  only circumstantial   can you get him here for questioning  cant find him  ok leak this to some of your media contacts  lets beat this guy out of the bushes nice work detective lets get moving  i need hard evidence on this olson character and fast  and if you can find the guy even better  the full force of the fbi  thats the last thing i need  ive got to make sure lundy gets his man  after i figure out a way to erase the marina files  and make up with my girlfriend  then maybe ill tackle world hunger cause things cant really get worse  another shipments coming in tomorrow  cocaine  how much  300 bricks give or take  turn it off  that wasnt part of our agreement harry  i said turn it off  i heard what you said i just dont take orders from you  is there a reason youre in my lab sergeant doakes  is there a reason youre listening to tapes as old as you are  i had a little talk with your sister  turns out she didnt know you were in program   anonymous sergeant  how long did you say you been clean  actually i didnt because its none of your goddamn business  so if i were to take a hair from your desk and run it for drugs  it would come back positive right  because why would someone pretend to be an addict if hes not  unless hes got something a hell of a lot worse to hide  back  the fuck  off  you want to hit me go for it  ive been waiting for a chance to take your ass out  i know how you feel sergeant  i want to file a formal complaint against doakes  jesus dexter the two of you  he crossed the line lieutenant  he broke into my lab he went through my personal things  he threatened me hes probably gonna start tailing me again   sergeant doakes tailed you  for weeks maybe longer  ok you have every right to file a complaint  but before you do that id like the chance to talk to james myself  hes really not much of a talker  im asking you as a personal favor to me to hold off  can you do that  yeah  okay in the meantime i strongly encourage you  to take a break for a couple of hours just go somewhere cool off  no   excuse me  i need to be here lieutenant  this is really not a good time for me to leave  it isnt a suggestion dexter its an order  clear the station clear your head  i dont want to see you here until after lunch  understood  blimey look at you  you wanna tell me whats going on  whats going on  being the new me sucks  im about to be found out at work for what i am  for what i really am  and i cant do anything to stop it  because i got kicked out of the office to cool off  it seems to be going well for you  add to that the fact that rita heard your message  and dumped me last night  i tried to explain to her nothing happened but she wouldnt listen to me   nobody fucking listens to me  listen you need to calm down  last time you came back covered in blood  so  you said i was supposed to feel my feelings  now i tell you to get them under control   you dont understand  why dont you make me  which step was that  the naughty one  what are you thinking  absolutely nothing  i guess we found a way to quiet the voices in your head  i guess so  how do you feel  much better  actually  i guess i must be a good sponsor after all  definitely  and where are you off to  i still have that thing at work to deal with  well come back tomorrow  i promise you some serious recovery  hello  dexter hey   you at work  i will be soon  i was just taking a break  whats going on  id really like to get together and talk  i dont like how our last conversation ended  me neither  you said you wanted to explain and i owe it to you to hear you out  i owe it to us  okay  so can you come over after work  sure  great  apparently my new life involves a love triangle  im that guy  the voices are back excellent  you were tailing dexter what the hell were you thinking  if you wanted to have lunch you could have asked  if dexter files a complaint you will be kicked off the force end of story  theres a reason he hasnt reported me until now  hes hiding something i can feel it  is this another one of your conspiracy theories  its instinct and a hell of a lot of experience  ive spent years looking the enemy in the face  and im telling you morgan is dangerous  your instincts havent been that great these days james  two shootings in the last six months  stalking a police employee  listen to me  morgan lied about the icetruck killer  that crack pipe knew more than he told us  he was trying to protect his sister you of all people should understand  i followed him to an na meeting that asshole lied about that too   youre obsessed  im not  you are and i need you to see it  as your boss and as your friend  weve been through this before  last time it cost you our relationship  this time its gonna get you kicked off the force or worse  ill take my chances  let it go  i mean it  leave dexter alone  the batista suspect come in yet the wannabe vigilante  olson just came in saw himself on the 300 news  and showed up with his lawyer  i hope we nail his ass to the wall  i love it when you talk dirty   morgan  right here  the other morgan  i didnt know you were a smoker  have you seen dexter morgan  hes on a break why  detective batistas got a suspect in interview room 1  we think hes the wouldbe vigilante who attacked our traincar victim  i need him to take some scrapings for evidence  you want to use dexter again isnt masuka on your task force  yes he is  so mr olson the man who assaulted your mom was attacked yesterday   did you know that  nope  cant say im upset though son of a bitch almost killed my mom  my clients emotional detective   im sure hes not trying to say  any idea who might have done it  i dont know maybe it was the butcher  i think a guy like that  should be running the police force not hiding from it   is this a lion or a hippo  i think its a lion  tastes like a hippo   animal cracker  no thank you  what do you do for a living mr olson  i just lost my job  thats too bad  i see that you have a minor assault record  and no alibi for yesterday morning  im sure my client didnt realize he needed one  you have a girlfriend mr olson  she just broke up with me why you interested  just curious  now this is a lion  alright let me keep this all straight  no job  no relationship  you got guns and a minor assault record   and i voted for bush both times  sorry were you getting at something  what hes getting at mr novik is your client fits the 4point profile  of someone whod commit a vigilante offense youre a ticking time bomb  you ask me you just needed a reason to take the law into your own hands  and the butcher was the perfect excuse   you dont know me  we know you attacked john henry  you need proof to make those kinds of accusations detective  you heard the man detective weve got work to do  make yourself comfortable mr olson were just getting started with you  thats my marina  and in less than 30 minutes ill be on that screen  i need to take care of this and fast  im out of time  i need an idea a sign  anything  what would the old dexter do  definitely not that  no security cameras  apparently the new dexters stuck in high school  maybe i am a late bloomer  a fire drill are you kidding we have work to do  its probably one of those kids in the bullpen  its something i would have done  well at least it stopped raining  all clear everybody out  all clear everybody out  respect the vest  dont make me take out my hose  like it never happened  if only the rest of life were so easy to figure out  where you headed  i figured youd be 1st to ogle the firemen  i have to arrange protective custody for that fucking traincar victim   why  cause we have nothing on olson  not even enough to get a warrant to search his place  is that olsons file  if we dont get something soon lundyll have to let him go  meaning olson will kill again  meaning we lose the butcher case to the fbi   meaning were fucked  some more than others  no shit till lundy showed up  i felt like the dipshit who slept with the icetruck killer  if he pulls the plug i go back to being the resident retard  chin up little sister  these things have a way of working themselves out  i just have to find a piece of evidence  to make sure lundy catches olson fair and square  looks like i have a fan club membership of one  why you so interested in the butcher  who the fuck are you  holy shit youre him arent you  stop dont kill me dont kill me  im like you i take out criminals  you mean you try pitifully  no that was just the last one  he got away  i should have never made it personal   youve killed others  thats im telling you  first was a drug dealer  i ran him down with my car  it felt it felt fucking great  even better than the free stash i got off him  and then this guy at work  found out i was fucking his wife he started to beat on her  so i pushed him down a stairwell  the cops thought it was an accident but it was me  see you cant kill me  i wasnt going to  until now  this is what the kill room should look like  the inside of a big plastic bag  of course i spent hours working in this train car yesterday  so im not too worried about trace evidence  to your credit your location was well chosen  it just needed a little cleaning a few lights  proper tools of course   i did it because of you  no  you attacked those people because you wanted to   you inspired me  i didnt    with your principles  theyre not mine   of course they are  dont tell me who i am  all my life ive done what someone else said i should do  been who he said i should be i followed his rules i stuck to his plan  i never stopped to think about what i wanted and what i needed  and now i dont know who im supposed to be  ill tell you one thing though im not the bay harbor butcher  im certainly not anybodys role model  what are you talking about then who are you  ill let you know when i figure that out  though i got to tell you  i am well on my way because  as sure as im standing here i dont need to kill you  thats a relief  i mean that need that comes from within  that always drives me to this table  i dont feel it  im in recovery   i knew you werent gonna kill me  no i will kill you i have to  i just dont need to its very empowering  anyone in there make yourself known  arm  leg  head  its olson giftwrapped  it would seem the butcher is watching us   tracking the investigation  that wouldnt be too hard to do  but whyd he leave the victims body for us its a 1st  probably didnt take too kindly to the idea of olson imitating him  its a good way to discourage others dont you think  i hate to say it but he probably did us a favor  take the law into your own hands the bay harbor boogeymanll get you  its the 1st time weve set foot in a place  where the bay harbor butchers actually been lets get busy   anybody seen lundy  over there on the phone  hes talking to dc i think  shit is he gonna pull the case from us  sure have robinson call me hes got my cell  i came here for privacy officer morgan   sorry  too much background noise over there  hearings the first thing to go   or is it memory i always forget  you gonna pull the case from us   you said if anybody died  at the hands of a vigilante  this was our killer im afraid youre still stuck with me  will your brother be here tomorrow  yeah i think so  ill tell him you want him within shouting distance  what just happened  no its cool hes always been the family superstar   who dexter your new goto guy  this isnt about dexter its about masuka i cant stand him  if i hear one more titty joke i could punch him in the face  really  any north unit request has been made for 42 escort from orange belt to jms  hey  come on in  sit down  i was angry before when you tried to explain  this time ill listen  im sorry i didnt tell you about the road trip  lila  came with me to naples  as my sponsor  thats all  why would you need her in naples  you remember when i went out of town  i went to find the man who killed my mother  what are you talking about  a lot of stuff has been coming up for me in recovery  things i never thought id deal with  i watched my mother die   when i was 3  god  im so sorry  she was murdered  in front of me  i saw it happen  i think that has a lot to do with why im   why i do the things i do  of course of course it makes sense  i found the man who killed her in naples  i thought maybe if i talked to him i could find some kind  of closure  thats why lila came with me for support   what  this was a huge moment  in your life dexter  and you chose to include lila  but not me   shes my sponsor  and im your girlfriend  i was afraid you wouldnt understand  so  let me try to understand now  you and lila  went away together as sponsor and sponsee  and you really did have adjoining rooms  so you didnt have sex that night  not that night  leave  rita  no please leave now  there was a time i would have done anything to protect rita  i would have even lied  but today i told the truth  even though i knew shed get hurt  maybe i am leaving the old me behind
