days  is like a straight ticket to the unemployment line  either i get a lead that bleeds or basically im done  are the sweeps connected to the shootings of agent lundy   i know its really tough for reporters right now  so maybe instead of this one i can give you  that interview youve been wanting from me  mother shit fuck  how tall was my shooter   my height   then it wasnt trinity  nope   i was a dressoverthehead party girl  you must think im   totally charming   we broke up officially   if i find out this is bullshit  there will be severe careerending consequences   fuck it   no more

im having two turkey dinners this year  the dna sweep didnt give them trinity  but it did bring in a cornucopia of criminals  that should keep miami metro off the trinity case  through the holiday  deb wont be anywhere near as easy   im sorry dex but im spending thanksgiving  with 90 or so of my newest friends  look at these victims  it looks like a family portrait  the bathtub women theyre always young and single  a first girlfriend maybe  and then the jumpers always a mother of two  maybe that represents his mom or his wife  but i dont think this guys married  and the bludgeonees always a father   you used to love thanksgiving when we were kids  you wore the little indian headdresses  picked the pearl onions out of the green beans   yeah moms green beans  and then she died  and it was you and me and dad and football  and tv dinners in aluminum trays  talk about your lonely   well you wont be lonely at our house  youll never get the chance   dexter i am lead detective  on the biggest case of my career  this is where i belong   i thought batista was lead   hes the lead on lundy now  once we figured out trinity didnt shoot me  there was no conflict for me  what  wait  trinity didnt shoot you   while you were at your rain man convention  masuka and i put it together form the bullets trajectory   how did i not see that   we were too close  thats what happens when you make it personal     so ive heard  so who shot you   maybe trinity knows  ill ask him when i haul his ass in here   deb you really really need to come to thanksgiving   tell the family i said hi   all
