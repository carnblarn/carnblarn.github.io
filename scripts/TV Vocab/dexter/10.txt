and you better make room theres a lot more coming  shooters at the bel canto tonight you in  im not in the mood  angel youre on the market  and the bel canto is hottie central  look at this  they were for ninas birthday   backstage passes to neil diamond  youre in worse shape than i thought   oh hi  hi  oh masuka was looking for you  something about drinks at the bel canto  yeah i told him i had a yeast infection  a  bit of an overshare  you want to talk about what happened today  already did  dexter the last time i saw you like that  was when dad died  can talk to me you know  just got to open your mouth and move it  ill call rudy ill tell him ill be late  deb seriously   i puked  im fine  i know you want to help  but unless you have breath mints theres nothing to do  why do you always do this   do what  you shut me out  like your birth father that lived up the highway  your whole life and never tried to contact you  i  still dont know how that makes you feel  ill tell you what if some random emotion strikes me  in the middle of the night youll be the first one i call  fine  whatever  did paul force his way into the house  no  did you ask him to leave  yes and he refused  but in your statement it says  you invited your exhusband into your bedroom  he was drunk and the kids were asleep  and i knew exactly where this was heading   cracked ribs and a broken jaw  and you didnt want it to escalate i understand that  but we cant prove intent  your exhusband has the injuries here not you  paul has a record of spousal abuse  spousal abuse can be mutual  it was never mutual  okay  but the man is a model parolee  his drug tests are clean  hes got glowing reports from the courtappointed supervisor  corrections will want to see this guy transition  i dont care  hes not going near my children do you understand  rita  if you deny him visitation  you could lose your children  now you have deposition in two days  do not give this man any more ammunition than he already has  okay  damn  just blood  what happened to the bodies  hell if i know  i dont want to know  blood was bad enough  no wonder you seem so amped  your brother must have loved it   fuck no he freaked  really  i thought you know blood was his thing  what happened  i don know it was like usual he shut me out   did he say anything  lets not talk about dex right now  was it like a panic attack  i dont know  hes not really big into sharing his feelings  in case you hadnt noticed  kiss me  whats the matter you dont even have wood  well youre the one that said you wanted to talk  yeah but not now im horny  maybe i should call him  are you fucking kidding me  what we  we bonded last weekend  isnt that what boyfriends are supposed to do  show some interest in the family  yeah but not when his girlfriends trying to get into his pants  deb thats not fair  you take me out on a   couples weekend to get to know your brother  and then you punish me for giving a damn  i mean your issues dont have to be mine  you know what  forget it lets just go to sleep  okay im gonna go watch tv  she loved him so goddamn much  she took every one of his cds in the separation  she wouldnt even give me his greatest hits  nina loved neil diamond  song sung blue  september morn  oh my god  kentucky woman  you got to love that shit  thats like the fourth chick youve driven off  waitress is there a waitress  i need a drink waitress  bro youre a train wreck  look you got to stop talking about the divorce  i aint ashamed  yeah i think thats clear but its pathetic  look  dont talk about the divorce unless they ask  comprendo   eightysix the ring  i have to take a squirt  shes gonna fuck me silly  my sisters right i dont share my problems with her  or with anybody  harry taught me that  secrecy selfreliance  and a wellstocked  cupboard of hefty bags  fortunately ive never met a problem i cant manage  until that boy in the blood  he scares me i want him to go away  you awake  what  are you sure you locked the door  yeah im positive  bolt and chain  what  am i gonna do  dont worry ill figure it out  and i will  i can always see other peoples problems  more clearly than my own  fortunately ritas has a name  everyone who set foot on the bloody carpet  in room 103 left a footprint  and since we do shoe molds of everyone on personnel  that leaves only one set of footprints unaccounted for   the killers  this shows everywhere he went in the room   the question is why  hold on  arent we missing something  where are the victims footprints  give that lady a lollipop  are you suggesting there were never any bodies in room 103  why would a guy stage a massacre and not have any bodies  and whered he get the blood  ive just got a preliminary blood report  the blood in that room came from at least 5 different bodies  possibly more  my fellow traveler had five victims  icetruck killer had 5 victims   i always wondered what he did with the blood  wait wait  the icetruck killer did not horde his victims blood  just to have a party at the motherfucking marina view hotel  why would he do that  to chase me down the rabbit hole  what was that morgan  i didnt say anything  ill remind you people   we arrested the icetruck killer  his name is neil perry and hes awaiting trial in county  bullshit  neil perry recanted his confession hes a fraud   try telling that to the capital  i did  do we have any more evidence to support this theory  when masuka noticed the blood wasnt clotting  i ran some tests  and it was loaded with coumadin and heparin  ones an anticoagulant the others a preservative  it means the bloods old  plus the blood spatters all impact and castoff  there are no hand transfers or  swipe patterns to indicate the presence of any actual victims  masuka run the dna on all five vics  and see if it matches  the icetruck killers victims  you two get out to the marina view hotel  retrace his steps  maybe itll tell us something  and not a word to anyone about the icetruck killer  all right astor just stand up straight  now do you have the emergency phone number list  its in my backpack do i have to show it to you again  just promise me you wont let your brother out of your sight  rita  youre scaring them  yeah well they should be  i didnt tell them what paul did the other night  whatd you say when you dragged them to the neighbors  i smelled gas  i should have just thrown them in the car  and headed out of state gone back to michigan  remember what the lawyer said  you dont want to do anything rash  just relax the court supervisor will be there the whole time  hey buddy come on wheres the love come on  daddy what happened  oh nothing buddy just a little bump on the head thats it  hey were going to the circus  were going to the circus cause daddy always keeps his promises remember  good  all right ready  got your stuff  lets go  you okay  i prefer the enchanting rita over the worried one  if i can figure out a way to make her exhusband my problem  i can help her sleep much easier tonight  all i need is a little proof of his inner monster  harry would have insisted on that  harry didnt believe in preemptive killing  but maybe i can bend the rules just this once  after all harry wasnt perfect  he lied about my birth father  the trifecta  weapon ammo and impaired judgment  throw in a little domestic violence  and you have the perfect recipe for a family slaughter  mommy  hide your head dexter  close your eyes  no  so after he soaked the room in blood  he crossed to the desk  and then over to the bedside table  theres a clock radio and some smeared blood  maybe he turned it on  no were missing something lets go over it again  weve been over it three times  well maybe the maps wrong  call your brother  what  why is everybodys first move to call dexter  you dont even like him  whatd the freak do this time  boil your goldfish  no its just  its rudy  we had our first fight  tiff i dont know whatever you want to call it  i thought we were talking about your brother  we were  and well be back with billy joel the eurythmics  and devo on 103 fm   hits from the 80s  turn that off  no wait i want to hear it  its devo turn that shit off  he said 103 fm this is room 103  leviticus 103   103  103  son of a bitch  you think hes trying to tell us something  i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me  and before all people  i will be glorified  hey  hey  debs pissed at me i need advice  so you came here  you know you know her better than anyone  come on i got two porterhouses  and a sixer of microbrew  well one minute were talking about her day  you know the whole bloodbath thing  right  and the next she wants to  jump my bones  i mean debs hot and all but  sprinkle in a little conversation once in a while you know  shes my sister i dont know  can i help you find something  you wouldnt happen to have a good meat knife  thanks  anyway  the other half of the argument  was about you  me  yeah it was already tense enough but  when i brought your name she lost it  so what do i do  tell her its all your fault   seriously  you will eventually  deb has a way of wearing you down  just start from there its easier  i got to take this you mind if i  hey where are you  still at work chasing a lead  let me guess   the bloodbath case  i dont want to talk shop right now  baby i am so sorry  you were totally right  i was mad at dexter and i took it out on you  my shifts almost done you want to come over and talk  id love to babe but  im about to eat dinner with dexter  well after  yeah but heres the thing  i think im gonna sleep at my place tonight  i mean its closer and  im drinking you know  you understand right  yeah  ill call you tomorrow   care to dance  you dance to this  a bit  what about your wife  tan line on your ring finger  well um  im not gonna talk about that tonight  divorced i get it  mine was just finalized  lets go  will you excuse me  excuse me  police i need to talk to you  im not a hooker anymore  i work for a legitimate escort service now  im not here to bust anyone  i just need to know why you paint your nails the way you do  he was a real good client  you want to spend the night in a cell  all right about a year ago there was this guy   guy or client  a john okay  thats when i worked calle ocho  anyway he started getting all rough with me until he saw this  then what  then he changed his tune got all turned on  told me to take my fake hand off  he started doing some kinky weird stuff  like he was worshipping it  to cap it off he takes all my nail polish  and paints each nail a different color  i liked it so i kept doing it  you know that guy on the news  they arrested for the icetruck killings  yeah the one who stuffs roadkill   is that the guy  no way  my trick hes sexy   a freak but sexy  okay  from the beginning and with more detail  well thanks for the hospitality  hey thanks for the steaks  you know i didnt get a chance to ask  deb mentioned that you had a little   incident at the crime scene  did she  well most of my prosthetic clients  are pretty traumatized by the time they get to me  anyway im a good listener  if you ever want to talk  thanks but unless you know an expert in   repressed memories  for real  you know something about it  more than i ever wanted to  when i was in high school i started having these dreams  of a woman hit by a truck  who was she  i didnt know  then one day  i stopped by a mailbox  and it all came crashing back  my mom  getting out to mail a letter  me still in the car  i watched her die  how old were you   i didnt remember anything till i   went and mailed a letter  walked right into the belly of the beast without knowing it  what kind of memories are you having  theyre still a little vague  right  well youre gonna have to face it eventually  maybe next time  when you see deb go with white roses  theyre her favorite  thats a good tip  its funny how life brings people together huh  rudy misunderstands my problem  i want the boy and blood to go away  not come crashing back  fortunately i have other peoples problems to focus on right now  like forgotten cellphones  what do you got  well so far were chasing a ghost  couple of employees helped with the sketch but  its pretty generic  only real lead we have is a couple of numbers  he set at the crime scene  screw the numbers  who was killed where are the bodies  i heard some pretty wild theories out there  just theories  were still waiting for full blood results  damn it maria youre stalling  im just trying to avoid speculation  well you got to give me something and soon  this department cant afford another public relations disaster  well  maybe you should tell the da to let neil perry go  hes not the icetruck killer  are you still hung up  i cant believe this  jesus maria thats not gonna happen  the da takes his cues from us  if you just tell him you made a mistake  not going to happen now let it go  first break in this case you come straight to me  this may be a shot in the dark but i met this hooker last night  going with a pro  now thats how you get over the ex  no thats not what i mean  so you didnt fuck her but she blew you right  would you shut up  it was a lead  on what  ill let you know if it pans out but  what do you know about amputee fetishes  oh yeah  yeah yeah yeah i know its its called acrotomophilia  but dont let them hear you call it that  it sounds like a disease  no they prefer to be known as devotees  i knew you were the man to ask  not really  i prefer a girl with a kung fu grip  you know who you should talk to  its whats his face  debs boyfriend  prosthetics guys deal with devotees all the time  thanks  no memory flashes here  no little lost boy in blood  maybe he went back to hiding  in the dormant reaches of my cerebral cortex  heres to hoping   yo dex  hey  so this is what you do for a living  im trying to match castoff patterns from a crime scene  a power tool was used  here you go  oh thanks  circular saw  seems like thered be an easier way to make a mess like this  yeah trust me i know ive been in here for hours  you know in my line of work  you hear all sorts of horror stories   boat propellers  garbage disposals  it seems like something youd see with a chainsaw  yeah i hear that  but this power tool was plugged into a socket  guess you havent heard of an electric chainsaw  come on people were coming up empty  those numbers mean something 103  we need to find the connection and until we do  you need to go over every page of every police report  you wrote in the last six months  think  bus station locker  piece of a bank account  area code  partial license plate  what is it i want answers  what are you doing here  how do you always do it  do what  make me feel like im 6 years old all the time  if this is about rudy he was just picking up his cellphone  whered he leave it  my apartment  what was he doing there   uh eating steaks  and  uh i dont know drinking beer  and   debra  and   talking  talking  you talked  you opened your mouth and sounds came out  on the same night that i wanted to talk to you but you shut me out   oh  yeah oh  you dont talk to me dex  youve spent our entire lives keeping me at a distance  but my boyfriend shows up on your doorstep   with a couple of tbones   they were porterhouses  porterhouses  and you end up tossing beers back into the middle of the night  dex you are all the family that i have  and i barely know you  so if youre gonna eat steaks with somebody after a rough day  if somebodys gonna break through your fucking walls  i think it should be me  i think i have earned it  im late for ritas deposition  deb its hard for me you know that  you rudy cooper  angel batista  i work with your girlfriend debra  oh hi nice to meet you  id like to ask you a few questions if you dont mind  sure  let me just grab the door  so  does this have to do with a case  you could say that  well fire away  well i ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand   call girl actually  said she had a very unique client  an amputee devotee  you have a lead on this client  thats the bitch of it  i dont have a goddamned clue  except for the freaky sex stuff  i was hoping that you could  steer me toward some of those weirdos  im afraid i got into this business to help people get better  not help people get off  yeah im sure debra will be happy to hear that  but i can talk to some of my colleagues  see if i can draw up a list of contacts for you  thatd be great  how often does someone get a chance to help catch a bad guy huh  you in a rush for this information  no no im good im chasing a long shot really  well just  give me a call at the station when you got something  will do  good to meet you  good to meet you  last question  according to your exhusband  you left town with your boyfriend last weekend  thats right his father died  did your exhusband have a scheduled visitation  with his children during that time  i told paul id make it up to him  so then he gave you permission  no  im the one that gave him visitation in the first place  im the custodial parent i didnt have to do that   could you give us a second  yes of course  why didnt you tell me you broke your visitation agreement  i didnt know it was a big deal  i think shes answered that last question  so unless theres something else  no thats fine  if i missed anything  well get to it at the psychiatric evaluation next wednesday  nobody told me about any psychiatric evaluation  its mandatory in these cases  the psych test determines if theres a competency hearing  for me  but hes the excon  its standard rita you should be fine  should be  you mean she could actually lose this  guys  im handcuffed here  you violated a custody agreement  you struck your exhusband in your bedroom  he has a case  mama look at my henna tattoo   so how much candy have you had  lots  thanks   now shell never get to sleep  shell calm down soon  this ones already crashed  mom can my dad read me a story  i dont think so honey  please  okay  but just one  put your duds on buddy   spiderman ones i bought you  ill get him ready youve got 20 minutes left  thanks betty thank you  hey rita  it doesnt have to be this way  i mean we can make this easier on each other right  i could drop the charges  if you agree to unsupervised visitation  fuck you  hey dexy  you know i dont think your girlfriend  appreciates the gravity of the situation  if she loses that case she could lose the kids   that wont happen  never say wont  we live in a world of wills   wills and wonders  thats what im trying to teach my children  and they are my children too  something she seems to forget  okay so i made some mistakes  but i learned from it right  hey im sober  look no needle marks  i got the fucking alaskan pipeline running through these veins  and all because of those   two little s of love in the next room  my heart beats for those two kids  so if you or that skinny bitch  try to screw with whats mine  i swear to god i dont care who i have to hurt   harrys first rule was dont get emotionally involved  i think this is why  astor go brush your teeth  someone once said its easier dealing  with other peoples problems than your own  they were wrong  paul  dexter  where were you  taking out the trash  did you see paul  when i was in the side yard  i heard the front door open  hey my dads car is gone  lets face it paul  youve been a problem  its time for you to go away  the icetruck killer case has been reopened  officially  we have new forensic evidence that shows  that the dna from the blood at the marina view hotel  matches the dna from his victims  what about neil perry  isnt he supposed to be the icetruck killer  all those questions should be directed to captain matthews  hes been personally handling the perry case  oh shit  i hope she told the captain  who knew  who knew about this  this is the first were hearing about it captain  the icetruck killer is still at large  sure  ill call you back  you overplayed your hand maria  i gave you a chance to make

floridas three strikes law  hes back in jail  it is truly amazing the things you can do  when you put your mind to it   whats so funny mom  yeah why are you laughing  no problem is insurmountable  not when you have the most accessible evidence locker in miami  paul did need to go away  this is the police   sir youre going to have to turn down the television  but death wasnt the answer  police open
