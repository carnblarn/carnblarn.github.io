side of betrayal  its becoming more and more clear that im going to have to deal with miguel  thank you chef  ah chef babia  option one i kill him  but hes too high profile  a popular ada disappears the manhunt would be endless  everyone he knew would be scrutinized and that includes me  hes also my best man id be expected to grieve  how about this pumpkin and sage ravioli here   oh no thats

sad i mean i had to say something didnt i   i suppose you did  so she called miguels office  and his assistant said that he was meeting with lieutenant laguerta  but then syl checked with your

sylvia  well the groom is supposed to buy his best man a gift  and i know how much miguel loves garcia mrquez  so i thought id pick up a limited edition of one of his books  oh he would like that very much  do you think itd be all right if i looked in miguels den  just to see what he already has  our secret  ok  come in  ill be out in a jiffy  ok  miguel stepped over a line and hell keep stepping  until i have something he cant top something that could put him in jail  if and when i want him there  thats the only way hell back off  i know miguel killed ellen wolf  and i know he took one of her rings as a trophy  the question is where did he hide it  somewhere no one else would ever look  unless  unless theyre me  no more games  hi are you vince  yeah  im tammy okama platinum enterprises   may i sit  yeah sure   youre tammy  mmhm  i was expecting someone   trashy  yeah  thats sweet  so we are planning a bachelor party  yeah but uh keep it down because party boys in the next room  oh

eyes vince  hey dex i got your message did you get a dna match on that key  uh seems so  thank you  i mean it  so wheres the report  if angel wants to kill this guy thats his business  im done getting involved with friends  i heard laguerta gave you shit for this  its all right  but i knew that i can trust you  dont get involved  i heard about detective gianna how is she  what are you doing  ok no concussion  dex the the file  yep  i know how hard it must have been to see her like that  i know what it is to  want to rebalance an unbalanced world  but its just  unbalanced angel and thats it  ok   ok  some doors should stay shut  you open it its too easy to walk through it a second time  ive seen it before recently even  ill keep it in mind  thanks dex  well at least i didnt teach him how to get away with murder im learning  thought you said youd be gone by the time i got back  im just getting some work stuff here  just make sure you get everything  i dont want you using it as an excuse to come back  syl look i  jeez  damn it  please sir this stain just wouldnt come out  you know once blood sets its really hard to get out so no charge  devon parks  hey deb  i wanted to talk to you about the thing you got going with your ci  well hes not a ci  and we dont have anything going not anymore  well that settles that  only a retard would have gotten involved with anton in the first place  i dont know he seemed like a nice enough guy  you seemed to like him  when he went missing all i could think was please god dont let him be dead   and then i get him back  and all i can think is  how wrong he is for me  you know like how bad it makes me look  doesnt matter that he makes me happy  or he makes me feel how youre supposed to feel when youre with the right person  is that crazy  i got nothin  god  you are useless  love you anyway   think this is funny  not at all   they said that stain would come out  fuck you  i didnt get to where i am who i am  by letting some little gusano like you walk all over me wheres my ring  its not your ring its ellens  though you did leave a nice clean print on it  oh theres plenty of blood on your hands too  ethan turner clemson galt  all deserving with nothing to tie me to their deaths  and no bodies to prove that theyre even dead  maybe in a court of law  but hows that little bride of yours gonna feel  when she has to start answering some questions  cause shes gotta wonder where you go what you do who you really are  she knows everything she needs to and its gonna stay that way  or that ring might show up someplace very inconvenient  i am the last person you wanna fuck with  because i will fuck you back  in ways you never even imagined  an anonymous tip couple of search warrants hmm  who knows what the police might find in your apartment or in that little boat of yours  you got the ring  i got city fucking hall  wow i didnt get it before miguel  but you cant be reasoned with guilted controlled  this whole backandforth game for leverage is pointless  thats right ill do what i want when i want  to whomever i want count on it  i will  thank you  harry was right hes always been right  there are the innocent and there are the deserving  have barbara gianna id this guy  some doors should stay closed  some people can understand that  harry also said its all about choices  good and bad  my search for connection always ends in blood  you get a good look at him  yes how do i know this is not a trap  oye if i wanted you in jail  i wouldnt have let you loose in the first place ok  and you believe this man knows where freebo is  hes the only one who does  his name  dexter morgan  you want freebo  you want your money  then you need to have a long conversation with him  even harry would agree miguel has left me no other choice  as challenging as it will be its back to option one  i kill him
