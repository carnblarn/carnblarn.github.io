                 previously on dexter   sorry  it doesnt change the fact  that you slept with another woman  what do they have on me   they found something in your car  shit  our primary suspect is someone you know well   sergeant james doakes  he had the slides   you know me thats not me  dont you disappear on me  what exactly is sergeant doakes problem with you morgan  i always sensed there was something off about him  from here on out well want a protective detail on you at all times  youre a good cop like your old man   do you think they know  not until you tell them  he is not your man  he may be your expartner and best friend to me hes a suspect   what are you doing here  she came to see me  are you pissed or something about lila and me   lilas just using you to get at me  so what  a secret cabin in the middle of the everglades  what more could a rededicated serial killer ask for  youre the bay harbor butcher  youre gonna have to kill me morgan  youre gonna have to fucking kill me morgan  is it deep i hope its fucking deep  its a graze wound minor tissue abrasion  no hemorrhage along the bullet track sorry i think im gonna live  am i  thats a good question  if youre not gonna let me go then kill me now just get it over with  id advise you not to tempt me just now  why couldnt you just leave me to do my work in peace  whyd you have to go and ruin everything  youre a killer i catch killers  so do i i caught you  im not a killer  you are  thats why youve always known what i am  thats why you have more officerrelated shootings  than anybody else  only i dont fuck with you when you shoot somebody  why couldnt you pay me the same professional courtesy  theres nothing professional about what you do  i kill when i have to on the job  so its okay to take a life as long as you get a paycheck for it  the city pays me to keep the law  ive got news for you sergeant  my code requires a higher standard of proof than your citys laws  at zero cost for the taxpayer if you ask me im a bargain  thats enough bullshit morgan  lets get this over with  either kill me or set me free so  i think youd like it if i killed you just to prove your point   you gotta choose  no i need to go home  ive got fbi guards standing outside my door right now  to protect me from you  whats it gonna be morgan  kill me now or set me free you only have two choices  you cant fucking ignore me  whats wrong the place is a ghost town this early  besides i thought we were out as a couple  out and flaunting it are two different things   dont ask dont tell  works for the military  not really  my subpoena for doakes phone records came through   he isnt much of a talker  not a lot of friends im guessing  except for one check this out  thats lt laguertas phone number look at the time and date  he called her right after we launched the manhunt   we could have traced that call  doubt it  sgt doakes wouldnt have stayed on long enough  but laguerta should have given us the chance  youre gonna ream her arent you  can i be there its a hobby of mine  you can ream her yourself  me   i cant dress down my own boss  its your subpoena   your case  our case  and i need to know if your lt can be counted on  you know her better than i do   lox  gross  that would just get me in deeper shit with her  and laguerta already hates me  im not always gonna be around to run interference  come on  you got at least five  i mean i wont be around once this case ends  so a reaming will be good practice for you after im gone  i better refrigerate this  taking a life is one thing  but the care and feeding of it is another  i cant keep my problem locked away in a cabin forever  harry always said there were plenty of people who deserved to die  but no matter how hard i close my eyes and wish  doakes isnt one of them  harry you never prepared me for this one  what do i do  what would you do  get a description of juan ryness to every unit in the city  and wake up judge morehouse i need a warrant for ryness apartment now   fisk make sure you get that print  she was dumped  get back inside the car like i told you  blunt trauma to the head  i went over there no one saw  the blow to the head killed her she took a brutal beating beforehand  the guy who did this is an evil bastard   you know who it was  yeah  ive been trying to get him for a while  a pimp named juan ryness she was one of his girls   she was dumped right  get back in the truck  you awake   you for real  you got a visitor  coffee  yeah why not  i heard the news its everywhere  sgt doakes is the bay harbor butcher  thats what theyre saying  i was right about you are you okay  why is the fbi guarding your building  you know the federal government  any excuse to spend money  its cold  sorry  theres nothing better on a muggy miami morning  than an iced coffee right  how are the kids  they asked about you again  and theyve been pretty confused since we split up  yeah me too  are you still confused  im generally confused most of the time  but not about us  good  its not good  no its  great  to have this  clarity  im really glad you feel that way  the kids have been through so much lately  with pauls death and my mom moving out  i dont want them to feel like theyve been abandoned by everyone they love  does this mean were dating again  that would be kind of fast wouldnt it  i mean youre so important to them  and they need you  but i dont know  i mean maybe we could just  hang  like a sloth  i can do that  well if youre free on saturday were gonna spend the day at the beach  and maybe we could all hang together  a family of sloths  let me get you some ice  ive been selfish only thinking about what happens to me  but if i were ever revealed as the true bay harbor butcher  rita and her children would be destroyed   i need you to take a look at these  i know what they are  you didnt report the call from doakes  your task force doesnt need my help railroading a good cop  doakes was officially a person of interest  not reporting it could be considered aiding and abetting  none of you wanted to hear what he had to say so i didnt tell you   what did he have to say  that hes innocent  you believe him  what do you think   and if he calls again  he wont   and you know this  because i know him   i thought i knew someone too  i know him  so if lundy wants to flag me to captain matthews  you tell him to go for it  but james knows that i believe in him so it was worth the risk  to your job  to your career  you ever care about anyone morgan  then you shouldnt have to ask  cause when you care about someone you do what you have to do  four different aliases all issued by the dod  during doakes stint with special forces  weve attached these names to our temporary felony want so  if he uses one well be notified  i remember when life was easy  when the only question i worried about was whos next  now its how can i dodge my protective detail  what should i do with my hostage  these are not easy questions  would you bring us up to speed on the analysis from the blood slides  of the 46 slides 18 belonged to previously known butcher victims  were still running the dna but weve matched an additional 12  with felons in the criminal database all reported missing  well proceed on the assumption that these 12 were bay harbor victims  its a fair assumption  do you have the new victims jackets  sorry sir not my responsibility  thatd be me  each of the 12 had at least one homicide on their records  and we all know how the butcher loves a killer  were checking into their last known whereabouts and any connection  that their criminal cases may have had with sgt doakes  forensics expect a steady stream of evidence  seized from our suspects apartment over the next few hours  look for any trace evidence that could connect him to these victims  the rest of you have your assignments  lets bring him in   is your sister all right  i wouldnt know  but i wanted to talk to you about my protective detail  angel i hear you have   potential victims  you got names  mind if i keep this  were all working together now why you got an angle on doakes  thats good  thats real good  this is a waste of time if doakes is the butcher  we wont find trace evidence on his clothes  the guy were after is way too careful for that  i have to agree with you there  you think it could be doakes  its not about what i think its all about the evidence  all those times he called me lab geek  fairy winkle donkey fluffer  im just glad i took it lying down you know  what the fuck dex   what which fuck  you got rid of your protective detail  shes gonna hit you isnt she  shes gonna hit someone if you dont get the fuck out of here  hairpulling may not be manly but its very effective  doakes fucking hates you dex   no doubt about that  and hes a trained killer  if he wanted me dead id be dead by now  its supposed to be reassuring  hes a lot of things but hes not an idiot  he wont come out of the shadows because of a grudge  right  cause serial killers are so practical  actually they are  im safer with lundys troops hunting doakes   than babysitting me lundy agrees  because he doesnt give a shit  all he cares about is solving this case and moving on  i thought he was the guy you could count on  you are the only one i can count on jackass  got to give deb credit for one thing she knows how to express her feelings  if i was convicted as the butcher shed probably explode  itd be a waste of a perfectly good cop  and sister  this isnt just about me anymore its about deb  and rita and the kids  i have only one choice for doakes  shit  all right  yes  no reason for you to suffer  you come to a decision  yes but i dont think youre gonna like it  so this is the way it ends  regardless of how we got here  one of the two killers in this cabin has to go away   i am not a killer  right  in terms of who goes it boiled down to a philosophical question  which one of us has more inherent worth  i know youre fucking kidding me  first i considered our value to the community  that was a wash  were both loyal civil servants  we work hard to keep the city clean   you cut people up into little pieces  then  i looked at our personal lives  and well  thats where the differences became clearer  strange as it may seem  i have people who depend on me  they would be devastated if they found out what i do  you sergeant youre more of a lone wolf easier to put down  no one in the pack to miss you  fuck you  fuck you i have a family i have my mother and my sisters  who you never visit  it puts a pit in my stomach  that i can only interpret as  sadness  if you had a personal life  you wouldnt have made me your obsession and we wouldnt be here right now  sergeant why would you hide a dead drug dealers cellphone from me  you working on an exit strategy im afraid thats not gonna happen  if you want to bring me down  youre gonna have to open this goddamn cage first  so come on bring it  i already did you just didnt know it  mother fuck  the sedative works fast its probably best just to go with it  you think youre a fucking hero right cleaning up the fucking streets  your old man would be proud  my old man was proud  he knew  he really was a fucking whack job  namecalling at this juncture  whats the point  besides my father was a legend on the force  thats what you think  they never told you  told me told me what  what about my father  what about my father  a missed call  if its dexter tell him to come over   i have auri on saturday  auri whats an auri  its my little girl  my ex never lets me see her on the weekends  but something came up  i have her all day on saturday  delightful  but tonight you belong to me  yes   and my walls  doakes said i had two choices  kill him or let him go  but he neglected to look behind door number three  hand him over to the fbi giftwrapped  i dont need doakes dead  i just need his fingerprints to complete my frame job  almost forgot  one needs small comforts  every saturday beginning dive classes  practice underwater skills beside this dock  tomorrow theyll find a morbid little surprise  when the feds receive these kill tools with their suspects prints on them  the only threat to me will be the inane rants of a murderous madman  so close i can feel it  this tragic tale might still end  in doakes demise but not by my hands  harrys legacy will remain intact  why in the hell did doakes have to bring up harry  come on  you just cut the cake sweetheart ill see who it is   tom this is a surprise come on in  thanks  sweetheart cut the lieutenant a slice its her birthday  happy birthday hon but no cake for me thanks   can i talk to you in private  sure  save me an end piece  god damn it  ryness is gonna walk because of a goddamn typo  faulty warrant nothing we can do   this is bullshit  harry  dont worry   rynessll make another mistake  yeah right  we just wait for him to kill another girl  sorry  happy birthday kiddo  ill get the vacuum cleaner  you ok dad  i did the right thing in training you  this just proves it  i did the right thing  will you wait   whats going on here  nothing according to you  so i said something  only that this relationship has an expiration date  if you wanna write it off before it even begins go ahead   when did i say that  yesterday  you said when the case ends we end im paraphrasing  i thought you understood when we got involved  i track killers thats what i do   they tend to move around  i know that  then im not sure what you thought would happen when the case ended  honestly i hadnt thought about it  but it looks like you have so now i know  consider me informed  one  how come theres never a circus when you need one  i dont know im not sure ive ever felt that particular need  help me out here   what does a 7yearold girl like  astor likes cnn  yeah thats not gonna fly  i got auri all day on saturday  i want to do something fun  ideally a lot more fun than the stuff her mother does with her  its really not that hard to entertain a kid  rita and i are taking hers to the beach on saturday  see that sounds perfect  itd be great if we could tag along  sure i guess  well be there all afternoon   sorry but whats with the highlights  i was  helping lila paint her loft last night  red the color of pasin  yeah about lila  its probably better for everyone  if she doesnt come along on saturday  bro im not stupid  lila is like my afterhours project  besides she should stay off the beach with skin like that  like a perfect porcelain doll  paid 4 my lift ticket wheres my snow  dont make me come after you  sounds like mr harlow is not only a master of metaphor  but also inclined toward violent confrontation  better find out who he is in case i have to deal with him  armed with a phone number obtaining the mysterious textmessengers id  wasnt too hard but is he a threat  christopher harlow known alias for jose garza  narcotics armed robbery  and currently a fugitive from justice for murder  approach with caution  this guy could be trouble if he has knowledge  of a certain cabin in the everglades  im safe  happy trails harlow  fuck sneak much  sorry i wanted to ask you something  that is some big hair  hard to believe hes our guy  amazing how easy it is to hide who you are from people  not that easy  i was thinking about your birthday  you got like three months just get me a gift certificateat amazon  good to know but the birthday i was thinking about was  when dad threw the beer bottle  jesus  out of the blue what brought that up  harrys been on my mind lately  i was trying to remember  matthews came over that night right  yeah  he and dad got in a fight  i ended up wiping beer off the walls happy birthday to me  a killer went free that would upset any cop right   nothing weird about that  no it wasnt weird  it was just another example of dads priorities  kids versus case case always won  did he say anything else about it to you  right  dad sitting down with me to have a hearttoheart  not that i didnt want to   maybe you should have told him that  yeah  maybe  deb had it rough harry had his hands full teaching me a trade  but was there something else going on with him  or was doakes just trying to shake me up  i need to know if theres more to the story  theres a complication i dont need   hey baby what brings you back  i have two more walls at home  waiting for your expertise as a painter  theres nothing id like to do more but  but what darling  i pick up auri remember  well meet dexter and rita at the beach  i have a friend at miami art museum  teaches an incredible childrens class airconditioned  bring the whole gang if you like  you mind if i take a rain check  with your history with dexter it might be a little awkward  he tries to work things out with rita  is he now  you have a great day  and watch out for those sand fleas  damn she better be worth it  what was that shit last night some kind of fucking scare tactic  you said something before you passed out about my father   what was it  i dont know  what was it i was kind of drugged at the time  dont test me  i could have killed you  i didnt  you didnt because you cant  ive had time to think about this  i dont fit that code you were talking about do i  at first i thought the butcher only went after criminals  because nobody gives a damn what happens to them but now   now i think you got a conscience  of course i have a conscience  i left you a place to shit didnt i  its a small conscience  youre actually angry  ive never seen you angry this is good  i might live to see the outside of this cabin after all  whatd you say about harry the words whack job were involved  is that what youre worried about  i guess it would bother me too if it were my old man  ok what the fuck  you know how ive been looking into your past right  thats why youre in a cage  i found something i wasnt supposed to see   its about your fathers death  heart disease big mystery  no the mysterys bigger than that  and someone up high didnt want it solved  youre lying  it was buried deep but it was there  what was there  how about we go outside and talk about this  i could use some air   not gonna happen  yeah well  then the mystery remains  im sure special ops taught you to rattle your captor  but i should warn you  you cant play on my feelings  i dont have any  oh really  whos lying now  slow down  thats it   hello dexter  captain  please im a civilian today call me tom  you start your round yet  im afraid bayshore is a little outside my pay scale  so what brings you here on a saturday morning  i wanna know if theres anything unusual about my fathers death  go on ahead ill catch up  his heart gave out you know that   i heard there was more to it  from whom  does it matter  i guess it was inevitable youd find out one of these days  you know harry was a good friend  he was a great cop  but  its a tough job  it can wear on even the best of us  my father was always firmly in control  that he was but towards the end  look dexter  the system doesnt always work  sometimes they get away you know that  and that just got harder and harder for harry to deal with  i think thats what did him in in the end  what did  what am i missing here  he killed himself dexter  how  the autopsy showed an overdose of his heart medicine  that happens all the time people accidentally take the wrong dose  he called me the day before he died  he asked me to keep an eye on you and your sister  i didnt realize what that call meant until he was gone  so i made sure that autopsy never saw the light of day  i was looking out for the two of you like i said i would  im sorry dexter  why dont we go to the club and have a drink   we can talk some more  no  thank you  the legendary harry morgan  force for justice architect of all that i am  suicide  it doesnt make sense  special agent lundy   i have good news  i could use it what do you got  proof that james doakes  cant possibly be the bay harbor butcher  youre looking at the file of a stakeout james and i were on as partners   very detailed  we were doing surveillance when one of your victims  larry mueller went missing  james and i were holed up in a motel room 247 for two weeks  he didnt have time to piss much less abduct and murder a man  i respect your compassion for a friend and colleague  but im afraid this proves nothing  it proves that he was with me  its all here specific dates and times   these are my personal stakeout logs  and theyre very thorough  but i cant use them  no this is bullshit  you gotta be fucking kidding me you cant ignore legitimate evidence  i can and i will ignore it because you gave me no choice lady  those are your personal logs  and your credibility was compromised when you failed to report a phone call  from the subject of a goddamn fbi manhunt  it was a breach of protocol and ethics  and youre lucky i dont bring you up on charges  what really pisses me off  is you might be right but in trying to protect your friend  you blew the best shot we had of bringing him in from the cold  come back to me if you find evidence i can use  i smell  monster meat  i got ya  i tagged you   so  so youre a monster now   really  yeah  come on socio im sucking gas here  sorry angel my legs a little tight today  its too soon isnt it  for this for us  rita thats not it at all  then what is it  i always thought my father died of heart disease  and i just found out thats not true he committed suicide  god  i dont know why he would do that to himself   or me  baby  whatever harry did and why  i cant let it distract me from my mission  not when freedom is so close  found out where your cabin is on my way i want my fucking snow  no one appreciates uninvited houseguests  unless i can make the problem part of my solution  are you chad  it depends on what youre looking for  tim said to come to you  the rohypnol  roofies  you  youre just not my normal kind of customer  do stop talking  good luck with that  thanks for coming  i thought we should talk  i should talk  i mean  i yell a lot  and bitch and complain  and i keep expecting people to guess what i want but i never really say it  id like to hear it  you asked me what i thought would happen when the case ended  and the truth is  i had no fucking idea  and that was  exciting you know  the not knowing  what might happen what could be  it was all  possibility  and when you just assumed that we ended when the case ended  you crushed that  and i want it back  wanna know what i thought would happen when the case ended  what  i thought the novelty of my aarp discount would wear off  and youd get tired of me  my god  thats the sweetest thing youve ever said  on our way  what we got  a hit on one of doakes false ids at a carrental agency  make model and license plate  lets go  my hero  this place looks like brandnew  its my pleasure  though i feel a little loopy from the fumes  so how was your day at the beach  auri wore me out  you ever try and run in the sand  i never run youre a better man than me  im glad you think so  and how are dexter and rita  things are good for them  i mean  i think theyre gonna work things out  we going somewhere  well you know  ive been trying to hold off  but  i dont know i dont want to anymore  i think its time  i need you  you can have me  the thing is  i like it rough   who the fuck is that  some guy i picked up in a bar  hes a known murderer and your final victim   you gonna do what i think you are  theres no point in hiding it now  your life is going to rest in the hands  of the criminal justice system you put all your faith in   i wish you the best of luck  come on  we were just getting somewhere you and me you aint gotta do this  come on well find a way  im afraid this is the only way for me  excuse me i need to get my supplies  you are a very bad girl  im only just getting started baby  be right back  lila you want a beer  jesus  this is detective angel batista from miami metro homicide  i need an ambulance  there is no way people are gonna believe i did this shit  you were us special forces im sure you have done this  wartime circumstances heat of the battle  but never coldblooded  im sure that made things easier for you  morgan goddamn it you got a conscience  you said it yourself you go after killers  you take out killers i get that but this is some sickfuck ritual  you need help let me help you  dont worry i wont make you watch im not uncivilized  morgan no  you dont have to do this you dont have to kill this man  this man is a felon with a body count he brought it on himself  morgan turn him over to the law  i live by my fathers law  morgan dont do this  shit  sorry it had to go down like this but there really was no other way  sergeant  stay away  just stay away from me  ive heard those words before  three days before my fathers death  hey dad  look what i did  its juan ryness the pimp who killed that girl  i finally got him for you  dad whats wrong are you okay  just stay away please  stay away  it was me  the idea of a code was one thing  a grand idea  a noble cause  but the reality of it  harry walked in on what he created  and he couldnt live with himself  what morgan  what now  i killed my father  resync by pano
