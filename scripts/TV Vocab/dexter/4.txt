thrill posing his victim  in the middle of a 20000seat arena for all miami to see  to show us what hes capable of doing  what did i miss   fingertips  fuckin asshole thats my girl  this body belongs to the frozen fingertips in the truck  ladies and gentlemen  i give you tony tucci the icetruck killer  bullshit  of course i agree with my sister  but unlike her im not upset  hes still out there and im waiting  breathless  i find people around me are always making some kind of connection  like friendship or romance  but human bonds always lead to messy complications  commitment sharing  driving people to the airport  besides if i let someone get that close  theyd see who i really am  and i cant let that happen  so time to put on my mask   i need your expertise  i live to serve  excuse us fellas   interesting hand job  thats funny  it is  so how long you think its been there  this feels familiar  okay so how long has it been there  blood stopped pooling still wet couple hours at the most  what time was it found  a jogger called it in this morning about 730  no prints wiped clean real creep show huh  any sign of the rest of the body  just mr hand do you think this is our guys work  the icetruck killer  its hard to say theres blood thats different  plus its a male victim  havent seen that before  the cut appears to be almost delicate  you see between the first and second row of carpals  very surgical  check out what else he left behind  a little postcard to remember him by   how far is rand beach from here  this is rand beach  it was renamed petrie beach a few years ago  okay everybody  everybody say stinky feet  stinky feet  wait nobody move dexter were you smiling   no  okay well do another one  this time everybody smiles you too dex  yeah pretend youre burning ants

okay everybody ready one more time  stinky feet  yeah i just need to stop by my apartment to pick up a few labs  straight to the station after yeah thanks lieutenant  dexter morgan  this is your life  it is my new friend  the icetruck killer  when he broke into my apartment he took some time to get to know me  my life  my secrets  have even brought in manpower from other counties  in an effort to expedite the search  officially mr tucci has not been charged with any crime  then tell the fucking governor to free up funds for overtime  i mean the more guys i got out there the sooner we find tucci  kelly ill get back to you  whats wrong  fingerprint i d came back on that hand from the beach  it belongs to tony tucci  your icetruck killer suspect  what  wait a minute  no no no no no way  no way i mean this   this has to be a mistake  the mistake maria was unleashing a highprofile manhunt  before you had all the facts  fuck  okay this doesnt mean that tucci is not the killer  dont  just just dont  you wanted to be on tv  well get ready  cause the press will annihilate us for this  well be lucky if tuccis mother doesnt file a lawsuit  all right  you go talk to that woman do your mea culpas  if we handle this right  maybe we can mitigate the fallout  t om  im the last person she wants to see  i called her son a killer  and nows your chance to make it right  so laguerta screwed the pooch on this one huh  im taking point  you can help by getting all non essentials off the beach  secure and separate any witnesses all right  will do what did the captain say did he make her cry  just  control the fucking beach angel  i knew tucci wasnt the killer i knew it  laguerta whipped up a manhunt  for a rentacop  man i wish i could have been there to see the captain rip her a new one  morgan calm down  laguerta insulted the real killers intelligence  and now hes getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy  you see all these people over here   yeah  what are they  potential witnesses  and what do we do with potential witnesses morgan  we  we interview them got it  where is he  the rest of him  were  were still looking  the entire force is looking were making every effort  are you sure its tony because  yes  im afraid so  mrs tucci  i said some very harsh things about your son  thank you  thank you for what   for coming to tell me in person  for gods sake please

metatarsus  the wound is circular  again almost surgical  and theres blood guy gives us body after body with no blood   why hes making a switch now  hes trying to send a message  one thats more

captain  he tried to pull ricky out of his assignment  but ricky didnt want to come out  of course not his job was to bring down guerrero  it was his job to protect his wife  rickys the motherfucker

exercise every now and  im sorry is this funny  no no no its its sad  but youre funny look at you all tough  im gonna call the police i can do that  theres nothing you can do  the cops will tell me to keep him quiet  and ill say i will and then  theyll leave and hell go back to doing what he does  but youre funny  unlike harry my new friend doesnt place much value in blending in  he wants me to see who he is and what he does  everything about him is brazen authentic  what does that make me  crap   you okay man  no  hey dont let this bastard get to you  youre the best blood expert in the state

are you sure thats not a butterfly  well it does kind of look like a bug   this cant be right  whats up  you see that you see it  i dont know what do i see  the blood flow in the hand suggested the heart was still pumping   when it was severed  mean son of a bitch no doubt  but look at the foot its the same blood flow  plus the lividity look its the same bruising same ashen color  same level of decomposition as the hand the day we found it  but we found them a day apart  i know  dios santo  l t you got to listen to him  its the guard tucci i think hes alive  what  are you talking about  the icetruck killer is keeping him alive to perform amputations  tuccis alive  both limbs were taken from a live body  and we found them 24 hours apart thats not all  tell them dexter  if the hand came
