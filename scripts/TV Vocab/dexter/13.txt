and look at what you did  please you have to understand  trust me i definitely understand  children i could never do that not like you   why  i have standards   you better be a cop  no forensics   they found another hooker  another  thats the 3rd one in five months  theres no blood near the body at all  its the weirdest thing you ever saw  ive never seen such clean dry neat looking dead flesh  how does the killer get rid of the blood  i think this is a friendly message  kind of like hey wanna play  and yes i wanna play  i really really do  whats this sick son of a bitch trying to tell us  not us me  interesting hand job  you think this is our guys work  the ice truck killer  this feels familiar  when he broke into my apartment he took some time to get to know me  my life my secrets he knows  hes not corrupting the happy hallmark images of my youth  hes revealing the ugly truth behind them  son there are people out there who do really bad things  but of course you have to learn how to spot them  but i can teach you  the code of harry my foster father is satisfied  so how the hell was your date with rita last night  great  shes perfect because rita is  in her own way as damaged as me   i want  a normal life  yeah a normal life  the killer is an artist  you give me the fucking creeps you know that  yeah i know sorry about that  why in a building full of cops  is doakes  the only one who gets the creeps from me  i want you and rita to meet my boyfriend  dex rudys different  i feel safe with him i think im falling for him  i waited a long time to meet you  dads coming home

backyard  all i want is for you to look for a shoe  its missing im telling you  dexter is not who you think he is  do i have the pleasure of your company this weekend  weve had a major break in the ice truck killer case  debra morgan  will you marry me  yes yes   wheres my sister  took her code 12  left about an hour ago  how did you not know who i was  i think a real cop would  at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was  hunting  where the fuck are you im here at work  and youre not i need to talk to you  do not see rudy until you find me  youre connected to this i dont know how but im gonna find out  and some of what i find is gonna stick to your ass  i was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me  well sure thing  its the crime scene where harry found me  this is what he wanted me to find all along  hes showing me where to go  laura moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw  what is in that report that harry didnt want me to see  what he saw in that cargo container changed him  you were left there for days starving  in blood 2 inches thick  you remember now  i have a brother  a real brother  i didnt even know you existed  imagine how i felt  when i tracked you down and found out you were exactly like me  you cant be a killer and a hero  it doesnt work that way  why me dex whyd he choose me  youre just lucky i guess  i was so scared  what am i one of your victims now  no youre not a trophy  but you need to be put down  sorry  i drove away a brother who accepts me  for a foster father who betrayed me  im not alone and harry kept it from me  doakes always sensed i was hiding something  now he knows  my devil danced with his demon and the fiddlers tune is far from over  subtitlonelemonheadsixe  tonights the night  and its going to happen again and again  has to happen  its not what i want  for what i want doesnt matter  this is the only way i know how to survive  im coiled and ready to strike  although a spare

eight days sixteen hours and  twelve minutes have passed since i killed my brother  in that entire time i havent had a single night to myself  sergeant doakes makes sure of that  he follows me

dex  you pictured it didnt you  hey striker  we need you locked down tonight huh  were playing the alley cats  im a little tense angel  but ill try my best not to let the team down  try peso try  you gotta think positive bro  cause what we think creates the world around us  its all about energy and interconnectedness  i mean you gotta think positive  angel lost someone too  when his wife left him  now hes going toward the light  searching for answers  he found one on an oprah rerun  i wish it were that easy for me  and we just got to direct it to manifest what we want  alright  dude just bowl a strike so we can go have some fun at the strip clubs  i want to see a real 710 split  i wish i could have fun  with doakes tailing me my lifes been all jekyll and no hyde  no moonlit play dates no

emmanuel azua  jeanphilippe peguero  nono baptiste  i didnt kill them  i cast them  and then a remarkable coincidence  they each die of respiratory failure with fluid in their lungs  i guess murder is one way to make your curses come true  good for business  what what was that  just the next part of the ritual  how did you administrate the ricin poison to your victims  i am the one with the power in these hands  thats not entirely accurate  those who believe in me shall be free  knock it off  how do you poison them  not me  madulli  the petro spirit  told me put the powder  in the aguardiente bottles that they buy from me  and i did it  thank you jimmy  my rituals almost complete  madulli curses you  you  im afraid madullis a little late to the party on that one  appreciate your helping me

bullshit  what the hell were you really doing in here  the tits are right there  but in ten years youve never rented a single porn title  how would you know  call me an office crazy but your humbling

wounds on the forearms are long and linear  i can make out bevelled margins a machete did this  the machetes are weapons of choice of the 29th st kings  the victim was in the gang judging from that tattoo  we think the body was carried from a nearby location  i found a real good blood trail coming down from the road  lens  just make sure we check the docks lifts for criminal records  its possible this victim was killed by one of these boat owners out here  or maybe it was just an easyaccess spot to dump a corpse at night  no light poles and the freeway exit ramp is just a block away

points for dying  dying  dad i dont wanna die  im just trying to figure out some way to feel alive  i dont normally seek human contact in times of failure  but then i dont normally experience failure

altercation  its a fight  he was angry and he got into a fight  now i have to figure out how to tell my children their fathers dead  and i could have helped him  how  how could you have helped him he was in prison  thats right dexter  it happened in prison  paul was in prison  that was his own fault  was it  you okay rita said you got in a bar brawl tonight  you gotta see this  mount pleasant at 81 and salem  theyve been playing it on the news all night  two treasure hunters made a ghastly discovery today  when they stumbled on what appears to be an underwater graveyard  in a crevasse off the coast of miami  theres bodies in those bags  the butchered bodies were submerged inside these heavy duty garbage bags  authorities have located at least 30 bags so far  but around the clock salvage efforts are still underway  did you hear that  thirty bags do you know what that means  there might be a new mass murderer out there  way worse than the ice truck killer  maybe i can finally get some peace  isnt that great  its amazing
