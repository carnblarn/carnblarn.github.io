                   previously on dexter  you need to kill it   no ii cant   whats the real reason youre stalling on killing trinity   i still have things to learn from him   judging from the spray were looking at somebody tall  over six feet  he moved the arm  for a reason   that smudge you found at the crime scene  cremated human remains   we got the killers goddamn dna   the killer is related to the human remains  same family the same dna   he keeps his family with him all the time  vera mitchell sister of arthur mitchell  found dead in a bathtub  this is arthur mitchell at his core  is there something in his dna  that lets him keep a family some magic gene im missing   i just got the official goahead from laguerta  to open a trinity killer investigation   whats that mean   i realized if i pitched the entire trinity theory  and i added that he also shot me and lundy  look like a fucking lunatic so i boiled it down  to the bludgeonings   i am no longer seeing lieutenant laguerta   we broke up officially   if i find out this is bullshit  there will be consequences  severe careerending consequences   who are you   im the person whos going to keep you  from killing any more women   i didnt fucking kill them  because of my pictures  those women will live on forever   nothing lasts forever      isnt that  farrows assistant  i just arrested him for the murder of estrella carazo   but no i thought   yeah at first it looked like farrow but this is airtight  we got dna evidence we got everything   i killed an innocent man   so i made a mistake  it couldve happened to anyone  well any murderer  not that murderers typically care  whether their victims are innocent or not  then why is it eating at me  jonathan farrow s and m photographer  abuser of women asshole but not a killer  not up to harrys code  yet i killed him  now im  uncomfortable  it shouldve been arthur mitchell on my table   trinity shooter of my sister  i shouldve  no no shouldves i dont do shouldves  thats not me    this isnt me   aah shit   i just need to stop thinking about it   jonathon farrow  originally a suspect now possibly a victim   it was a mistake for fucks sake   farrow disappeared right before his assistant  timothy brand confessed to murdering those models  missing persons has been investigating  and now theyre passing it on to us   you think brand killed farrow   maybe he found out what brand was up to its hard to say  soderquist yale stay with farrow   brand probably turned him into gator bait   i wish i could take comfort  that my crime has been pinned on brand  but i cant   what is wrong with you    i dont know   okay moving on morgan  what do we have on your bludgeonings   maybe thisll cheer you up   not if youre making headway on trinity   weve got a serial bludgeoner  the victims are all men in their 40s  ive got cases dating back 30 years  which most likely puts our bludgeoner in his 50s or 60s  the break in the case came with the discovery  of the human ash he left behind  along with his own saliva  read dna   youre welcome just doing my job   the killer leaves the ash as his sickass signature  making his vics point at it post mortem  i cant be sure all of these are ash marks  but the fingerpointing indicates  a strong possibility that ahh howd that get in there   nowhoa could you go back  go back  this isnt a bludgeoning   no   yet the victims finger seems to be pointing towards a smudge  ash   dont do it deb   uh  yeah probably   when you presented this case to me  you said it was limited to a bludgeoner  so how about we hear all of it detective morgan   its gonna sound insane  i hope   all right i found possible smudges  in several old bathtub killings  also several jumper suicides  and thats the pattern  bathtub jumper bludgeon  all in close succession  one cycle of three vics every year or so  possibly for 30 years  different cities different states  its a trinity of victims  which is why frank lundy called him the trinity killer   this is an fbi case  the fbi never bought it   yet were supposed to   lundy came to miami to hunt this guy  i think he got too close  and i think it got him killed and me shot   so this trinity killer did that to you   come on laguerta say its farfetched   go on   great like i need you people getting in my way  well trinity is past his due date  this just confirms it   dex  can you believe it   yeah you really did it   i kept lundys legacy alive  i even got the bosses on board   detective morgan my office  is that a commendation i smell   go get em tiger  ess  tigress   dex hey buddy   keep walking not in the mood   halftime   its called lunch buddy   off campus as usual     i really do need to stab something       the trinity killer  this is good  theres no question of his guilt  and i could use some certainty   hey jonah how those wheels holding up   like a dream mr butler  like a real nice dream  kyle  hey what brings you here this fine day   ah just checking in  you know after the  deer  want to make sure youre okay   oh thats kind of you but ive put it out of my mind  no need to dwell   you can just do that   no no no smooth circular motion son  and the

i know     tampa what the hells in tampa   something sciencey  a crime scene is basically a microclimate  subject to so many variables  in the world of blood spatter  those variables can mean the difference  between good science and the guilty going free  everything from the anomalous effects of barometric pressure  on particulate liquids in a high humidity environment  to the ionization of   point please   oh  meteorological conference tampa   if i let you go will you stop talking   you see learning even more about hemoglobin dispersion  and the magnetic effects of lightning  in the case of severe thunderstorms  could prove invaluable  because it can all be considered causal  in the determination of bloodstain analysis   oh  is that it   thats all i could come up with   well iit sounds like youre very excited  about this conference   not to mention how it will look  when my salary revue comes up  we could start paying for your college   i love your dedication  to work to this

oldwhiteguy quotient   theres got to be something else we can do  some other angle   uh dna sweep  we could do a targeted dna sweep  of white males 60ish in the miami metro area   you know how much work that is  ive got a big weekend planned as in twins   you got twins lined up   not yet but thats the plan  besides the aclu will shut this down  the minute word gets out   and they always do  you

sister died   kids dont need to hear any more about that   bob they should learn to speak the truth   i think they know how to speak the truth   we all need to confess our mistakes  so we can go into the light unburdened  thats what kyle taught me yesterday     not on purpose   it was such a revelation to me  when he told me what he did  huh   were leaving   what about your tuna melt   these folks want to enjoy their family time alone  lets go   that was rather rude   yeah sorry im just not as open as you are   its the remorse you need to shed it   believe me im trying  but theres only one thing thatll do it   whats that  giving  is it okay if we stop by a hardware store  i want to pick up some things to donate  to the four walls build tomorrow   thats an excellent idea      morgan   lieutenant   what are you doing   nothing  why were you singing   i wasnt singing i was humming  people have been known to hum   not without reason  you happy about something   are you hiding something   are you      oh  dissolving stitches my ass  fuck me  mother shit fuck  how tall was my shooter  these wounds have a trajectory thats totally fucking straight  jesus masuka theyre just tits   but theyre yours perky perfect   grow the fuck up and tell me how tall my shooter is   uh if it was the trinity killer  then hes about 64   up  that puts you at about his height  so if youre trinity  how exactly do you shoot me and get wounds like this   casings and gsr from your shirt put you about  about five feet away  so im 64  and the vast majority of shooters  hold their guns like this  unless hes trying not to attract attention  then like this  either way  to hit you on the side from up here  i got to shoot you with a downward trajectory   theres nothing downward about this its completely level   unless im kneeling  but then again im like 60 and i got to be mobile   plus lundy wouldve reacted  to some old guy kneeling behind me  i remember his face exactly   so im not kneeling  then how tall is he   my height approximately   oh fucking fuck  then it wasnt trinity   nope   then who the fuck shot me   nothing like the spirit of charity  to make the heart right   about time i gave back   its a good call with the plastic sheeting by the way  this is florida you never know when its gonna rain     ah compadre i dont know about you but im bushed   were kindred spirits you and i  keep doing good work   oh i will   just go to sleep  no more surprises       good enough   you know whats great   your mango salsa    wine  nine months without it sucked     you

 i was a dressoverthehead party girl  oh god did i just say that      you must think im   totally charming   i umi better start cleaning up   yeah let me let me help you   no no its getting late  im sure you want to get home   right ill uh get the kids        where the fuck did you go   hes on foot  with his tools  the four walls build  a little early but walking distance  empty no security  just me arthur and a little m99  no more confessions no more good deeds  and no more fucking remorse  what are you doing  no youre mine       this isnt how you die   let go   why keep him alive just to kill him  but as long as its by my hand   gotcha gotcha   hold on  give me your hand      this is his solution to remorsesuicide  thats why he could unburden himself  he knew this was next  will it be my only solution someday   i thought god sent you so that i could save you  but god had another plan   so did i   he sent you to save me   not exactly  youre a hero   thank you     so much for anonymity  arthur mitchell you just got a reprieve   so the trinity killer didnt shoot you and lundy   nope   someone masukas size shot you   yep   and thats all we got to go on lundys case   thats it   well the upside is theres no longer  a conflict of interest for you in the trinity case   you mean i can work it again   thank christ no more backseat driving   nobody knows this case better than you  youre taking lead   motherfucker really  well what about lundys case  thats my case now  dont worry im gonna find the shithead that shot you   oh oh whoa   oh are you okay  im fim fine   you okay      well were done here  were done   morgan update the squad at 300 please   glad that didnt happen last night   any regrets   that we didnt have breakfast together   at least ill get trinity  promise   ive killed an innocent man and ive saved a guilty one  i wont make that mistake again  is that the purpose of remorse  to keep you from repeating mistakes   youre watching me   im just concerned   no need i was confused before   but youre not anymore   no embarrassed perhaps  in fact id appreciate it  if youd think of this weekends events as a  a little accident   you stepped off a roof   it was a mistake  we all make them  dont worry  your accident will never be spoken of by me  to err is human  little early for a drunkdriving checkpoint   looks like one of debras dna sweeps   stand over here sir please   you sir pull over here   step on out of the car sir please   yeah i heard about this on the radio  the police are looking for some huge serial killer  they have his dna theyre looking for a match   sounds scary   exactly how much do you want to live arthur   i think this gentleman in the red car has the right idea  this line is endless  what say we take the scenic route   yeah sure arthur   a changed man at peace with himself  maybe only monsters feel no regret  if erring is human then remorse must be too  wait does that make me human  huh
