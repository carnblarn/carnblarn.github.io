bettermatched than i thought  fucking animals  god bless america  taking the extra time to kill valerie may have been illadvised  my life has always been a sequence of carefully planned moments  but

staying with cousins i had a cop bring her in  why scratch the number in the floor  next of kin in case something happened to her  guys like castillo are ruthless they prey on families  he was holding mariel and six others captive at a salvage yard  that explains the garage  and if the relatives dont pay the release fee  the coyote would dump their ass overboard  cocksuckers make me sick come on  mariel estos son mis amigos que yo te dije  sargento doakes y la detective morgan puede sentar  mariel when was the last time you saw jorge castillo  cundo fue la ultima vez que t viste a jorge castillo  cuando me encerr con los otros despus de bajarnos del barco  when he locked her and the other refugees up  after pulling them from the boat  no tenamos comida ni agua  un hombre trat de escapar jorge lo agarr y lo golpe  they went without food and water  some guy tried to escape but he was beaten by jorge   howd she get free  cmo escap  alguien abri la puerta al garaje y nos escapamos  somebody opened the door to the garage  cuando los agarren espero que los hagan sufrir mucho  especialmente esa concha que nos trat como perro  she said when we find them  to make them suffer for what they did  especially that concha that treated her like a dog  concha ah got you  fuck me the wife was in on it  ask if she knows the little boy social services picked up  y quin era el nio pequeo que estaba con usted  qu nio yo nunca vi un nio  she never saw a boy  no hair no fibers cod exsanguination  so far so good   youre hovering  keep reading   what am i looking for   wait for it  this is a prelim i dont have time   m fucking 99  etorphine hydrochloride  an animal tranquilizer more powerful than morphine  it causes total paralysis  that mark on her neck kept bugging me  so

 everything okay   paul called after you left  paul whos paul  my soontobe ex hes already out of jail   overcrowding can you believe it  every time something goes just a little bit right  something like this happens he wants to come to astors party    what did you tell him  id have to think about it  but even if i say no he wont listen he never does  can you  can you come over tonight  i dont

bye  check the marinas  find jorge castillos boat  well search the house  wheres laguerta  trying to bring that kid in for a sketch  sketch  he told social services that some guy saved him from the bad lady  valerie castillo  it sounds like she got exactly what she had coming to her  personally id shake this guys hand  yeah  you say that now  found his passport  god  i feel like i need a shower just looking at this douche bag  well keep searching  phone records bank accounts credit cards  maybe the wife got greedy and thats why he killed her  maybe  this morning at the salvage yard what was that thing by the car  what thing  before you opened the trunk you tried to cockblock me  i was just looking out for my team  i didnt see you looking out for laguerta   i would if shed asked  i didnt ask  fine  next time just get your ass shot   its possible our guy left town  if he even did it   what if we have a copycat killer  thats a bit of a stretch dont you think  just hear me out  what if the person who killed valerie castillo was trying  to bleed her out like the icetruck killer  but didnt know how  she wasnt a hooker  but she was killed someplace else  dumped and laid out in a ritualistic manner just like all the others  except she wasnt in pieces  but she had cuts on her neck  im just saying with all the media coverage on the icetruck killer  its possible  what do you suggest morgan  let me work up a profile just in case jorge doesnt pan out  fine whatever  thats the second time youve made that face who are you avoiding  we got one more stop to make  nothing lasts forever  just ask a ford pinto  eventually most serial killers get caught  theres really not much of a retirement plan  but it cant end like this its too soon  im not ready  he saw me  whats this  youve been asking whos been calling my mom lives here  did you forget your laundry  shes been on me to stop by for dinner so im stoppin by  and heres the plan we go in  we eat we out before the cheesecake you got it  im what your exit strategy  look you can stay out here if you want  that gives me a better excuse to leave earlier or  you can come in and have some free food its your call  shit  my sisters are here too  fucking family reunion  so this john comes out of nowhere hes got me by the throat  i cant reach around and get my gun  and i see he has a nipple ring  i rip that fucker out like its a grenade pin  morgan  oh im sorry im sorry cop mouth  were used to it  when james graces his family with this presence  some of us dont work at a bank  please first words out of my baby brothers mouth were  got milk motherfucker  oh okay now thats enough all of you  that security guard on the news is gonna be all right  if someone did a hatchet job on me like that id cash it all in  yeah tonys doing okay  the hospitals setting him up with some prosthetics  i dont know hes just got this spirit about him  the guys missing body parts  because of this icetruck killer asshole  and hes still hitting on me  thats because men only think with one body part  and that one was not cut off  ma  well its the damn truth  morgan come on we got a case to solve  oh are you sure honey i got some cheesecake in the fridge  yeah were sure  you know  i would love some cheesecake bit  you can wait in the car thats your call  hell wait   ill do the dishes  ill help you  ooh im sorry  i wonder in time if theyll even remember me  other than the man who broke their mothers heart  ill be breaking their hearts too  he is their father  they have a right to know  hes been released right  yeah sure  yeah even if i tell paul not to come hell show up here eventually  i know him  everythings been going so good at work  with you  i dont know what to do  hes really got a hold on you doesnt he  paul  always had a temper but when he was using  he said if i  left he would find us and hurt the kids  somehow i thought that by staying i was protecting them  cody doesnt remember the worst of it but  astor  she was the one who called the police the last time  she was protecting me  youre not that woman anymore  youre stronger than that now  if their dad shows up well deal with it together  dads coming home  can he sleep in my room mom can he mom  i shouldnt even be here  rita will be devastated if im arrested  her husband was a crackhead her boyfriends a serial killer  its kind of hard not to take that personally  better get inside son storms on its way  why didnt you tell me what you are dex  any last words  figures  i dont have bad dreams  when i sleep all of me sleeps  nothing ever goes bump in dexters night  ive never felt a moment of remorse  doubt regret  whats happening to me  if my back wasnt against the wall id almost feel guilty  for hacking into masukas email  once i got past all the porn it was easy  and there i am  dr patrick bateman  so wholesome so inconspicuous  harry would frown upon destroying evidence  but he never wanted me to get caught either  what are you doing in here  my computer went down  i was just checking some email  can you take a look at this for me  copycat killer  i worked all night on that profile  id like to give it to laguerta but i want to make sure its good enough  im honored  the similar manner in which the victims body was displayed suggests this killer  feels a connection to the icetruck killer  excited by what hes doing  the cut on the victims cheek while not fatal  appears to be a signature of sorts  because of the lack of evidence collected from the crime scene  the suspect may be familiar  with law enforcement or forensics procedure  whyd you quit youre getting to the good stuff  let me guess   single white male mid30s lives alone  disconnected from his emotions  its a little textbook dont you think  but it totally fits this case  youre trying to make it fit  my advice  keep this to yourself  really  deb youre new to homicide this blows up in your face  youve given laguerta the excuse  shes been looking for to send you back to vice  no  im on to something here i feel it  like one of your hunches  way to have my back  wheres your sister  debra what the hell do you think youre doing  how did you get into my cabinet  you hide the key in the pantry  on the top shelf  you and your brother know  never  to touch my guns unless its under my direct supervision  but i was being really careful i mean  i was only shooting at the cans and the bottles  and im really good like dexter  and now we can all go hunting together  im disappointed in you debra  grab your things  thanks a lot  starting this morning we have cadets from the academy  going over every inch of the salvage yard  those days i dont miss  the kid we found yesterday  saw someone abduct valerie castillo from that yard  because he didnt recognize a photo of jorge castillo  lieutenant laguerta is bringing him in to attempt a sketch  come on sweetheart  lets take the seatbelt off  there you go come on  come on sweetheart  you want to go inside to see the nice lady  come on sweetie lets go  thanks for bringing him by  hola oscar  t quieres venir conmigo  normally i wouldnt approve of something like this  but youve made quite an impression  you have kids  no  i was like him once   a stranger in a strange place  left to grow up with strangers  all for a better life  well police lieutenant  id say youve done okay   any luck with the family  no he talks about an uncle roberto  he just uses the first name  maybe well have some luck on our end  i hope so  i hate to send another one of these kids into foster care  thank you  bye sweetheart  meanwhile well follow up on the dea list  of m99 buyers  that would include vets doctors  animal control even circuses  be thorough check everyone  masuka what do we have on the home and the boat  still processing sir  if it turns up the husband is a dead end  then were looking at a new suspect folks  morgan  any ideas  dont do it deb  the last thing i need right now  is to be profiled for all of miami metro  we could be looking at someone whos inspired  by the icetruck killer a copycat  if so the suspect is probably familiar with forensic procedures  i have a profile id be happy to show it to you  ill be in my lab  hello dex  oscar  el hombre que viste era como yo o ms delgado  mi hijito est bien cuntanos  cuntanos lo que t viste esa noche   ill be right back  no  est bien me quedo aqu  i forgot how much i loved pastelitos growing up  he just needed a little reminder of home  i was barely his age when i came over with my family  i threw up the whole damn way  quieres ms  cinco  go get the artist i think somebodys ready  save me some  no dice que no  cinco no puede pero tres s   no es 5 es 10  10  te digo que t hablas con el seor cuando el venga y entonces  s yo te doy 10 lo que t quieras 20    50  50  did you thank mrs carrol  for picking you up from school for me  yes  so what do you think  everything okay  you want to talk out it  holly blake and ashley said they cant come to my party  honey thats not true  i spoke with their moms last week  its all codys fault  he couldnt keep his mouth shut about dad getting out of jail   did not  you told everyone  i have to know  dexter  thank god  my arms asleep  how long have you two been like this  half an hour  i was afraid id wake him if i moved  at that age when theyre out theyre out  you could brush his teeth and he wouldnt wake up  here lift up his head ill slide this underneath  oh thanks  what are you doing here  im waiting on some lab work i had some time to kill  go ahead we didnt get very far hes so tired  were gonna pick it up again tomorrow  its only a matter of time  before we know what this little guy saw  if you um here  you want help or not  i have a hair or something stuck on my lens  luckily youre in good hands  i traded my glasses in for contacts in high school  boys  yeah what i really needed was tits  i had winnie the poohs on my bras until i was 16 as you can see   not a whole lots changed since then  morgan  try not to blink okay  okay okay ill do it  ill do it  let me ask you something  your brothers adopted right  yeah my dad found him at a crime scene  how did the department feel about harry getting  personally involved in a case  it didnt seem to be a problem my parents never talked about it much  oh but still raising a boy its a lot of work no  dex god no  i got in more trouble than he did he was the perfect one  here i think i see it  theres the bastard  thanks  let me ask you a question  why do you have it in for me  youre loud youre impulsive and  you constantly question authority  fair enough  i hear you have an interesting theory on   honey what is it  sweetie  im sorry it was an accident  its all right these things happen  go get changed and ill fix the bed  mommy  is it okay if i didnt have my party  its only a matter of time before that boy finishes telling  the police who he saw that night at the salvage yard   me  once the sketch is finished there will be no place left to hide  if i want any chance of survival i have to get rid of it all  i have to let go  alex timmons  sniper  yes i did it is that what you want to hear  gene marshall  arsonist  have you ever watched someone burned alive  cindy landon  black widow  ill fuck you if you let me go  such fond memories of them all  they all accepted their fate in their own way  now its time for me to do the same  valerie castillo  my last victim  hes not angry thats not what this is about  hes testing me  i was wrong the whole time  my playmate saw an opportunity  to paint me into a corner to see if id find my way out  if id fight to survive  if you have a wellpreserved sample  transferring a dry drop of blood is relatively easy  almost as easy as it was lifting jorge castillos fingerprints  from his boat and putting them on this knife  just got off the phone with the fbi  now for the hard part  i wanted to see what their computers would spit out  i crossreferenced my profile with the icetruck killer list   how about we hold off till we get a sketch  take it from there  i know i know i want to get a head start on this  we could look these over at lunch  my treat  you never give up do you  thank your mom for dinner the other night  cant remember the last time  i met a guys family and they actually liked me  you held your own  most people dont get a dirty word in edgewise  with my sisters around the table  in our house every thursday night was pancake night   a morgan tradition  i miss that kind of stuff you know  i found something  the wifes blood youre sure  this was found in the castillos bedroom hamper  we check all the clothing items that come in  sometimes because of sheer volume that takes time  it doesnt prove anything  not by itself but  ive been reexamining the video footage i took from that morning  notice the cuts along the carotid arteries  theyre long deep  valerie castillo bled to death in minutes  no shit  the person who did this  wasnt trying to emulate the icetruck killer he was  in a hurry  he was probably afraid of getting caught  most killers are  except if this was a copycat he wouldnt be in a rush  he would savor his first kill  he would control the precise moment valerie castillo died instead of  just letting her bleed out  this is all too  passive  have you completely ruled out the husband  why are you doing this  the boy said he didnt recognize jorge castillo in any of the photos  well he was a dehydrated and traumatized 7yearold  left to fend for himself for days in a salvage yard  you really think its the husband  hes a deepsea fisherman most know how to use a knife  plus hes still missing  have you finished your search of the salvage yard  ill have them send the cadets out again  hey im sorry  i know how hard you worked on that profile  no dex i really dont think you do  how long are you grounded for  two months  deb i had to tell him  no dex you didnt  you could have kept your fucking mouth shut  dad was worried about you and so was i  well now you can spend more time together  im not stupid dexter thats always what you wanted  no its not  deb youre my sister  no i am not and he is my father  there are so many times i swear dexter  i wish he wouldnt have brought you home  dexter i am so sorry  i really really didnt mean it like that  here  i thought you might want that  youre a better shot than me anyway   hello  paul hey its me   look we need to talk  sure thing  i know you want to see astor but i mean  the kids are doing so well now  maybe  maybe it would be a good idea if you  dont come to the party   i just want  she is my daughter too rita  i have every right to be there  you know what im sorry  im sorry but i have full custody now  and you cant just drop in on us like this anymore  now i checked and the restraining order is still in effect  so if you step one foot on this property  the first call im gonna make is to the police  the second call is to your parole officer  i need the sergeant  morgan  ill be right there  est listo  ya lo tir  oscarsito  ito roberto  the uncle called our office this morning he lives in tampa  thats great he should be with family  can i take him home  were good  thank you  thank you for finding him huh  hes a very special boy  i know  cudate  lt you need to see this   you okay  these contacts  dios mo  wrecks like this are usually sold for scrap  the husband stashes a knife inside  and lets a demo crew shred the truck  before we find it  no more murder weapon  theres blood  want to bet its the wifes  its always the husband you were right all along  shake it off morgan homicide takes time  deb will forgive me eventually  thats who she is  bighearted  kind  nothing like me   laguerta thought you should see this  what you got   that kid oscar swears this is who he saw   son of a bitch  dex  okay i gave them jorges sock a knife with his prints  and a drop of his wifes blood  forensics trifecta like that  should trump a childs drawing  i hope   too fucking weird  jesus christ saved this kid  on his own for as long as oscar was  whos to say he didnt  when did lighting candles become more fun than blowing them out  nice turnout  i called all the moms to assure them  that paul would not be making an appearance  do astor and cody know that you told their dad not to come  after presents  ready  make a wish baby  just dont tell anybody or it wont come true  it already came true dads not here   i want the middle piece  okay  i was wrong about birthdays  maybe the reason to celebrate them is what they offer   the hope of living to see another one  the thing about deb forgiving me   i better give her a few more days  i barely escaped getting caught this time  i realize now my days are numbered  so i better make the most of them  all along i thought this was a game  my alter ego and i were playing  but relationships change  evolve  and this ones getting deep  like harry said in my dream  the storms on its way
