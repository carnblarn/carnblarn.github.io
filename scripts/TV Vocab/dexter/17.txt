register  something this brutal is personal  want to meet your prime suspect  he has fins  should we call the super friends for help  no i got it covered  i found traces of blood here on the base  ill bring it back to my lab confirm its the murder weapon  got a next of kin we can notify   denny was like a loner  whos that  the dark defender  denny had this great idea to put a spin  on that vigilante serial killer we got running around  definitely has a nicer ring to it than the bay harbor butcher  im conducting an interview here  denny was trying to set up the dark defender as a graphic novel  stalker of the night his blade of vengeance turns wrong into right  i need some air  thanks a lot  the dark defender  no miamis too hot for all that leather  the first time i got high i was 15  no thats not right i was 14  no wait  i was definitely 15 because it was my freshman year  i remember now because i was  dating susie mitchell  we broke up cause i called her by her sister sharons

you thought maybe you werent  saving your mother in this dream  maybe you were saving yourself  thats not what happened  dont be so sure  when i got clean all the seriously fuckedup reasons i used  in the first place began to surface  this could be where your addiction started  i hope whoever did it got the bloody chair  there were 3 men  i dont know what happened to them  if these guys are behind bars you need to confront them  if theyre dead hell go piss on their graves  but you need to do whatever it takes so you can get closure  how else do you expect to get better  i never expected to get better  my meth labs in the sock drawer   this looks bad doesnt it  yeah  the cute panties help  im trying to get to know you better  by rifling through my stuff  im retarded  and youve been so great

broom it might have rabies  oh its right there get it  watch it  careful  alright  he got it  my hero  alright kids shows over come on lets get dressed for school  so any armadillos in michigan  we didnt have any in florida  now its like an invasion armadillos attack  you think youre charming dont you  im sure it probably works for you most of the time it did for paul  i know what you are  confused  i found these in a drawer  tell me  why would rita print out narcotics anonymous literature  if pauls dead  because recently i entered the program  i knew it   i would never hurt rita like paul did  im not gonna give you that chance  its just a matter of time before you pull her under just like he did  have you discussed any of this with rita  no but i will if you dont do the right thing here  if you truly care about this family like you say you do  you will let my daughter and those sweet children go  the algae on the rocks was exposed to both zinc and lead  therere only 3 marinas near bay harbor  which have restricted water flow  that would account for such high levels of these specific pollutants  turkey creek sunset keys and coral cove  anyone familiar with these marinas  coral cove is where my dad kept our family boat  my brother uses the slip now ill bet half the force has boats out there  its one of the few marinas left thats affordable on a cops salary  morgan and i will take that one  sodoquist and lee turkey creek is yours  and hill and ramos youve got sunset keys  the rest of you stay here with detective batista  when the team reports in relay the information back to me  if our killers boat is out there lets find it  sorry it took so long couldnt find any other crime scene files  probably lost in storage somewhere thats what i was able to dig up  just one file  there were 3 men arrested for those murders  ones deceased ones doing life without possibility  and thats the only one thats still an open case  santos jiminez  whys it an open case  jiminez turned states evidence went into witness protection  theres a business address in there for him  i guess after 34 years  he figures all the people who want him dead are long gone  he figured wrong  if you cant find what you need theres audio tapes referenced with this file   tapes  yes see that notation  there was a criminal informant working a cocaine bust from the inside   ill take those too  ok  harry always said never make things personal  it clouds your judgement  but ive been living in a fog way too long  today is friday september 28 1973  this is detective harry morgan   dad  case file  i cant fucking do this anymore  i have to know when the next shipments coming in laura  laura moser  my mother  i cant take this anymore  harry im so scared  everythings going to be ok you just need to calm down  i took the cocaine as evidence just like you asked isnt it enough  if we want estrada and his men behind bars  we have to catch them in the act at the shipyard  hes gonna find out and then hes gonna kill me  harry listen to me  i think someone may have followed us to the park  if we were followed i would have noticed  i just need you to hold out a little longer  this will all be over soon   i need to pick up brian at school  i wont let anything happen to you  or your boys  you have my word  harry broke his word  he wasnt called to that crime scene by chance  it was his case  laura moser was his informant  harry knew my mother  our suspect is 62 380 pounds  hispanic drives a 1971 ford pickup  circulate his dmv photo   ive got good news  me too  turns out our vic foster he had a blog  he was in some online geek flame war with a guy calling himself corndude  the da finally signed off on your review  there wont be any charges  this corndudes real name is benjamin alvaro  anyone in the shoot team talk to you about counseling  why the fuck would i need counseling  cause you shot a man last week james  thats two shootings in less than 6 months   come on its got to take its toll  im fine  but thanks anyway  the sushi place next door has a security camera  that covers the parking lot  you know departments chaplains got a good ear  can we stay on the goddamn point the camera caught the license plate  of a greenandwhite pickup it belongs to alvaro  timecode puts him here after the shop closed  so send some units to stake out alvaros house  and you and ill take where he works  its ok ive got simms and giles on it   i got backup  come on  itll be like old times  nina i just got a call from my attorney  we need to talk about this visitation bullshit  can you just try dexters office again  miss hes not picking up  call me when you get this  excuse me are you a friend of dexters  im  his decorator love the hat  terrence give her a visitors badge ill take her up  angel batista im dexters best friend  nice to meet you angel batista  my work requires me to be an expert in analyzing patterns  now a pattern keeps emerging from my past thats all too familiar  harry lying to me  no wonder he destroyed the file on my mothers death  it wasnt to protect me it was to bury his own guilt  look who i found  listen when youre done with him maybe you can come over to my place  its a mess needs a womans touch yeah  what did you say to angel  dexter these are amazing  lila you cant be in here  did you find out what happened to the men responsible  for your mothers murder  dead or in prison except for one  he cut a deal now he lives in naples florida  he runs a tavern  and what are you gonna do about it  not sure yet  and youre not the least bit pissed off that this man got away with murder  you sure  maybe a little  then go and tell him  healing is all about focusing your rage  on the person thats hurt you  naples is what  two hours away we could go tonight   pick me up after work  alright  can i have one of these   sure  what is this stuff  its corn syrup and dye its my own recipe  not bad  thank you  who doesnt fix something like that   you alright  yeah  so im thinking were assuming our killer owns a boat  but what if he  how do you stand this miami heat  makes my toes swell up  so  anyway i was thinking what if the killers renting a boat  i can crossreference some names  you like cucumber sandwiches officer morgan  i dont know anyway  we have some of the dates of when the victims went missing  its all about the cream cheese  so we could crossreference those dates against the rental logs  and maybe the same names will pop up  did you hear anything i just said  not one word  its 100  i always stop and eat lunch at 100  youll learn that about me  why dont you sit down  youre welcome to consider it an order if that helps  the shoes too  shouldnt we be  i dont know investigating the area  youre very fidgety  anyone ever tell you that  yes my father   you applying for the job  just an observation  sorry im confused are you criticizing me for wanting to do my job  yes  its 100  look the last time i was around boats a killer was kidnapping me  which might explain why im living with my brother  and snooping on my new boyfriend  so forgive me for being a little fidgety  but if its lunch were talking im gonna eat a fat pork sandwich  and im sure as shit not gonna eat it here  what  this isnt a commercial marina  i havent seen a single rental id on any of these hulls  but i can see the upkeep on this place is dismal  unsecure perimeter poor lighting  come out here at night no oned know what the hell youre doing  thats why im going to order  on this marina and the two others  as soon as i finish my lunch  i finished my spatter report put in for a personal day  left word with rita  naples here i come  i cant really focus my rage on the man who killed my mother  not with lila along for the ride  but i can prepare for the day when i do  where are you off to so early  getting out of town for the night   dont wait for me  in the middle of the week  thought id take the minivan out on the open road  who are you  youll have the place to yourself   if you want to tie up gabriel again  yeah that one never fucking gets old  call me when youre back i wanna talk to you about coral cove  what about coral cove  the algae on the rocks sent us there  if i were you id really consider moving your boat  security out there sucks ass  thats kind of the point  this little green algae may

this  i didnt tell her  ritas mom found out im in recovery  she wants me to leave rita  and the kids  she could be right  i cant abandon them  so what about what youre gonna say to this guy when you

marco was passed out inside  they blamed the fire on his drugs  but it was me  he died because of me  that night i went to my first meeting  seeing that side of myself was terrifying  that i could

resignation this morning  what about your house  ill put it on the market  sweetie i thought about what you said last night  i havent been here for you and i want to change that  my sisters looking for a new apartment im sure we can help you find one too  well dont be silly ill be living here  dexter be a dear and pass me the cream please  thank you  harry taught me to lie  and keep my darkest secrets from those around me  which is why i need to make sure theres not a trace of blood  left on my boat  he also taught me not to rush to judgment  things arent always what they appear to be  including harry  and what about me  am i the twisted bay harbor butcher  or the valiant dark defender  only time will tell  funny thing is ive met someone who doesnt care what i am  i suppose every hero needs a sidekick  every villain a partner in crime  all my relationships have been built on not knowing  but that may be changing  imagine that  a life with no more secrets
