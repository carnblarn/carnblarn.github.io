suicides are committed by men  women tend to slash their wrists  take pills something more ladylike  not in miami  we closed a couple of suicide cases just like this last year remember  look at this mess  thats a fancy bathtub rich husband  house husband and aspiring artist  promising   so she supported him  it looks like that  she was some kind of bigtime prosecutor  those other suicides we closed   those were highpowered women too right  i dont know i think so  note to self  i dont care what it looks like somebody killed her  were checking out all the possibilities mr gayle  was your

now vanessa gayle   all three powerful women  all  three shot themselves  in the past two years  theyve got to have more in common  than career ambition and a fondness of firearms  why the sudden interest in suicides  morbid curiosity  what can i do for you  so many things  i need the bloodspatter report on vanessa gayle  blood  spatters inconclusive all i can tell is  she was shot at close range i wish i had more for you  me too  maria  the da needs the work sheet  for the icetruckkiller case  im working on it  whend you talk to the da  we had dinner last night  mayor allen took us out to celebrate neil perrys arrest   hell of a good time  hiro de puta  im the one who gets perry to confess and  hes got the mayor kissing his ass  i wouldnt be too upset  matthews will be the one with the egg on his face soon enough  you still believe we got the wrong guy  perrys the pretender to the throne  the real king is still out there and hell kill again  its just a matter of time  or the icetruck killer will use perry  as a getoutofjailfree card  you really think that might happen  if perrys the wrong guy and i let him take the fall  definitely  thanks dexter  what if laguertas right  what if the icetruck killer does disappear  no  hes got unfinished business with me  still i cant just sit on my hands  waiting for something to happen  i need a distraction  nothing like some little debbies  and a worthy new adversary  to clear my head  talk to me ladies  what do you have in common  same sorority  pilates instructor  dr emmett meridian  the three suicide sisters  shared the same therapist   dr emmett meridian  he must be terrible at his job  so far he comes up squeaky clean   no malpractice suit no disgruntled patients  and i thought i was a master at damage control  perhaps i should schedule a session with the good doctor  and try out a little reverse psychology  come on in sean have a seat  thanks for seeing me on such short notice  hey i expect the police to show up when i call right  the least i can do is clear my lunch hour  for a cop in need  so  what brought you here  a friend of mine died  she killed herself  i need to understand why  how come  she had everything going for her it doesnt make sense  to some people death makes perfect sense  life  thats the puzzle  like you sean  what really brought you here  i just told you i came   to talk about your friends suicide i know  i think youre using this suicide deal  as an excuse to come see me  youre absolutely right  how could you tell  im sensing you do it a lot to keep the world at arms length  and what are my real intentions  as soon as i pay for my lunch  youre gonna tell me that  excuse me a second  judging from what ive seen so far i probably will  this guys good  so why do his patients keep dying  vanessas estimated time of death was monday at 700 pm  meridian was in session with scott solomon  i wonder if mr solomon kept his appointment that night  so we got almond chicken  pork fried rice  so sean lets start with the basics you married  no  girlfriend  yes  sex life  its personal  and this is therapy  where we share personal things  you know it might help me open up if you shared  something about yourself why did you become a psychiatrist  see what you just did  trying to take control like that  you probably get away with it most of the time too right  thats a way of preventing other people from getting close to you  let me ask you something sean  have you ever been close to anybody  my  foster father  hes the only one who ever really knew me  youre adopted  harry took me in when i was 3  so tell me about harry  what kind of stuff did you guys do together  you know normal fatherson stuff  all right stop enough  are you all right   im fine im fine  nice ambush  that was the perfect point of attack  i cant believe i finally got you  i won  this isnt a game dexter  no i know  its not supposed to be fun  y eah yeah yeah its just   you think i want to teach you these things  this is the only way i know how to keep you out of an electric chair  this is about survival dex  nothing else  got it  youve got a visitor perry  you miss me  dont flatter yourself  i have to comb through your case before the trial  make sure i have my facts straight  on the notorious icetruck killer  i confessed what more do you need  the evidence to line up  we havent been able to match your prints against the partial  on the lozenge wrapper we found at the abandoned hospital  liquid nitrogen  i use it to freeze the body parts  its extremely effective  but it burns like a bitch  or you knew your prints wouldnt match  so you purposely burned your fingertips to hide it  are you suggesting that im a liar  just covering my bases neil  we both want the same thing  with angelina  to see you convicted  whats in it for me if i help you do your job  how about immortality  we found your mothers body under your house  now you can go down as a pathetic loser  who killed mom  or  the most heinous killer  in floridas history   your choice  if im going to become a legend  i need to be memorialized  i want a reporter here to interview me  front page  youre not allowed to talk to the press before the trial  if you want me to cooperate  im sure youll find a way  meridian had one thing right  i do crave control  the longer the icetruck killer maintains radio silence  the less control i have  craigslist  its desperate i know  but apropos  personal ads are filled with desperation  tyler from key west  speedos tanning on the beach  touched your tits on friday night   at least these folks arent just standing by  waiting for something to happen  and neither am i  dear ken  im in pieces  why the cold shoulder  love barbie  hey i got it  thanks  hey i know you   monday night at meridians  youre always leaving your 700 when im arriving for my 800  you missed last week right  no i was there  i dont remember ever seeing you though   how do you like him  meridian  best thing thats ever happened to me  so far  how about you you finding him helpful  im a sociopath  theres not much he can do for me  cute and funny  let me guess  taken  girlfriend  lucky girl  well thanks for the help but i can handle it from here  all right  so meridian has an alibi for the time of death  my sexual hangups and control issues aside  i need a followup appointment   to dig a little deeper  isnt that what therapys all about  oh my god  i love your body  i love your legs  i love your arms  i couldnt have made them better myself  are you crying  im fine  then what  i dont know   im sure this is really hot crying after sex  everything about you is hot  tell me what youre feeling  its  its just  every time ive ever been naked with someone  we just fuck  but  not this time  this is different  it feels like  i hate saying this it sounds so fucking cheesy  it feels like making love  ew  yes  but ew promise me youll never say that again  what if i do  are you gonna cry about it  youre so fucked up  whats up rock star  look at you  what you doing  wheres the supervisor  oh she called on my cell and canceled  who wants to play monster tag   i do  you  im coming after you  you better run  paul  you know youre not allowed unsupervised visits  i know big bad paul needs a babysitter  its your day off right  now would it really be so terrible  if we spent time with our kids together  i have a lunch date with dexter  come on itll be fun  mom dad come on  i guess i could call dexter  its official   im nominating you for mom of the year  here comes the monster  here comes the monster  contrary to what dr meridian thinks  i dont always keep others at a distance  things are looking up already  hey barbie how would you like to suck my cock  or not  clearly nobody here is my missing partner in crime  hey whats up you were looking for me  what did forensics come back with on vanessa gayle  gunpowder on her hand none on her husbands  highangle trajectory  no drugs in the tox screen  it all points to suicide   no chance it was murder  too bad huh  i had the husband pegged too  was hoping he could help me score my own sugar mama   try craigslist  i already did   nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits  miami metro can close this case as a suicide  but im still not convinced  maybe my new therapist can shed some light on my doubts  you seem on edge today  im not getting what i came here for  whatd you come here for  we established in our last visit that  it wasnt to talk about suicide   or feelings  heaven forbid  so what do you want to talk about  fakes   people who pass themselves off as something theyre not  like a preownedcar salesman  a brave politician  a jew for jesus  a wolf in sheeps clothing  is that how you feel sean  like youre hiding a dark secret  no i wasnt talking about me  who youre talking about  you  thats a common firsttime reaction to therapy  you think i cant care about you  that im only pretending to care because i have another motive  bingo  you got me  i do have another motive  its called a paycheck  but that doesnt mean that i cant care for my patients  or enjoy my job  how are things at your job  frustrating to tell you the truth  what kind of forensics do you do  blood spatter  most people cant stand blood  i hate it  categorizing and analyzing must be very soothing for you  yeah it is actually  so okay how are things with your girlfriend  she canceled lunch with me to be with her exhusband  sounds like a lot things are out of your control right now  no wonder you cut yourself off from your emotions  that way you never have to feel powerless  so then what should i do  accept that certain things are out of your hands  let go  hey morgan   i cant believe out of two million sperm  you were the fastest swimmer  what are you gonna do about it  i wanted to kill him dad  it must have been tough for you to walk away son  im proud that you did that  dont be  because i still want to kill him  whens that gonna go away  i think i have everything i need mr perry  whens the story gonna run  well theyre saving space for tomorrow front page  i just got to get back and write  thanks so much for your time   how was your interview  it was fine  you ready to talk about the case  sure  as soon as i get to talk to a reporter   you just did  oh give me a break  that poser was one of your cop buddies  but nice try  in case you forgot neil  youre the one in jail i call the shots  wrong i could invoke my miranda rights at any time   and lawyer up  its that too wrong  beacause if you wanted a lawyer youd have one by now  i know your game lieutenant  you think im a fraud and youre trying to prove it  but the truth is  youre the fraud  you know what neil  im really not in the mood for your shit today  i found out how you got promoted  back when you and sergeant doakes were still partners  doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer   brought you along for the ride  how did you get  when the perp bailed from a thirdstory apartment  doakes took the fire escape  sent you to cover the stairs  just in case  only  you got lucky  and you made the headline grab  and so the legend began  i wonder if doakes would have made a good lieutenant   i deserved that promotion  im sure you did  it was a big bust  not as big as catching me of course but uh  lets be honest  you didnt catch me  your captain did  at least thats what theyre saying on the news  my therapist wants me to accept the things that are out of my hands  tragically for him hes not out of my hands  not if i can find proof that the death of at least  three women under his care was not a coincidence  breaking and entering  i hope he got my good side  now whats he recording for posteritys sake  goodbye dexter  hello ladies  i need another prescription  im sorry vanessa i cant do that  just one more please  we talked about this  the antidepressants were a temporary crutch  so that you could start taking steps on your own  but you dont understand i cant do this on my own  i cant even get out of fucking bed  i just  i want to die  look at me  i understand the appeal of death okay  no more pain  all the career pressure the hopelessness gone  in many cultures  theres no stigma attached to taking ones life  suicides respected  even revered as a matter of personal conscience  how do most people do it  well painkillers are the most common  but theyre entirely unreliable  the truly courageous of heart  use guns  you took women who trusted  you  at their weakest possible moment  and rather than help them you suggested they end it all  god you even gave them permission to use a gun  youre a mean one mr shrink  create their drug addiction pull them off  then fill their addled heads with noble thoughts of suicide  i think ive had a breakthrough in therapy  hey i got your texts is everything   okay  it is now  okay just i wanted to see you  i felt bad about missing lunch  to be with paul and the kids  i hope you didnt get the wrong idea  no of course not  howd it go  really good  and incredibly scary  for the first time in a long while i  saw how easy it would be for me to fall back into my old life   why is that scary  because  i like my new life  and i finally feel like im in control  i never felt that way with paul  i do with you  this is a disaster  i chose rita because she was damaged  if she gets better ill lose her for sure  im ready dexter  i dont know what ive been so afraid of  youre the perfect boyfriend  i want you to spend the night for real  im so sorry  i came over here because i thought something was wrong  but tonights really not a good night  im right in the middle of a case im way too distracted  now its so late  thats all the more reason to get back to work  the clocks ticking here  but ill call you tomorrow okay  okay  shit  i cant have sex with rita  every time i sleep with a woman  she sees me for what i really am   empty   and then shes gone  but i dont want rita to go  which means i have to deal with this  i cant kill meridian yet i need another therapy session  stay where you are im armed  with bad puns  you said you needed a favor whats up  take off your pants  oh i should have known it was that kind of favor  you never ask me to come by before work  no but i like the way you think  i have a patient  who lost both her legs in a car accident   really brutal  like your mom  which is why i want to do something special for her  i want to give her a new smokin pair of legs    yours  no   let me just take a cast  no way no  itll take 20 minutes tops   i dont   come on please  stop being such a chick sit down  feels good  can i make one of your cock  thatd be a hell of a story to tell the bullpen huh  not likely  i havent told anyone about us  embarrassed about banging captain hook  not even a little  then why  i guess this matters to me  so if i talk about it and it goes away  im actually losing something  that retarded  no  but i got to tell you  im not going anywhere  seriously  and neither are you  cause i got your leg  where the hell you been  with my boyfriend   boyfriend  yep  we just fucked in his office  and were having dinner tomorrow night   you looking for me  yeah  shut the door  did you tell anyone about our bust  the one that got me promoted  no  nobody in the press  maria we talked about this when it happened  it would fuck up your rep and make me look like a whiny bitch  its bad for both of us  so then the only way to access that information  would be to read to police report right  i guess  we have to have our firewall checked  she was sitting on top of me basically naked  asking me to spend the night  and i didnt know what to do  its okay sean  dont beat yourself up  your girlfriend really means something to you i know that  if she means something why do i run away from her  to the same reason you work so hard to shut everybody else out  cause youre afraid they wont like what they see  yeah i think youre right  how can i change that  well for starters you accept the fact  that we all have a big bad wolf hiding inside of us  a darkness we dont want anyone else to see   do you  of course i do  really  and how do you deal with your wolf  well first of all i accepted that it was there  i made friends with it  and now i just let it out for a big meal  once in a while  at least three times that we know about  can we get back to the sex thing  this is all about sex  the reason you avoid sexual intimacy  is because you dont want to surrender control  no ive surrendered control its not like my  girlfriend hasnt been you know  south of the border  thats not what im talking about  intimacy   really letting go facetoface   theres nothing more difficult than that  the minute you start to accept who you are  you just might feel free enough to share that intimacy together  what are you doing  id like to talk you through a deeprelaxation technique  it might bring some things to the surface  what kinds of things  there must have been a time in your life  when you felt powerless right  foster child  no control over your destiny  if we can bring some of those memories to the surface  we might find the root of your control issues  first i want you to close your eyes  and focus on your breathing  i want you to count each breath okay  in 1  and out 2 just give it a try  this is ridiculous i could be killing him right now  now i want you to think of a time  when you felt completely  and totally powerless  hey morgan you still fucking your sister  leave me alone josh  i told you to walk away  god damn it dexter  there are consequences to everything you do in life  lose control become powerless and its over   i found the grave son  ill be like this forever  mommy  i have to get out of here  sean come here  sean sean sean  oh my god  are you okay  stay  stay with me  youre sweet  i am  next time well figure out what to tell the kids  so you dont have to sneak out like this  you want there to be a next time  and a time after that  dont you  no i mean yeah  i just  i didnt freak you out  why would you think that  dexter theres nothing you could ever do  that would scare me away  i really hope you came to apologize  nope i came for a consult  and you brought beverages  i got this on loan from the morgue  now i could use an expert opinion  specifically your expert opinion  see we cant figure out  exactly how the killer cut off this head  can you  nope  really  i think you can  i mean you chop people up dont you  maybe you need a closer look  no keep it away  i talked to the medical examiner  he couldnt confirm how your mom died  said it might have been a heart attack   i killed her  you dont have the balls  i mean you had to wait till she died to chop her up  and even then you were too squeamish to cut off her head  not exactly the same as stuffing roadkill is it  oh fuck you  serial killers get all the glory dont they neil  especially the icetruck killer you know  youre not the first groupie to take credit   for someone elses work  oh bullshit  i know details about the case  things that werent published in the newspapers  thats because you hacked into our computer system  thats why i had the it guys check our firewall  the dmz was breached you read all our police reports  you even got yourself a nice paneled car last month   nice touch by the way  why are you doing this  because youre not a killer  youre a coward and a fake arent you   maybe you need another look  no take it away  all right i lied okay  just i need you to take it away from me  please  so whats on your mind lieutenant  we got a lot to get done before perrys trial  yeah about that trial   ive got some bad news  perry recanted his confession this morning  what are you talking about  i was going over some details with him at county  and he admitted that he gave us a false confession  hes a wannabe tom  just wanted his 15 minutes thats all  how do you know which time he was lying  all due respect maria if we dropped charges  every time someone recanted his confession  our jails would be empty  were going to trial  all due respect captain thats really not up to you  its up to the da  i understand your frustration maria  but i reviewed the da work sheets  the evidence is compelling  well move forward with the trial as planned  fair enough  if thats what you two want im fully behind it  i was really worried about you you sure youre all right  i kept calling your house  but i think the number you gave me didnt work  you wouldnt have reached me anyway  cause i was at my girlfriends  i spent the night  facetoface  sean  thats very good  its all good doctor  i even stopped worrying about that friend of mine whos been out of touch  you cant control other people you know  this is a real breakthrough you should be proud of yourself  i am proud  truth be told i never expected to  make progress in therapy  thats not true  if that were true  you never would have come in here in the first place  what do you want to focus on today  glad you asked that  im gonna tell you something  that ive never told anyone before  okay  im a serial killer  oh god  oh that feels so   so amazing to say out loud  well you must be letting go  because ive never heard you make a joke before  im not joking i kill people  there it is again  you should try it  i know  your big bad wolf  has racked up a tidy little death toll  im just kidding  i disabled the cameras and i copied the files  i dont know what youre talking about  then focus on your breathing  maybe youll remember   meghan carolyn vanessa  those sessions are confidential  im a control freak i know  but i watched your home movies its amazing stuff   drugs guns and a crazy psychiatrist  no wonder youre so well versed in control issues  you got quite the god complex  this sessions over  not so fast doc  youre awake  shall we analyze your dreams  no thats right  youve already told me everything i need to know  except  why powerful women  you took powerful women  and made them powerless  they left behind families children  i have to confess im a little conflicted  youve helped me make a major selfdiscovery  the fact that im a killer  thats something i cant control  you helped me to accept what i really am  im grateful for that  but  i was raised with a certain set of principles  im sorry doc  actions have consequences  and this is yours  im gonna have to let you go   my darling    turn the radio up for that sweet sound    hold me close never let me go    keep this feelin alive make me lose control    hello  is that eric carmen  no whats up  im running late im in the middle of some housework  if i dont get it done before we see its gonna drive me crazy  i never knew you were so anal  and im a neat freak  youre just full of surprises huh  oh you have no idea  ill be there as soon as i can okay  okay  barbie be patient  one day well share a cold one
