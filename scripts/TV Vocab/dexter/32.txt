                previously on dexter  we need to go after the root cause  this bloodsucking soulless defense attorney ellen wolf  has she uh ever actually killed anyone  keep an open mind about her  miguels on his way over here right now  i know one side of him maybe theres more  missing evidence witness intimidation jury tampering   you got proof  hes a bad guy hes not a stupid guy  im pregnant  they say this part should pass soon  this isnt some kind of weird end run is it  make me see how sensitive you really are   im not all that sensitive  yeah you are  someone loaned freebo some money and is willing to skin people to get it back  which is why i want to use our ci more aggressively  wait you mean anton  yeah were gonna spread the word that anton knows where freebo is  youre gonna use him as bait  which means that the skinner will be looking for me  am i being set up  i found the fucking lead on the skinner case ok  the skinner is using treetrimming as a cover for surveillance  he watches from the trees and when the time is right he grabs them  i know what you did for me  i will be your bait  so you told quinn i was investigating him  hey youre the one who fucked him not my fault he didnt want an encore  a cops dead cause quinn cut all the wrong corners  next dead cops on you  what did it feel like to end his life  felt like justice  were likeminded together we can make a difference  its said that everything is connected to everything  the butterfly effect  you drop a pebble into a pond and the ripples radiate outwards  touching and affecting everything  until finally a fish grows arms and legs and crawls out of the water  and picks up a rock and smashes the next two fish over the head  and we have the first serial killer  mm  this is good pizza   what channels espn over here  uh  i think its a big number  yeah there you go  and now we got gary going the other way trying to get in  oh  no way thats not a foul man  that was definitely wrong what that guy did  youre clearly not a sports fan are you  not really  im more of a national geographic kinda guy  sharks bears the occasional penguin   you do have other interests though  yeah i suppose i do  speaking of which  uhuh boundaries  yeah its encrypted  oh yeah thats right trust issues  mmhm   football  see you do know your sports  this guy right here billy fleeter   should i know him  not yet but hopefully you will  this was from maybe five years ago  he never went pro drug problem turned to gambling  unfortunately he wasnt very good at it  more than once hes paid his debts off to his bookies by working as an enforcer  breaking fingers  crushing skulls with a baseball bat  i went after him a few years ago but uh i just couldnt get the evidence  i had to tell the children of a 70yearold man that he had just killed  that there was nothing we could do  so here it comes miguel wants me to kill him  i dont want you to kill him  no  i wanna do it  you  ive let you do all of the heavy lifting so far now its my turn  im ready to get my hands dirty  its one thing to let miguel provide a little backup  another thing to share the reins with him  im gonna need your help dexter  not a good idea  just uh think about it  no dexter dont think about it  the waffle is a lot like the pancake only square  why is it square  because it was invented by simon p waffle  and he liked to stack his waffles in boxes  and thats just easier to do if theyre square  youre making that up  im hurt that you would even think that  oh god dexter youre making a mess   thats ok well clean it up  its not the point   what is the point  i dont know  the point is not to make a mess to begin with  ritas pregnancy hormones seem to be ganging up on us this morning  how come there are no english muffins left  uh i think you ate the last one yesterday waffle  thats disgusting  cody you need a haircut  lets see four five six more months till she delivers   rita are you ok  no im not ok  im starting a new job and im planning a wedding all by myself  what can i do to help  its not like you can pick out the dj  last time i got into your car your radio was tuned to marching music  it helps me think  and its not like you can pick the florist or the caterer or even the wedding bands  i could pick the wedding bands  right like the engagement ring you never gave me   you said you didnt want one  i dont want one  who drank all the orange juice   jesus christ  what   you have like no hot water in your shower  right   i told you to wait remember  i cant wait  some of us have jobs to get to  im a musician i work nights  yeah and what do you do with the rest of your day  you take a nap you watch cartoons  jack off   oh i rarely watch cartoons  fucking hilarious  mm  well you better not be writing any more songs about me  most ladies would be flattered  well most ladies arent cops  oh right right  i gotta go  yeah ok  come get these  yeah  freebos dead  and now theres a treetrimmers convention in here  it seems random but its not  the butterfly effect again  of course its an odd sensation when you happen to be the butterfly  and if i were to help miguel kill billy fleeter  who knows the effect that would have on the world  is this the beginning of a whole new level of friendship  is it the end of life as i know it  mr king we met at the scene of our second victim is that correct  yes that is correct  have you ever worked at any of these addresses  no no see these are city jobs  im a private contractor  ok well im gonna need a list of all of your employees  i can get you a copy of my payroll records  that would be a big help   how soon do you need this  ten minutes ago would be great   very well  thank you  looks like someone got lucky last night  uh lets just say that barbara and i have taken it to the next level  you know that now youve done the deed shes gonna be taking notes  making a checklist of your every move to see if youre relationship material  thats not true wait is it  well its not like we write anything down  its more of a mental process  morning loo  third day in a row of this huh  lets hope something shakes loose on this come here   uh i have a favor to ask you ok  shoot  i gotta go to that peace officers association thing tomorrow night  you wanna you wanna be my date  maria um thank you for the invite  but i have plans and if i bail i dont think its gonna go over too well  like that huh   ok good for you  ok  relationships are complicated  letting miguel kill fleeter would be a gamble  this guys a gambler look where it got him  something to consider when miguel and i do our research tonight at the casino  howd you find out about this place  research  always a first good step right  move a little closer  tonight is just about watching learning his routine  where does he go and when what does he do when he gets there   ok  later well meet him  we  yeah well see how it goes  right now we dont want him to notice us we dont want anyone to notice us  cameras all over the place  number one rule of the code is dont get caught  code what code  how much do i tell him  its just a series of precautions  learned where   common sense mostly  a little more than that   well my dad was a cop  right so he taught you  what cops look for in an investigation  oh and so you work it backwards from there right  plus i spend all day looking at other peoples mistakes you pick things up  im sure  am i forgetting something dexter  was there one final lesson  where i said go now far and wide and preach the code my son  i dont think so  so when you popped anton for drug possession was it just pot was it coke   what was it  uh pot i think  right it couldnt have been anything too serious or you wouldnt have made him a ci  i guess   youre just full of answers today  no its  i just busted guys like him every day i dont remember   and its all written down somewhere  right ci files  hello  hey lazy hope im waking you up  hey lazy i havent been to bed yet  look i need your ci number im gonna file a status report  whats a ci number  your assigned confidential informant number  it should be on your paychecks  what checks  hello your paychecks from the county  hello i dont get any paychecks quinn always pays me in cash  oh ok ill get it from him then  my client was supposed to be sent to county yesterday  apparently he was but then they put him on the next bus back here in the afternoon   ive been chasing him all over the place  we shouldnt have those mixups  is it a mixup or is miguel fucking with me  ever since i started looking into him  hes been going out of his way to make my job harder  well you knew that was gonna happen  doesnt mean i cant bitch about it  oh anyway i should go see my client  and ask what perfectly logical reason he had for lighting his exwifes house on fire  oh i wanted to ask you  any chance youd go to a police charity function with me tomorrow night  hmm  room full of cops i cant imagine anything more fun  shouldnt have asked  im kidding id love to go  ok next on your list mr king santiago ramirez  he no longer works for me that didnt end so well   why  he was run over  uh mario astorga didnt i talk to him  yes if you remember hes the one who found the body of that man  right second victim   marios one of my best foremen  so hes a good guy  what hes not a good guy  he has a temper he gets very angry  keep going  i knew his family back in nicaragua  were both from san marcos   but mario had to leave  why  the police were looking for him  i heard he killed someone with a knife  do you know where i can find mario  i dont know where he lives but tomorrow hell be at bayside park   you sure  i make the schedule  fleeter pays off his gambling debts by eliminating people for his bookie  a schoolteacher here a mother of two there  people who cant settle their debts  sending a message to others pay up   do i help miguel move forward on this or do i listen to harry and shut it down  hey you  yeah i just heard a love song on the radio that reminded me of you  oh thats sweet   and it made me really angry  oh  so have you gotten the wedding bands yet  um im still doing my research but im on it  i gotta go  hey you know anything about wedding rings  yeah wedding rings and nuclear fission are like my secret specialties  thanks  your brothers kind of a dweeb huh  you say anything more about my brother  and i will kick your fucking nuts down your throat  that doesnt even make any sense  so hey anton doesnt have any priors  you pay him in cash and i cant find him in the ci database  should be in there  what are you hiding  anton is not officially a ci   what do you mean  come here for a second  look it was just easier for both of us  i never filed an arrest report on him so he has no police record  i did him a favor plus it saved me the hassle of all that paperwork  you have got to be fucking kidding me  we used him as bait  he was putting his life at risk and he was under no legal obligation to help us  no there was just no paperwork thats all  not to mention that because hes not officially a ci  theres no end date to when hes done working for us  so you can just string him along as long as you want to  what are you getting so upset about what are you in love with the guy  no im not in love with him  but youre sleeping with him  jesus christ do you know what kind of a bonehead mistake that is  sleeping with an informant thatll screw up your career   hes not an informant you just said it  but you didnt know   either way it makes you look stupid  you dont get to lecture me asshole  anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit against the police department  once he finds out how you fucked him over  if someone told him  of course im gonna tell him  youll sell out a cop for some dope youre fucking  thats not half as bad as being responsible for another cop dying  because you dont like to play by the rules  what  yuki told me  you dont know what the fuck youre talking about  despite harrys warnings  here i am with miguel outside billy fleeters house  if im gonna stop this its gonna have to be soon  are you sure you want to do this its breaking and entering   but you know that  yes i do lets go  here put these on  forensics guy who always has latex gloves on him  no one would ever think twice huh  i guess youre right  i dont want miguel to see how easy this is for me  uh you want me to try  no i think i  i got it  so what are we looking for  proof that hes guilty  we know he bludgeons people to death so look for something bludgeony  uh this looks like its been knocked around some  hold it up  purple  ergo  blood  how easy is this  ill test it against the blood of his alleged victims let you know later today  you know it takes me two days to get a search warrant  then another day to catalogue evidence  and then a week before i can get the lab results  this is definitely the way to go  we also need to make sure that hes likely to kill again   why is that  its just one of the rules  one of these days im gonna make you sit down and write out all these rules for me  hehe kills whenever he needs money  thats how he pays off his debts to the bookie  dex ive tried a lot of these gamblers before and they all keep records  theyre like anal about their numbers theres got to be like a ledger somewhere  maybe theres a hidden wall safe or something  were talking about the man who leaves his murder weapon in an umbrella stand  youre right what if we dont find anything  then we dont move forward  leave it dex just put it back  you can stop this right now call it off  why should i call it off  i didnt teach you the code to share with your buddies  i taught you the code to keep you alive  you dont get to have friends dexter  nothing good can come out of this  hey dex you know what  i dont think were gonna find anything here man  look at you  its my life dad   i think we know how hes gonna pay that off  so look we moving forward  yeah moving forward  if the blood matches  i cant believe we are just now sending out invitations  this is so lastminute  its ok theres plenty of time  and dexters no help  i asked him for menu suggestions  do you know what he says  i dont know  steak he says steak  yeah thats great dexter thats really great  well start with a steak appetizer  followed by steak salad followed of course by a steak  and then of course itll all be topped off by a steak fucking cake  rita   rita  what  the envelope youre making a mess  oh  shit  why dont you stuff for a while ill do the addresses  ok  ive got big news  yeah about the skinner  no about you  youre free  oh yeah ever since abe lincoln  i mean from the police department  youre no longer a ci  wait a second the way quinn explained it was that if i play ball  it would knock down my felony possession to a misdemeanor  and if i worked hard enough it would go away altogether  well its gone away  hmm hows that  clerical error  the necessary papers were never filed  so there were never any charges for you to work off  so ive been doing all this shit when i didnt have to  just be glad you dont have to do it anymore  hmm  well thank you  and i want to put protective detail on you  what no no debra   anton  listen you said im free  so im free of this   so we should celebrate  dinner tonight  mm no im working tonight  how about we celebrate now  ive got to go back to work  tomorrow breakfast  perfect  so im guessing we got a blood match huh  thats why were here  life vests  we cant exactly load up the cart with axes and machetes can we  exactly right  so um have you given any thought as to how you want to do this  mmhm smallcaliber gun to the head  coge  then i walk away   that happens all the time  guns make noise  and they leave evidence behind  bullets casings powder residue   not to mention the body  ok  you dont want to create a crime scene  its where experts like me gather evidence against you  ok ok i get it i get it  what do you suggest  up close and personal  hey in case we have to tie anybody up  im gonna put together a starter kit for you  hey youre gettin better  yeah what do you know  what better place to gamble on miguel than a room full of games of chance  where slot machines go to die huh  and at least one gambler  i think thats it   now we pick up mr fleeter  you ever drop a quart of milk  watch it spread over the whole kitchen floor the mess it makes  yeah  theres six quarts of blood in the human body this isnt gonna be pretty  theres no shame in backing out  dex after 14 years of filing briefs  trying cases and dealing with bullshit  this is all gonna look nice and neat in comparison  i have been to some lameass rubber chicken dinners in my day ok   i know i know  a nohost bar is punishment enough  but no bar at all is cruel  and unusual   all right im buying the first round  thank you  thats pretty  gift from my first husband  nice nice  youre handsome  dire ethanol emergency here  whatll it be ladies  uh cuba libre for this one  gracias  and a double scotch neat soda back pourmoi  very nice  mm huh  easy  and who was that guy that suit and haircut sitting next to you that wouldnt shut up  oh the um the senior liaison for the greater mi who knows  whats sad is that this is the only social event ive been to in six months  oh that doesnt qualify as a social event  ok  can i get you anything else  yeah how about a foot massage with those big gorgeous hands of yours  theyre kind of cold from scooping ice  mm  hmm but youre hot  cheers   nothing shy about you huh  no  well  after a pair of empty marriages i realized  the secret to long life and happiness is  well chocolate and flirting with young hopefully hung men  sounds fattening and dangerous   oh but so fun  hmm   which clearly youre not having enough of  i am  look believe me ive had my fun  you need to be raising hell and breaking hearts   i need to be  you need to be  the skirtwearing days do not last forever  we all end up old and in the way  i tell miguel to be inconspicuous and what does he do  he shows up looking like the unabomber  ive got my work cut out for me  oh close game close game  yeah good d  good game huh  no its not a good game  good game is when they dont beat the fucking point spread  oh you got a little money riding on this  a little bit  shit   sorry  yeah  not half as sorry as somebody else is gonna be  here we go  buenas noches patrn  hey who was that guy  uh i dont know some guy   how do you know him  i dont  dex sometimes people recognize me  its off were not doing this   we need to take down the kill room  no no dex lets just wait  no one ever goes in that room there you saw tranquilo huh  we decide tomorrow ok  well see  anton me again  waiting on you still  the way i figured it you gigged until closing  then you went home and smoked some of that herb that you keep in your cereal box  and now like all selfindulgent vaguely adolescent musicians  you are sleeping in till noon and im ok with that  ok im ok with that  as long as youre alone  ok ok too much caffeine  a dutch farmer sees his crop fail  no money to his name he takes a job working on a boat  an unseasonably strong wind blows him to indonesia  he drops a bean into the soil  and voil 400 years later  java  everything is connected  hello  dex wanna hook up for breakfast im buying  i would deb but im already freshly bageled   what are you doing up so early  trying to be a good fianc  rita made me vice president in charge of wedding rings  so im off to the jewellery store  and what do you know about buying women jewelry   zero  less than jesus dex  look ill meet you at that place on 2nd street at ten oclock ok  the wedding band has to match the engagement ring what does that look like  she said she didnt want one  my god you just get dumber every day  how do you survive in this world of course she wants one  how am i supposed to know that  youre such a ychromosome clich  just buy her a beautiful romantic i love you with all of my heart  fucking engagement ring  and dex size matters  can i ask you something nonjewelrywise  go for it  ok hypothetically  lets say that this guy has to work with this girl but he fucking hates doing it  and too bad cause he has no fucking choice  and  and one thing leads to another  and this hypothetical guy  starts having sex with this hypothetical girl  hypothetical sex  real sex  really real sex  but then the guy is told he no longer has to work with this girl  and poof he just disappears you know thin air adis  so im wondering  is it possible mr hypothetical never really was all that into this girl  and he was just getting it on to i dont know pass the time  or satisfy primal urges or whatever  sounds perfectly reasonable to me  what the fuck do you know  that one i gotta go sit in a hot car and wait for a suspect  hey anton  what the fuck call me  i can bring mario in myself  let you get all the credit for catching the skinner no fucking way   we dont know hes the skinner  closest thing we got  that was really fucking unfair what you said yesterday  well is it true  that a cop died because of you   its not that simple  try me  yuki amado was my partner in narcotics  there was another detective on our team stewart  he made a bad judgment call and shot an unarmed coke dealer  i remember that  paralyzed him right  then stewart went on a bender until he finally swallowed his own bullet  how does yuki make that your fault  because stewart had a problem with crystal meth  and i knew it  and rather than bust him i tried to protect him  so it is your fault  listen to you everything is so black and white   you could have stopped him  sure if i knew what i knew now   but thats not the way things work  im sorry youre just making excuses  of course im making excuses  dont you how else do you sleep at night  who the fuck said i sleep at night  then you must be killing yourself over hooking up with anton huh  yeah it was probably a mistake i think he lost interest once he realized he was free  not so black and white is it  mario  mario astorga   fuck  fuck  im guessing he didnt want to come in for questioning   he made a run for it  interview two   whats his story  so far he hasnt said a word  ah you keep at it and you check with nicaraguan authorities on priors   were just waiting to hear back  qu jodienda  im never gonna get out of here  i gotta call barbara and cancel our dinner  oh shes not gonna like that  i mean itits work  im not here leave a message  hello barbara  this is uh sergeant angel batista  angel to you  how are you  good i hope  so i have to cancel our dinner tonight  and i am deeply deeply apologetic  and i hope that you will let me make it up to you  in whatever possible way  you wish things made up to you in  oh i can tell by that look on your face  youre trying to figure out how to tell me something i dont wanna hear  calling off the kill   its over  really dex  just because some guy recognized me in a bar  no one is ever gonna make that connection once fleeter disappears  im not taking that chance  thats not the way you do things right  no it isnt   tell me about that  what are you asking  i wasnt gonna bring it up before but im guessing  youve been doing this for a while  freebo wasnt your first  was he  how many dex  ok you know what it doesnt matter  i will respect your privacy  but i just dont understand why are you not gonna help me here  just because we broke this little rule from your code  come on dex its ok  no its not ok  you never should have asked me to help you youre not ready  im not or is it you thats not ready  huh because we could have dealt with this fleeter problem like three times already  and you keep throwing up these roadblocks with all this code bullshit   its not bullshit  keep telling yourself that dex  its like wearing a fucking straitjacket man  no miguel its just the opposite  if i didnt have the code the darkness  i could stand here and tell you another story about my abusive father  but what i havent told you about is that time that i kicked the shit out of him  and knocked him down a flight of stairs and i really enjoyed it  that was the first time in my life that ive ever felt  powerful like  like i was in control ofof something  and ever since then ive been trying to get that feeling back again  so when you talk to me about the darkness inside of you  i understand  i really do  i just want to let some of mine out too  i know you understand that  you know what mr astorga maybe i should have opened with my closer  meaning  we know about the incident in managua the one where you stabbed a cab driver  he touched my sister sadly he survived  thats a heartbreaking story   still you are an illegal guest of our country  immigrations on the way  youre gonna be on a plane before the sun comes up  but i have a son  he was born here hes a us citizen hes my life   your boys a us citizen  yes  then he stays maybe your wife too we dont know yet  we do know if you keep stonewalling us on this skinner case  you are gone on a oneway ticket  no matter what you try to do to me the facts aint changing  i dont know anything about anything  then why would george king suggest otherwise  seor king said i knew something  in a word yup  and seor king will be very disappointed to hear youre calling him a liar  no  please  what are you so afraid of mario   yeah whatd this guy do to you  what can he do to you  please  send me back to nicaragua   alone  si yes  alone  we mentioned george kings name once and he turns to jello  scared to death of him   you thinking what im thinking  yeah king jobbed us  im gonna issue a bolo for him  hello  shit  who was it  uh me  i was checking to see if my phone was working  barbara never called me back  i think i ruined it  sorry  dating sucks  yeah  well im outta here still no george king but we put the word out  barbara  mm  you got my message  yup been listening to it all day  makes me laugh every time   its pretty bad huh  um the worst   im glad i amuse you  not half as glad as i am  hey did they finish already  they never even started  what do you mean wheres anton  he never showed   why  i dont know  they waited an hour they called doesnt answer  thanks  oye chiquitico  what the f  poetic  are you ready  i am  thank you  thank you for this  for letting me in  for showing me the way  look at him  look at him trying to figure it all out  what the fuck  were here because of them  those lives that you destroyed  who are you  were justice  hey man i was just doing what i had to do  as are we  ive always done the deed alone  never stood outside  been a witness to this moment  the moment of truth  can miguel go through with it  can he step out of the cocoon and fly  how do you feel  fantastic  shouldnt we get him out of here  as bonded as we may feel  there are still things i cant share with miguel  i got it  no its its too much work  leaving no trace is my area of expertise  yeah but dex  get home before sylvia starts to wonder where you are  i mean it  ok  im going  not a good idea  that would be against your code huh  sorry  anton you in there  hello anton  oh god  shit trimmed trees the skinners been here  you were wrong it went well  maybe who knows  you cant admit it he did good  that was never the issue dex  i was only thinking about you  of course  youve set something in motion here  everything miguel does from now on is connected to you  its a lot of responsibility teaching him what you just did  a heavy burden  it was too much for me to bear i hope youre a stronger man  hey  youre still up  i cant sleep  i hope its ok  my god  its its perfect  oh  dexter god youve been such a saint through all this  i dont know how youve put up with me  if you need me to help out with more of the wedding stuff  no no its  its the hormones  i go crazy when im pregnant  tell me about it  thats not true  you should just get out while you can just run for your life  i wont  i promise  its like i have this monster living inside of me  and i dont know how to control it  maybe i can help you out with that one  its so beautiful  its been said that a butterfly can flap its wings in brazil  and set off a storm in florida  im taking the chance thats not entirely true
