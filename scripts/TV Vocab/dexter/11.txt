 no rest for the wicked  hows gene  good days and bad  he just finished his first round of radiation  well hes a good guy  not much of a bridge player though  harry and gene used to get  so mad every time doris and i would take them to the cleaners  i was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me  well sure thing  got a date  not exactly  its the crime scene where harry found me  i wish i could help but  everything from that long ago is boxed up  in the basement at city hall  and as you can see  im up to my youknowwhat in yearend reports so  its my lieutenant  camilla is there anything you remember  what i remember dexter morgan is your father caring enough  to bring you into his home and give you a loving family  i wouldnt keep your lieutenant waiting  who found the body parts  i did  they were left under the tree  i thought it was the crew from last night just messing around  till i found the head  i told him not to touch anything but he never listens  god patty youre such a bitch  did you guys see anything out of the ordinary  before you found the body  there were some broken ornaments by the tree  who could do something like this so close to christmas  the grinch  oh youre a fucking riot max  like anyones gonna go shopping down here after this   there go our jobs  thank you for your cooperation  oh sucks to be an elf  get some visual surveillance  i  got here as fast as i could what are we looking at  female victim cut up into pieces  the icetruck killer so soon  yep and after the bloodbath at the hotel  cant wait to see how the captains gonna  handle the press on this one   james  yeah  i need you to walk dexter to the crime scene  and will somebody turn off  this goddamn snow machine  your sister can help you out  that a whole sexualtension thing or am i missing something   its the same numbers he left at marina view hotel  any leads as to what they mean  weve talked to numerologists  mathematicians  code breakers  nothing  they  need more to go on  first he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood  now he leaves me this   a calming oasis in the desert of my confusion  it doesnt make sense  crime scenes wiped clean  another hooker  ho ho ho  another dead ho  somebodys been naughty  hey morgan  want to sit on my lap when were done  and tell me what you want for christmas  and hes back  no thanks  last thing on my wish list  is a burning sensation when i pee  this doesnt seem right  body parts scattered among the presents  broken ornaments  its not his usual meticulous style  it seems rushed  haphazard  that would explain why we cant find one of the hands  whats wrong  theres something underneath the torso  merry christmas miami  after all this time  why do you think the icetruck killer has struck again  any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part  do you think it has any connection with your departments  handling of the neil perry fiasco  sir  youve arrested the wrong man  made the world think im a rank amateur  and im very very angry  to answer for your mistakes  stop the tape  what are you doing  look at her tears theyre rolling up  oh my god  bastards got her upside down  thats how

to say goodbye  but there wasnt any time  he loves you guys so much  i forgot my math book  im  im sure hed love to hear from you  we could write him a letter  its all your fault  you could at least pretend you want to be here  youre the one who had the urgent need for tacos  yeah so we could talk about rudy  hes been acting weird lately  last night he said we need to talk  well thats never good  well thanks i feel a lot better  ive only been obsessing about this all day  think you could talk to him for me  look its rudy  i sort of called him  dex deb didnt tell me youd be joining us

had a little workshop accident this morning  doesnt look like it happened this morning  the cuts already closing up  did  i say i meant yesterday morning  i think im working too hard  anyway i dont think my lip is why  deb arranged this little chitchat  my sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise  your sisters wrong  so this whole need to talk thing  im starting to look at the big picture  shes someone that  i could see spending the rest of my life with you know  no i dont know  but i do know that debs falling for you  hard  you hurt her   and youll hurt me  something like that  angel se recupera  angel va a estar en la casa para la navidad  okay el es un hombre fuerte y strong  y adems  im tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck  hey you  you had us so worried  if id have known that  this would get you back in the same room with me  i would have gotten stabbed sooner  im gonna get the doctor  no no no what are you doing  no dejalo  the doctor said youre lucky to be alive  and still have a liver  thats why i got two right  its a good thing you decided to be a cop  tell me that you caught the cocksucker  that ruined one of my best shirts  we dont have any leads  did you see anything  no  he was behind me  i just felt the blade go in  it happened so fast  maria  how long has nina been here  she was the first one at the hospital  shes been with you the whole time  yo no s porque pero  my mother was murdered before my eyes  makes sense id choose a life  where i search for meaning in blood  the sole memory i have of her is being covered in it  i need to know more details  i hope that look means you found something  on batistas shirt  you should see this  thats what i drove all the way back from the hospital for  this drop of blood doesnt match the wound pattern  or the spatter from the rest of batistas shirt  and look where it is  on the inside of the back collar  angel is stabbed from behind  you think its the attackers blood  we know batista fought back  well run the dna  if this guys got priors  well get a hit on the database  already sent a sample to the lab  all right lets get this together come on lets go  sorry to hear you know  about matthews taking you off the case  last gasp of a desperate man  things are gonna change around here  and i wont forget your help  and im very very angry  oh god no no please  i cant watch this again  i know its tough but just keep your eyes on the monitor  wait  what was that  the camera tilts up  right before he hits the off switch  watch  that my friends is a monster refrigeration unit  he needs it cold to preserve the bodies we knew that  but check this out  look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling  this room is way bigger  than your standard commercial freezer  most likely it was a custom build  so we should focus our search  on commercial districts  no  residential  you think he built this in his own place  he picks up hookers right  i worked vice  the smart girls know not to go near a factory  or a warehouse unless you never want to be seen again  how do we know  he didnt knock out his victims  or drug them  then take them back to a warehouse  none of the other victims showed any signs of head injury  or narcotics  besides what better way to trap a victim  than to get her to walk into your own home  the escort service said she was meeting her client  at the corner of brickell avenue and coral way  and her body was found at santas cottage  which is on biscayne mall  well map out grids  well focus on private residences  drawing large amounts of power near those areas  we catch a break  well catch this son of a bitch  wait where the hell are you going  i need to do some research on a case  you were supposed to call me after your lunch with rudy  ive been freaking out  he sent me this text message  cum sail away with me  he misspelled come  dexter  this is no time to joke  this is good right a romantic weekend  what did he say to you  oh wait no dont  dont tell me  maybe he wants it to be a surprise  unless i should know should i know  okay  tell me  you know no dont  we need to talk  who says that unless youre getting dumped  i dont think thats what this is about  he probably wants me out on the water in case i make a scene  you know i always do this  i put myself out there i set myself up to get hurt  he wants to be part of the family  what  wait  like  propose  i have to get to the library before it closes  but well talk about this later okay  oh my god  oh my god  i was never one to dwell on my past  always content to leave it a mystery  no details   just a blur of images rushing by  but my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus  so do i  this is it for the metro news for 1972 through 1973  the tribunes archives  103  103  same as the hotel  same as santas cottage  this is what he wanted me to find all along  close your eyes  dont look  laura moser  my mother  no wonder i felt so disconnected my entire life  if i did have emotions id have to feel  this  october 3 1973  laura moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw  apparently a drug dealer didnt appreciate  laura and her friends stealing his cocaine  first officer on scene was harry morgan  youve been busy  a crime that big  and yet theres no record of the case file at city hall  that seems a bit odd dont you think  its a long time ago  what is in that report that harry didnt want me to see  why was there no mention in any of the newspapers  about a 3yearold boy at the crime scene  camilla  damn it i need to know i need that file  i cant give you the file cause it no longer exists  i destroyed it the day your adoption went through  you did what  made a promise to your father  why to protect him  to protect you  harry had a code  hed never ask you to destroy evidence  your father was a decent man and an honest cop  but what he saw in that cargo container changed him  you were left there for days  starving  in blood 2 inches thick  yeah  dex codys run away  are you sure  yeah ive looked everywhere  well call the police ill be right there  okay  camilla  i need to know the truth  kid  leave this one alone  i cant sit here like this  i should be out there doing something  rita the police said you need to stay here  in case cody comes home  the neighbors are helping well find him  yeah but one squad car for all of miami  what if some crazy person picked him up off the street  its all my fault  honey what are you talking about  i should have heard cody get out of bed  im his big sister  hey hey look at me  its not your fault okay  okay  could you go get dexter some water  god  i should have seen this coming  cody was so upset with me  when i told him that paul was back in jail  paul  todays thursday right  yeah  i think i know where cody might be  hey  need a push  todays the day you meet daddy in the park huh  hell be here  oh baby im so sorry  but hes not coming back   not for a long time  look well talk about this when we get home okay  after all the lies harry left for me to uncover  id love to run away too  he wont even look at me  im not the one in jail  and yet im still the bad guy  well you didnt tell them the truth  about their father  i told them paul was back in jail  well right you told them where he is  but you didnt tell them who he is hes still the same   drugusing wifebeating redneck he always was  they should hear that  youre not a parent you dont understand  you do anything to protect your kids  rita wake up youre not protecting them  youre protecting paul  well i  i got to get them home  somebodys in a good mood  the commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning  theyve been in matthews office for two hours  you thinking his ass is about three shades of red right now  i dont care what color it is  as long as its on its way out the door  tell me that did not just happen  its who you know and who you blow  probably picking their fucking tee time  maria watch your back  hes gonna be gunning for you now more than ever  let him try  my man juan hook it up  they didnt have road and track so  that better be a bag of applesauce  okay juan at this point you should go save yourself go  you got to be kidding me  two doublemeats  a mans got to eat  youre so cute when youre annoyed  you know your mouth makes those little os  god damn it angel  do i look like im being fucking cute with you   well not now you dont no  why do you always do this   make light of things that matter  okay im sorry okay  when i come home ill eat anything you want  no jokes no complaining  i promise  when you come home  i thought the way things are going with us  i thought youd forgiven me  well of course i forgive you  i forgave you a long time ago  okay so lets fix this  this could be a second chance for us  what  look you did what you did  it was hard  but it got us to face the truth  we were miserable  for years  do you really want to survive this  and go right back to being unhappy  maybe  what if i do  look you will always be jorges father  i will always care about you  ill always be here for you  but our marriage is over  why yes by all means tom please come in  maria  lets you and me have a talk  congratulations on the review i hear it went well  you must be thrilled  but now if you dont mind   let me get right to the point  all our mishaps these last few months   failure to bring in the icetruck killer  mishandling of tony tucci  even neil perry   neil perry was your fuckup  not mine  theyre all the result of a bad command structure  and thats my failure  well  im glad to hear you say that  takes a big man to admit his own mistakes  so this morning  the commissioner gave me the goahead to restructure the division  effective immediately you will no longer serve as my lieutenant  im sorry i know this must be difficult for you  please its ridiculous  you really dont want to do this  because of your status in the cuban community  im a fucking hero to this community  you think theyre just gonna accept it  your replacement has already been selected  her name is esm pascal a transfer from fort lauderdale   a real upandcomer  pascal the haitianamerican  the one who got shot last year in the line of duty  turns out shes an actual hero  you think im gonna stay quiet for this youre out of your mind  i did warn you maria  im gonna need you to clear out this office tonight  expect a call from my union rep  you want it youll always have a place in the bullpen   and my fucking lawyer too  with all the other detectives  this isnt fucking over tom  you goddamn son of a bitch  oh you got to be kidding me  how are you  how the hell do i look  i can barely remember how i got here  look theres something we need to discuss  if you came for an apology you wasted a tank of gas  sit im not finished  fuck you  astor and cody are in the other room  jesus you brought them here  look i know this will be difficult  but i need you to explain to them why youre in this place  i have no fucking idea why im in this place  fine  fine you want to be in denial go ahead  you will never see your kids again  wait wait wait wait rita wait wait  i fought so hard to win those kids back  especially astor  if they see me here like this im gonna lose them forever  paul  the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids  and i know you love them  but if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them  it has to be with the father they have  not the father they wish they had  now you cheated on me  you broke my heart you broke my bones  and i took it  so those kids wouldnt have to  but i am giving you the chance to make it all right  but not for me  for them  i wouldnt know what to say  tell them youre paying for your mistakes  its a valuable lesson  its one you never got  so whats it gonna be  okay   daddy  daddy  hey  all right this wont take long  there was a drop of blood  on the back of your shirt that wasnt yours  so i need to check the back of your head  just so long as its only my head youre checking back there bro  how are things with you and rita  not so good actually we kind of  had words i think i really upset her  thats rough man  maybe im not the right person for her  some people are meant to be alone right  dex socio  alone sucks   hijo de puta  sorry  teeth marks  you definitely wounded this guy  good  i hope i broke his fucking nose  or at least gave him a fat lip  angel have you ever met debs boyfriend rudy cooper  yeah i went by his office a couple of days ago  nice guy  why  at lunch rudy said hed hurt his lip that morning  he was lying and i was too distracted to care  but hes got my full attention now  hey you here tonight  yeah were titsdeep in the icetruck killer  might be onto something its gonna be an allnighter  so that text message you got from rudy about going away with him   youre not gonna do that  tragically no  i was all psyched to meet him at the miami beach marina but  this bullpens my home till we finish this   good  good  im working on a theory that rudy was gonna propose  and now he cant  why is that good  no i meant good that youre making progress here  yeah were getting closer  fingers crossed  at least i know my sister is safe tonight  which gives me time to check out my own theory on rudy  weve defined the area for the residential search  good  so well start canvassing tonight you take the   that him  yeah howd you know  cause you got that stupidass grin on your face again   go

fakey hour got it  all right ill get out of here as fast as i can  ill see you soon  thinking rudy attacked batista doesnt make any sense  hes a loving boyfriend  he spends his life helping people in need  he brought me steaks  well thats just rude  why would loving and helpful rudy  need an industrialgrade lock  and a security camera  how do i get his dna now  at times like this  i wish the truth was more easily accessible  and less   ripe  but harry taught me to trust my gut  people lie all the time he said  but your instinct will never fail you  some blood from a cut lip perhaps    i believe your rule specifically prohibits such action  did you do all this  in fact  i did  you like  i like  i like so much that it makes what i have to tell you that much harder  oh please tell me youre not leaving  im sorry  i hit traffic it took me 30 minutes to get here  i have to turn around and go right back  oh my god hold on  hold on wait  well youre sort of forcing my hand here  i wanted to wait until we were out in the water but  here it goes  i know this seems fast  but i feel   i feel that i waited my whole entire life for you  and now that youre here  i dont want you to leave  debra morgan  will you marry me  i knew it i fucking knew it  is that your version of a yes  yes yes yes yes but   no no no stop at yes yes i like that part  yes but lets slow it down you know  like let me

but  theres a condition  i know you have to go to work but  if youre gonna wear the ring we need to celebrate  one glass of champagne thats all i ask   rudy i   i mean it  you cant leave your sortof fianc  on a yacht with a cold meal  and an unopened bottle of champagne its kind of cruel  just one glass of champagne  to celebrate  and then you can go back  saving miami from the icetruck killer  i can live with that  hey i need these two tested against each other  its kind of a rush  excuse me hi  hey these two  tested against each other right now  okay  its deb do it  hey i know youre working

drinking  tastes like menthol  which it turns out is not that sexy  whats the matter  nothing  just bad memories  thats right that was the   the one clue  the icetruck killer left behind right  right  wait how did you know that  i dont often make mistakes  but when i do they haunt me  hilarious  your champagnes gonna get warm  you know the one thing  ive been dying to ask you  how did you not know who i was  youre a cop  this isnt funny  i think a real cop would  at least have a sense that she was in the presence  of the person she was hunting right  youre hurting me  i didnt show you the best part of my loft  built it myself  stop it  the refrigerated room  oh god why are you doing this  you know the tricky part was getting you on the boat  the other women i could just pay  but at the end  you made it easy  so desperate to fall in love  stop  dude you got to see this  the autopsy on our santas cottage victim check it out  one arm was shorter than the other so that got me thinking  i mean our guy isnt sloppy   hes precise  not now vince  her left wrist was 2 inches shorter than her right  i mean why why cut off more on the left side than the right  because our girl  our girl was a fucking amputee  i looked up her medical records  she had a fake left hand thats why we couldnt find it  the killer cut off that extra piece of wrist  so that we wouldnt see the stump  let me see that  that night batista was stabbed  he was following up on a lead he got from a onehanded call girl  guess what the lead was about  the icetruck killer  booyah   you sure  positive  the samples you gave me were a match  theyre from the same person  hey you all right  wheres my sister  took her code 12 left about an hour ago  she went to dinner she wasnt supposed to go anywhere  dispatch this is dexter morgan  i need you to raise officer debra morgan on her radio  sorry sir shes been out of range for the last halfhour  its deb do it  where the fuck are you  im here at work and youre not i
