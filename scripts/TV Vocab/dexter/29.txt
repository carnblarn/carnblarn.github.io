here to make friends  im here to do my job  ive known you your entire adult life ramon  so lets cut the bullshit  youre using this case to insert yourself  into miami metros investigation  of your brothers death  if our victim can help track down  my brothers killer in the process  so be it  as one lieutenant to another  you know i could go over your head  and get you pulled off this assignment  but im not gonna do that  i know you and oscar were close  and he meant a great deal to me as well  so you will have  this departments full cooperation  to a point  if it turns out that these cases are not connected  the cooperation ends  entiendes  claro  i need to thank miguel  for introducing me to a new hobby  and for supporting an old one  after the first wifes money ran out  ethan didnt take long to find  the next wealthy woman to woo marry  and throw overboard  maybe i can return the favor on that last part  have both tanks delivered to the ship  ill need a dive skin too  you got it

our bowling team  only because you wanted to keep everyones handicap higher  to sandbag the other teams  okay thats true but  not one person read my paper  not one fucking person showed up at the conference  i spoke at  this is about your stupid paper  you guys just dont get it  you hurt my feelings  what the fuck  wheres the kid  the mother wouldnt give consent  i had to cut him loose  did you explain to her how important it was  that we talk to him  the moment i brought up freebos name she clammed up  word on the street is the last person  who talked to the cops about freebo wound up dead  i spent all day  getting through to that kid  he would have talked or he would have  convinced his mother to let him talk  she was never gonna cooperate  you coulda waited until i got back  look this is no reflection on the work you did here  no its a reflection on how little  you think of me and my work  you think i cut this kid loose  to make you look bad  im not sure anymore  partner  hey baby  you want a date  hey sugar what you look  you have got to be kidding me  im not here for that honest  your  you know your  youre blushing  im not  so what uh what are you doing down here sergeant  cause i gotta get back to work  i came here because i  i wanted to know if  if youd like to grab something to eat sometime  you know to talk  and to eat  im not interested  i rarely date cops  rarely does that mean never  if i meant never i would have said never  dex is that you  im in the kitchen  what smells so good  its a surprise  look brochures of houses  i know its fast  but syl and i spent  the whole day doing drivebys  and these are the ones i fell in love with  all of them  well theyre in great school districts  big yards plenty of bedrooms  central air  i thought we could go through these  after dinner and have syl  schedule some showings for tomorrow  i understand that as man and wife  rita and i will have to live under the same roof  so why is it the only word echoing in my head is  no  no  okay i guess we dont have to look at all of them  no  no doesnt really work in a relationship dexter  can we talk about it is a little more productive  im sorry but i dont want to look at houses  not now anyway  fine thats all you had to say  uh if syl and i go out to look  tomorrow in the morning  can you watch astor and cody  no im going fishing tomorrow  im gonna be gone all day  and you were gonna tell me this when  rita this is the first im hearing about house hunting  i cant just drop everything at the last minute  because you want me to  dinner will be ready in five minutes  its a roast  your favorite  i doublechecked ethans ship itinerary  hes in bimini today only  gives me one shot to head him off at the pass  sorry rita but right now i need this  more than a big yard and a twocar garage  let me guess syl  she might have mentioned  that rita and she were going house hunting  because a certain gilipollas  decided that hed rather go fishing  gilipollas  you dont wanna know  so this is the boat you keep talking about huh  wow shes a beauty  you gonna take me out on her sometime  sure thing  so what brings you out here  thought maybe we could grab some food  before you go out  you know kind of like a rain check for yesterday  ah cant leave the boat  everythings onboard  olvidete okay  dont worry about it  so where are they biting  um heading up north mercy reef  always had good luck there  you know i got half a mind to postpone the arraignment  that i have and just  go with you  please dont  nah  i gotta be in court  im gonna try to put out some fire  that your lieutenant started  but im glad i caught you you know  hey how bout whatever you catch  we put on the grill tonight  wish me luck  thanks for coming in early  lieutenant prado  wanted to get us all up to speed  on the skinner case  thank you  this is our vics boyfriend  now no ones seen him since the night in question  we could use your help tracking him down  soderquist ramos youre on it  i was also hoping i could speak with a couple  of your previous witnesses  speak with as in we didnt do it right the first time  cases evolve  witnesses change their story  junior personnel they make mistakes  no disrespect  actually its a lot of disrespect  youve come into our house twice  you not only insult our police work  now youre insulting one of the most dedicated officers  ive ever partnered with  yes you  its bullshit my man  lets not lose sight of the fact  that we want the same thing here  to find whoever is responsible for these murders  uh there is one slight problem  your case has nothing to do with our case  the vic wasnt skinned  not like our previous victims  there were minute traces of ink  in the papillary and reticular  english  someone dug out a tattoo from the back of her neck  postmortem  which is another reason why  i dont think were looking at the same killer  its all right here  in the county medical examiners report  thats your opinion  my lab thinks differently let me see that  youre not taking this seriously are you  in a fucking heartbeat  do you know how many times vince masukas been published  hes our lead forensic investigator  and theres no one better  our victim was strangled  the same as yours  petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes and bruising  would lead one to conclude  strangulation  unless youre me  you were so busy playing hide the sausage  with the mes report  you were hoping id miss the cotton fibers  in the nose and airways  your victim was smothered  thats not opinion thats science  and science is one coldhearted bitch  with a 14inch strapon  and hes back  well i think were through here  im not so sure your lieutenant would agree  sergeant  then you dont know her as well as you thought  lieutenant  ethan  apparently ethan is looking for more  than adventure on the high seas  both of his deceased wives had prenups  in a divorce he would have been lucky to keep the rolex  but he wanted it all  ethan made a choice  and pretty soon youre gonna have to make one too dex  ethan chose to be rich  rather than married  i on the other hand chose to stay with doris  even after  you cheated on her  you think you and i are so different dont you  im nothing like you  really  youre here and ritas back home  youre cheating on her  and you dont even realize it  ill make time for my dark passenger  and for rita  its about priorities dexter  youre gonna have to choose which one is your mistress  and which one is your wife  and more importantly which one comes first  harry you missed a spot  oh hi baby  hi mom  attention all atlantic sun cruise passengers  this is bebay your cruise director  the next sea taxi is leaving bimini  for our ship in 20 minutes  it looked much bigger from out here  well you could always knock out a wall or two  its easier than you think  how bout the kitchen  wall the bay window was nice  but those cabinets  dont get bogged down in the cosmetic stuff  how did it feel when you were inside  like a home  god youre good  youre my friend rita  i wouldnt put you in something i didnt believe in  and i believe that this home can work for you  for your family  what are the rules about using the bathroom  in a house youre showing  no rules you gotta go you gotta go  all right  can i see your venture passport sir thank you  keep coming  excuse me sir  can i take a look at your venture passport  thank you  maam could i see your pass  thank you  attention all atlantic sun cruise passengers  this is bebay your cruise director  the sea taxi is departing bimini  for our ship in five minutes  also please remember that the last sea taxi  of the evening leaves the ship at 1045 tonight  all visitors guestsanyone who doesnt belong on board  must disembark at that time  itll be tight  but i think both ethan turner and i  will be off the ship by that time  of course only one of us will be doing so  because he wants to  rita  im bleeding  oh my god  all right theres a hospital five blocks away  waiting for an ambulance is only gonna take time  what about dexter  well call from the car  those things will kill you you know  ill talk to you later  ive been by here four times looking for you  what for  the other cop said you couldnt talk to me  well hes right i cant officially  but unofficially  theres no reason you cant call me  just in case theres something  you want to tell me about your exboss  burgers fries and onion rings  you know i know the situation with your mom  not being around really sucks  but if things get really bad  you use that card and call me okay  i kept my nose outta freebos business  it was safer that way  do you have any idea where he is  no  i know he was into someone for some major cash  he was pretty scared  thats probably why hes hiding out somewhere  well that explains why someones  trying so hard to find him  they want their money back  so are we done  were done  oh yeah one other thing  yeah  when you find that jerkoff  tell him he still owes me three weeks pay  thanks  watch yourself out here okay  okay  miguel thank god youre here  how is she  they rushed her up to prenatal icu  but they wont tell me a thing  im not family  miss  hi my name is miguel prado  im an assistant district attorney  i need you to find your chief of staff  dr reynolds and have him call this  yeah im just an admit nurse youre gonna have  hey call him  right now  i feel so bad for rita shes all alone  baby baby reynolds is gonna make sure  she gets the best care in miami  why isnt dexter back  ive been calling all day  goddamn it the father should be here  i enjoyed shuffling through your ipod  to make sure that no one hears us  of course most of your shipmates  are up on the blue deck  its happy hour just the two of us  oh its too bad i have to make this quick  im usually all for a stimulating conversation  at times like this  but the last sea taxi leaves in an hour  ive been going through some changes myself lately  im getting married  ive got a baby on the way me  even though my life may never be the same  i want to thank you for reminding me  how important it is to take time for oneself  savor these moments alone  and here i am  paradox personified  taking life  creating life  with the ship anchored away from shore  the gulf stream will be ethans last cruise  bon voyage  this isnt like dexter  somethings wrong  sweetie i know this is difficult  but you need to stay calm  i sent the coast guard out there to look for him  he wasnt at his fishing spot  so maybe hes back

you sure you dont want me to  thanks  what  hello debra this is miguel prado  have you heard from dexter  uh no why  well were at the hospital with rita right now  hospital everything all right  debra we need to find your brother  ethan turner was incapable of compromise  he loved his wives money more than he loved them  and in the end it cost him dearly  i dont wanna be like ethan  maybe my days of coming and going as i please  are over  but that doesnt mean my life is over  not as long as i have my boat  and the open water  there are some things i can keep to myself  you have 12 unheard messages  dex its me  im on my way to the hospital  i think theres something wrong with the baby  the baby  the babys fine  they said if i stay on bed rest  the next few days  that i can  we can go home tomorrow  i dont know what i would have done  if id lost the baby and you werent here  and nobody could find you  im here now  and im not going anywhere  i think maybe we should wait  to find a house until after were married  just name the date  im ready  id like to walk down the aisle  before i start to show  whatever you want  i may never be able to feel  our babys heartbeat emotionally  but i know now i cant ignore it either  and for some reason i cant explain  im relieved to know its still here  fishing  thats where you were all night  deb  you cant make me feel any worse  than i already do  well i hope this was a big wakeup call for you  cause youre gonna be a father before you know it  yeah i see that now  my life is changing  and if itll make you happy my place is yours  whatll make me happy is you being there  for that kid  for homework  and plays  and softball games  dont you dare be like dad  thats never gonna happen  quite a night huh  i should have been here
