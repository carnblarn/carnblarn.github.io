                 previously on dexter  its always the same three kills with trinity  young woman in the bathtub  followed by a mother falling to her death  and ending with a man getting bludgeoned  trinitys likely someone  whos gone his own solitary way through life  foregone all but the most rudimentary  of human connections  a lone wolf  if we can find where he bludgeoned back then  lobbys open 24 hours guard on duty  too much foot traffic  trinity would have  to choose another floor  ooh so sorry  wasnt watching where i was going  white male  eyes blue  something in them  super agent lundy has a hunch that the dead woman  is connected to this big serial killer case  you still dating that shebag reporter  after she put lundys name in the paper  tell me is this conversation  going to end up in the paper too  cause you have no idea  the shit storm youve gotten me into  find yourself another source  just unsealed the juvie records of johnny rose  our vacation murder suspect  shoplifting with his high school girlfriend nikki wald  get down  i think we should inform the brass  about our relationship  its none of their business  i get a gig in town to spend more time with you  and you spend all your time  with your ex  dont go disappearing on me again  not a  deb  hey you  back behind the line  no i was called here  im dexter morgan that might be my sister  i

okay  its looking good  who did this  we got here just before you did  quinn was first on scene  he says its smelling like the vacation murdersm o  then thats  lundy  what was deb doing with lundy at 500 in the morning  oh  dexter i swear to you we will find who did this  my kits in my car  hey hey hey  you got better places to be  like with your sister  go thats an order  youll know the minute we know anything  lundy was a worthy adversary  he deserves better  than to be face down in a hotel parking lot  a random victim of a senseless crime  sorry about deb man  did she say anything  she was in shock  didnt see who pulled the trigger  batista said you think  this looks like the vacation murders  debs cash and credit cards are gone  sos lundys watch and wallet  anything vince  surgeon general wouldnt have been able to save him  gsws to the neck and chest  he bled out in seconds  lundy was shot twice  deb was vulnerable and a potential witness  the shooter could have easily finished her off like lundy  i should get to the hospital  deb she knows  even though we go at it all the time  were still  yeah she knows  were gonna get these fuckers  not if youre looking in the wrong direction  detective quinn  not now really  i didnt come here for a quote  you all right  my partners been shot  the last thing i am is all right  i know this cant be easy  but if you need anything  im here for you  thanks christine  that means a lot  i got to  its okay  all right  sergeant batista  no comment  come on sergeant  is this the work of the vacation murderers  i said no  on the record  its too early to tell  but one of em johnny rose  we found out has syphilis  and its real bad untreatable  multiple partners  print that  with pictures  i call it in now  itll be online this morning  and on the stands this afternoon  with pictures  while my colleagues  are working the vacation murder theory  im gonna follow lundys theory  and check his hotel room for clues  lundy devoted his life to hunting trinity  he left word for me  hed had an interesting encounter  two days ago  you think it was trinity  every crime scene is a jigsaw puzzle  so many pieces  assemble them right  a picture forms  if it was trinity  itd explain why deb is alive and lundy isnt  trinitys a monster  if he was the one who hurt your sister  you need to kill him  that was my blood down there too  you cant let these be logged into evidence  not until i have a complete picture  police so far are refusing to comment  on the murder of a former fbi agent  and the shooting of a miami metro  homicide detective  but channel nine has learned  there may be a connection  to the so called vacation murders  sources tell us that  all right denver omelet side of rye toast  can i top that off for ya  coffees fine  but there are no diced tomatoes in my omelet  im sorry about that  cook is slammed today  ill bring you a side of tomatoes  hows that coffee  my coffees not the issue  my breakfast on the other hand is  you need to start over  denver omelet with tomatoes diced  coming right up  youre a dear thanks  astor will you get that  but its dexters  oh its okay  he was in such a hurry he probably forgot it  could be the hospital  is aunt deb gonna die  oh no honey no shes gonna be okay  some man he says hes dexters landlord  theres something wrong with dexters apartment  oh theres got to be a misunderstanding  uh yes hi this is rita morgan  how long have you been there  not long  youre sitting up  its a good sign  im fine  i didnt even need surgery  couple stitches  looks like more than a couple  you have any pain  no just tired  whatever they gave me has some kick  you want me to come back  its okay im fine  you remember anything at all  you see anything unusual  its all still a blur  who was hit first  you or  jesus dex  am i squeezing too tight  i expect those kind of questions  from batista or quinn  but not my brother  you said you were fine  twice  doesnt matter anyway  just tell me what you want me to do  thats just it  you cant do anything  no one can  i didnt feel anything  i didnt even know id been hit  until i was on the ground  and then two more shots  so much blood  youre safe  im here  lundy had this look in his eyes  like he was apologizing  i couldnt do anything  i was helpless  fuck i cant even walk  three feet to the bathroom  do you need to  yeah bad  come on  okay  mmhmm  i may not know who shot my sister  or why her life was spared  but i do know i wont be returning the favor  oh god deb is she  peeing  ill justuh  be outside  hey  hows deb  shes lucky to be alive  i was so worried  can i see her  uh shes peeing  with anton  i would have been here sooner  but i got hung up on the phone  your landlord called  a pipe burst in your kitchen  at your apartment  oh  i was just hanging on to the place  until the lease ran out  so i could get the security deposit back  whyd you tell me you got rid of it  i said that  talk about this later  this isnt the time or the place  not with deb here  family comes first  im just so sorry i wasnt here  you dont have to keep saying that  so glad youre all right  im not  babe what is it  i slept with lundy  i thought you were happy  i thought i was too  i can move out  no no no  listen ill see you through this okay  you did the same for me  anton stop  you deserve so much better  is that what you want  sorry i hurt you  anton  gracias  just hung up from notifying lundys daughter  then you could really use  a shot of whiskey in there  i get that the guys personally invested in this  but matthews hovering around like a vulture  isnt gonna help us catch bad guys  angel  i made official disclosure yesterday  that were seeing each other  we talked about this  i know  but it was the right thing to do  i said i was uncomfortable with the disclosure stuff  and you go ahead and do it anyway  i made a judgment call  the problem maria  is that you made it for the both of us  you shouldnt keep the deputy chief waiting  what do we got  not much  no witnesses no security cameras  took a statement from deb  she cant remember seeing anything  forensics  waiting on trace and ballistics from the lab  apbs out on rose and wald  countys increased patrols at the airport  and the higher profile tourist hotels  if my face was all over the media  for shooting a cop and a fed  id be digging a fucking hole  all the way to china  no one fuckin go there  or youd be watching the press  to try and stay one step ahead of us  its a hail mary  but i planted a story  with quinns girlfriend  shes not were not  youre the papers unnamed online source  about johnny boys drip  i figure if johnny has syphilis  and nikki wasnt listed by the county  as one of his sexual partners  she may not know  exactly  maybe we turn these two against each other  rita was right  family does come first  finding who did this to my sister comes first  is this a new page of the code  revenge  my sanctuary  its private and sacred no more  if i have to give up this place  what will i do about my roommate  the dark passenger  this apartment is the only thing  thats helped me keep the mask in place  without it  ill burst  theyre letting me out tomorrow  thats great  any chance you can give me a ride  of course  im also kind of gonna need a place to stay  i broke up with anton  and no i dont want to talk about it  we can make room for you  rita wont mind  dont worry deb ill take care of everything  trinitys a lone wolf  unable to connect  except with his victims  he never deviates  bleeds out a young female in a bathtub  forces a woman to jump to her death  and five days later  bludgeons an older male  ill look at potential sites  this may be the closest to trinity ive ever been  lundy got closer than he thought  he just couldnt see how all the pieces interlock  what they form  a sacred ritual  if theres anyone who knows the importance of ritual  its you  lundy underestimated  how far trinity would go  to make sure his ritual  wasnt interrupted  lundy was an obstacle  and trinity killed him  if anyone has ever deserved to be on your table  its this son of a bitch  can i help you  im taking on a project  how big  almost more than i can handle  and i dont have a lot of time  maybe you need another hand or two  theres plenty of laborers out there  no no i work alone  sounds like you need the right tool for the job  so much work  but i have to finish what i started right  yeah ii guess  what would you do  me  oh id go with the framing hammer  got a lot of heft  its versatile  you cant go wrong  i see what you mean  youve been very helpful  lobbys open 24 hours   trinity could strike anywhere  hell have to set up shop in the surveillance room  trinitys the perfect predator  camouflaged waiting for his victim to be alone  and then he strikes  trinity struck here 30 years ago  a bartender father of two  was found bludgeoned to death  in the mens room of a tavern  at this same address  if history is going to repeat itself  this is where trinity will be  problem is you have no idea who youre looking for  lundy was so methodical  he would have commented on trinitys physical appearance  if their paths had ever crossed  but theres nothing in his tapes  ive listened to them all  you sure about that  thats your recorder  wheres lundys  it wasnt in the hotel  because lundy had it on him  must have been logged into evidenceshit  dexter you need that tape  you need to be certain  its trinity on your table  theres still time  he wont complete the cycle until tomorrow night  and ill be here  waiting  oh god  oh  that was uh  unexpected  thats not an adjective i usually hear  im not complaining  im just  im just wondering why youre really here  my way of saying i appreciate you running that story  for my boss  okay hmm  you fucked me to thank me  technically i went down on you  to thank you  i thought you said this was just too complicated  you being a cop and me being a reporter  i guess i like complicated  look whos here  sorry astor  i promise it wont be for long  its okay i get codys room  sorry cody  come on guys its time to go to school  check in later  everything all right between you and my brother  we just need to have a talk  it isnt about me staying here is it  no youre family youre always welcome here  im gonna let you get settled in  and im gonna get you some water  for these pain pills okay  rita  thank you  thanks for letting deb stay with us  it was either here or your apartment  look we cant keep putting this off  its still not a good time  i need to get to the station  so when do you suppose  itll be a good time  to discuss why you lied to me  im really trying here dexter  dexter  im just asking for a little patience all right  not for me but for deb  right now i need to focus on finding who did this  okay  you didnt come over last night  so little time to sleep lately  i thought id get more rest in my own bed  im sorry i went behind your back to matthews  it was wrong and i apologize  if you havent noticed  im a bit of a control freak  you mean like how like to guard the remote control  with your life  or how you need to be the first one in the shower  or how you like to  look the reason i went to the brass  was because itd be  one less thing to worry about ruining what we have  the only thing that would ruin what we have  is if were not honest with each other  no more secrets  no more secrets  then im not going anywhere  thats everything collected  from the parking lot and the hotel rooms  back there on the right  thanks for doing this  my father gave deb the ring  and it means the world to her  i checked the inventories  masuka never logged it in  yeah deb doesnt remember if she was wearing it or not  the shooting has her pretty messed up  if my coming down here to double check  helps ease her mind  so be it right  yep  ah fuck  damn it  you morgans and that mouth  do you mind  oh yeah dont sweat it  theres plenty more where those come from  thanks  here you go  guess who just found her ring  sorry for the trouble  thanks a lot though  no problem  i appreciate the personal tour  any time i can do rounds  with a fellow human being is a win  youre alone every night  yeah economys a bitch  there used to be two of us on every shift but now  oh say no more  im recently laid off myself  from here on out im gonna be my own boss  well theres plenty of office space here  you know more tenants means more money  then maybe i wont have to do these double shifts  and i can see my kids once in a while  oh you end up setting up shop here  i guarantee thisll be your favorite destination  come lunch time  right on schedule  and you brought me a customer  its a future renter  well possible future renter  can i get you any  no no  caffeine makes me a different person  appreciate the offer though  so you say you walk this whole place  every two hours  thats quite a workout  my wife calls it lowimpact aerobics  or some shit like that  it takes about 45 minutes  give or take a smoke break  well we all have our vices  so howd you like the building  its perfect  great  thanks a lot  mmhmm  rita i think somethings wrong with harrison  i know that cry  someones wet isnt he  good  thought it was me  oh no  no harrison loves his aunt deb  can i ask you something  i dont do diapers  did dexter tell you he kept his apartment  what the fuck  are you kidding  he told me he got rid of it  me too  just thought he might have said something  since you two are so close  not a word  god its like a morgan family curse or something  make the worst choice possible  at least dexters dont get people killed  you think youre responsible for lundys death  he never would have been anywhere near that parking lot  if it werent for me  is that why your pain pills are in the trash  punish yourself  what happened to lundy isnt your fault  you had no control over it  this isnt about choices  or even about you  sometimes bad things just happen  thats the answer to this  bad things happen  life happens  ive yet to find trinitys signature  at any of his crime scenes  trinity moves from state to state  law enforcement never links his kill cycles  to one another  over 30 years of killing  the cycle the ritual  they tell me where trinity will be  but i have to know who im looking for  i have to be sure  lobbys open 24 hours  guard on duty  too much foot traffic  trinityd have to choose another floor  ooh sorry  bus number 432  male  maybe 64   age around 60  hair gray eyes blue  something in them  lundy saw a ghost  okay listen up everyone  i just got word there was a shooting at a motel  you all need to get there as soon as possible guys  so quinns already en route  angel youre with me  masuka grab your stuff  whats going on  motel shooting  bodys a match for johnny rose  im going with you  you cant work this  youre next of kin  ive got it  lets just hope deb  is finally gonna get

bermuda  hell hath no fury like a meth addict scorned  your office lieutenant  waswas that a smile  i dont know  congratulations maria  that was really good police work out there today  thanks  but it was sergeant batistas good police work  yes  well i know hes an asset to your team  but this department cant risk  a defense attorney turning your romantic involvement  into a courtroom sideshow  every time you work a case together  what are you saying  i am saying i need you to transfer sergeant batista  out of homicide  tom this is bullshit  we followed protocol  christ he made this bust  which is why im going to make sure  that sergeant batista gets a promotion  along with his transfer  have the papers on my desk by monday  sergeant  fuck what is it  while everyones chasing their tails over nikki wald  im going after the man who really shot my sister  in a few hours the enigma that is trinity  will be on my table  a riddle wrapped in plastic  morgan  i need to see you  im kind of in the middle of something  can it wait  no  well im way over on the other side of town  itll take me at least an hour to get there  im not home  im where frank was shot  you cant even see our blood  its like it never happened  deb  what the fucks your problem  i got here as fast as i could  you have everything  and youre doing your goddamn best  to throw it all away  rita told you about the apartment  what the fuck were you thinking  you have to make this right  im not sure i know how  you figure it out  im the fuckup in the family not you  dont say that  you have a choice  to be a good husband  to be a good father  i know  its just uh  sometimes i feel trapped  by what  three kids  a wife who adores you  yesterday i had lundy and anton  and now theyre gone because of me  you didnt do anything wrong  it doesnt matter what i do  or what i choose  im whats wrong  theres nothing i can do about it  if im not hurting myself  im hurting everyone around me  theres nothing i can do about it  imim broken  im  no youre not  i am  why dont we go back to the house  dont dont  i need to be here  where lundy died  i cant do a fucking thing about it  my sister doesnt deserve to be in this kind of pain  but i know who does  trinity hurt my sister  and im going to hurt him back  and its going to feel uhoh  your manager let me in  he had no idea we were married  funny thing is im getting to wonder myself  rita youre upset  i actually convinced myself  that by coming here  this would all make sense  why it was so important  that you keep this place a secret  as i was coming over here  all i could think about  that you were using drugs again  that you were having an affair again  that will never happen  i went through your cabinets  rifled through your desk  looking for anything  that would explain  what would be so horrible  that my husband would have to keep a place  to hide it from me  or his own sister  and  i was gonna break the lock  but i was too scared of what i might find  and you know why  cause you put me in this position dexter  this is not the type of person or wife that i want to be  you really want to know whats inside  yes  it was harrys  i wasnt comfortable having it in the house with the kids  so i kept it here  see  i have nothing to hide  except for the syringes scalpels and bone saw  hidden in that secret drawer underneath  nothing to hide  like your car accident  and your concussion and this apartment  the most disturbing thing  about your lying is that  im beginning to see  just how good you really are at it  you should sleep here tonight  when youre ready to come home  we have a lot of work to do  if this marriage has any hope  hey pulling an allnighter  yep no rest for the wicked  have a good one  always do  its almost poetic  one serial killer  ending the 30year reign of another  trinity could be anywhere in this building  ive got to get  to the security surveillance room  huh wheres that security guard  he was here last night  ive been so focused on trinity  ive neglected who his victim might be  the bludgeoning victim 30 years ago  didnt he have two kids  its the security guard  if hes here  then wheres trinity  aah  take the bait  take the bait  oh no  please  im a father  you were no father  aah  you made me  you made me  the recording disc is gone  where are you trinity  oh my god  you made me do this  trinity  shit  the elevators arent moving  hes using the stairs  which one  i cant risk picking the wrong exit  and miss trinity  his car has to be here  no way i lose you again trinity  in miami nobody sees  hes scurrying back  to whatever hole he crawled out of  the lone wolf thinks this is over  asshole  what the hells he doing  where are you going trinity  stay with him  hes not getting away  he doesnt belong here it doesnt make sense  hi honey  mmm missed you  hey kids  daddy  hey dad  lundy was wrong  i was wrong  neither of us  knew pieces of the puzzle were missing  trinitys a husband  a father  hes  like me
