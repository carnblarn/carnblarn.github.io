are we on the national database   we ran it nothing came back  got a call into interpol too  should i invite quinn  hes so tan  first someone loaned freebo some money  and is willing to skin people to get it back  that same someone is drafting off our investigation we are being watched  which is why i wanna use our ci more aggressively  you mean anton  yeah were gonna spread the word that anton knows where freebo is  youre gonna use him as bait  ramos soderquist i wanna put anton under surveillance immediately  thats his name soderquist  youre gonna tell him right  all due respect sarge we tell him he bolts  two of my witnesses have turned up dead you wanna see a third  antons already got a target on his back by helping us   this will protect him  yeah right  ok look im gonna keep anton in the dark for now  but i want eyes on him at all times understand   hey deb  what  are you gonna bring a date to the wedding  i dont know dex i might be too busy picking up pieces of antons skin  to

crime scene  ah  fucking mess  city pays for the tree trimming but not the cleanup  we all cant live in highclass neighborhoods morgan  yeah im sure you live in a real dump mr cadillac  ms owens i understand you have some new information about your sons murder  yes i do i found this  thats my card  it was in wendells shorts  the ones he was wearing that night  the ones he got killed in   i am so sorry for your loss  you stay the hell away from me  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa   i didnt mean to  you didnt mean to what  you came to my house you talked to my son and i told you not to  you gotta go back inside  you led that animal here right here to my only baby  and now hes gone  wendell is gone because of you  hes gone  marriage children you never expect it to end in tragedy  unless youre me  i want all civilians cleared off the street were gonna be rolling out a body  lisa morton college valedictorian on her way to harvard business school  found the murder weapon under the sofa  screwdrivers consistent with the wound  the perp must have used it to jimmy the front window  i figure the girl heard it came down to check it out  took a swing at the perp missed knocked over the lamp  the perp freaked stabbed her ran  apparently without shoes these are sock prints   socks  yeah looks like he cut himself  or stepped on the victims blood  no if it was hers the prints would become less saturated as he ran away  and got back to the window  but theyre more saturated see  blood belongs to our guy  fucking socks  run it through the criminal database see if anything gets kicked back  ill bet you a night of lap dances i already know who did it  albert chung  got arrested six months ago on a be knocked an old lady down some stairs  and he did it all in his socks  same old lady identifies the wrong guy in the lineup  shoeless schmo walked  how do you remember that it wasnt even a homicide  chung is asian bro he makes us all look bad  and taking off his shoes can anyone get more clich  well he probably did it to keep quiet or to not leave shoeprints  so he leaves sock prints  frickin moron  and asians are supposed to be smart  fuckin albert chung  fucking albert chung  fucking albert chung  first an old lady now a college valedictorian  well weve matched his dna to the blood at the crime scene  mug shots on every media outlet someone will turn him in  first i got ramon drinking himself into a stupor  then i got syl nagging me for attention  and i got scumbags like albert chung running free  well the departments working on that last one  and what if they do catch him eh then what  his attorney got him off once  ill lay you odds that chung walks again  icoo  no you and i  we should take care of this ourselves  theres a lot of wrong in the world dex just ask lisa mortons parents  argh  slice  i guess it cant hurt to keep tabs on chung if the police cant bring him in on their own  hell let them have albert chung hes just the symptom  we need to go after the root cause the one responsible for putting him on the streets  his bloodsucking soulless defense attorney  ellen wolf  she got her client off isnt that her job  her job is to uphold the law  but ellen wolf she twists and bends the law until its unrecognizable  has she uh  ever actually killed anyone  chung wasnt the first evil fuck that she put back on the streets  the body count is piling up  if she hasnt done the deed with her own hands   dexter youre being too literal  i dont think i am  do me a favor ok  keep an open mind about her  let me show you some files no pressure just research  move your back foot to the left  excellent  yes  ellen wolf doesnt fit my usual code  but in the interest of friendship i said id keep an open mind  camillas request for the perfect key lime pie is much less complicated  im not eating this crap get it out of here get it out of my room  all right honey its gone dont you worry  shes having a hard day  got some news  bad news huh  tumors worse  no  its slowing goddamn it  doctors gave me another month  another month of struggling to breathe  of shitting myself  of this stupid fucking wallpaper  im im sorry  i already lived through this with gene  the endstage  all i want is to be on the other side of it  he at least had me  and you have me  ill bring you as many key lime pies as you can stand  gene wanted me to end his life you know  i would have done it if i could have  its kind of illegal  its more than illegal  its a mortal sin to us catholics  oneway ticket to hell  i cant take my own life either  but  youre not catholic  no  im definitely not catholic  but i do live by a certain code  of course you do  harry taught you right  so what im about to ask you is  the most terrible thing anyone could  camilla i dont  just help me  please  youre strong  and a good friend  no dont dont answer now  just think about it  she couldnt have asked a better person taking lives is what i do  but never someone innocent and certainly not a friend  get in  whats so important you had to see me at the asscrack of dawn  do you have any outoftown relatives  why you wanna take a vacation together  ok  whats going on  uh  i heard a rumor about you  that you know where freebo is  you know that i dont  im just telling you what i heard  and the other cops heard it too  which means that the skinner will be looking for me  shit this shit is crazy  ive got nothing to do with freebo except for helping you  and no one knows about that except for the cops  wait are you telling me  am i being set up  jesus and here you are asking me about outoftown relatives   everybodys got one  so you want me to go  i want you to survive  i dont wanna lose a good ci you know  listen you telling me me leaving  its not gonna help you any  ill find another lead   so i guess i should go  good  you watch that mouth of yours  fuck you  the code has always been my guide why should this be different  taking an innocent life could be a dangerous precedent  i cant just change the rules for a friend  or maybe i dont want to  but i can honor miguels request to research ellen wolf  keep an open mind  murderers rapists carjackers  set free to commit more heinous crimes  maybe my code could include the person who unleashed them on the world  hey you  hey did you get my messages   the list you need my list  asap  working on it right now  thank you dexter  we still dont have a head count so i cant start looking for a venue  itll all get done i promise  just made an appointment with the florist we can drive by after carapan  id be having a complete meltdown if it wasnt for you syl  believe me im happy for the distraction  from what you have such a charmed life  on the outside in front of company  but miguel when were alone hes  syl what  he just  he goes to this dark place  i know he lost his brother and now his other brothers in trouble but   that would put a strain on anybody  but hes being secretive hes never home  he says hes with dexter but i think its a cover  are you sure youre not reading into it  i went through the same thing with dexter he was disappearing acting weird  what happened  he was  he  he was  going through a difficult time  rita tell me  he was doing drugs and he was having an affair  dexter  god if someone like dexter can do that  look we hadnt defined our relationship yet  it wasnt like you guys it was different  but the important thing is that i confronted him  we talked about it and it actually brought us closer together  you just confronted him  well i mean if you dont deal with your problems they only get bigger right  dexter really  i know i know  theres no way your nickname was worse than fatista  cause gianna just rolls off the  vagianna  ok you win kids can be cruel  fatista huh  you can call me whatever you want  ah too soon  its ok im very patient  actually angel i  i think youre great but  but i hate that word  i like spending time with you  its all right you can say it  you want us to be just friends  i i like our friendship you gonna make me feel bad for that  no i like it too  but you want more  you gonna make me feel bad for that   you rang  ellen  i didnt expect you to come over  i didnt expect you to call  so  im starting to think im too close to the prado family  i know one side of them maybe theres more   there is  such as  broad strokes  uh missing evidence witness intimidation jury tampering  ive got details you wanna hear em   you have proof  hes a bad guy hes not a stupid guy  mmm  he couldnt have changed that much  hmm maybe he didnt  my exhusband was always a prick i just didnt wanna see it  its a little hard to take in you know  its about to get much harder thats actually why i came in person  miguels on his way over here right now  what why  to negotiate the terms of albert chungs surrender  youre not representing albert chung  chung saw himself on tv and called me im here as his counsel  you call miguel prado a bad guy while representing someone like that   its not my job to judge maria  well youre certainly judging miguel  and if he ever gets arrested i will defend him too  fucking albert chung  that dipshits photo has gotten more primetime play than any asian face in years  way to represent  it also got over 600 tipsters calling in folks up in arms over this one  hey guys  i need your addresses for the wedding and i need to know if youre bringing dates  can we bring just friends  i never bring dates to a wedding  best man always hooks up with the maid of honor  the maid of honor is ritas daughter shes ten  masukas your best man   i uh hadnt really  why   are you asking batista  cause id be honored hermano  um uh i dont  im not having a best man  well what about ushers  i need back copies of your reports on the skinner cases  all of them   you looking for anything in particular  something anything  i need a fucking lead dex ill be here all night if i have to   diligent  not really  did you ever  you know compromise an investigation for personal reasons   never  figures   where did you get these  camilla  shes in a lot of pain  then i hope she goes fast  not likely  just shoot me if i ever get like that   really  hell yes  id do the same for you  pull the plug put a pillow over your head whatever  id never let you suffer  you wouldnt would you  dexter will you bring the prelim blood report on lisa morton to the briefing room  miguel prados asking for it   hes here  he and ellen wolf  to negotiate the terms of albert chungs surrender  wear your flak jacket  im not interested in your terms counselor albert chung needs to turn himself in  if you want albert chung i suggest you get interested counselor  preliminary blood report as requested  id actually like dexter to stay  ms wolf might need a forensics expert  to explain to her how hopeless her case really is  oh please do stay  dexter  he wants me to see how bad ellen wolf really is  this is me openminded  go ahead with your terms counselor  my client requests the news media be present  and that he be allowed to make a statement  he requests the charge be kicked down to manslaughter  youve gotta be kidding  he also requests conjugal visitation  jesus you have no shame  and no case run the evidence from the crime scene will you  blood at the scene belonged to albert chung  dna matched his sample in our database odds are 170 million to one  that its anyone but albert chung  mmm it wont hold up  you do know what odds are  the jury wont not when i get done discrediting you and your chain of custody  i think we all know how easy it is to plant evidence and well  you look the type  do i see sheets of plastic in your future  dexters work is solid ellen  your prosecutor isnt  walk in the park to discredit you counselor  try it were gonna add slander to aiding and abetting   im not the one on trial  oh you should be  you should be getting your brother off with a slap on the wrist  not to mention the chicky hines debacle  all right lets stay on point here  if albert chung kills again while you pursue this bullshit  that blood is gonna be on your hands   or do you even care  like you do  you spout off about justice and the constitution  except for that pesky part about everyone deserving a fair trial  while you set free the scum of the earth for a fast buck right  how many pro bonos do you take on miguel  huh how many innocent people have you saved from fascistic prosecutors   ellen  dont kid yourself  you might as well be walking the street the way you make a living  ok enough enough  dexter would you step outside please  yeah  miguel you know that that was completely out of line  im no fan of ellen wolfs but all i see is a defense attorney doing her job  maybe too well  but i cant kill her for that  now i have to tell miguel no  not what he wants to hear  youre going the wrong way morgan  im just grabbing dinner sarge im gonna do some overtime on the skinner case  what do you hear from anton  hes not answering his calls but i think he probably  yeah thats good ok see you gianna   hey just heading out  yeah um  a buddy of mine is getting married in a few weeks  and he asked me if i was gonna bring a date  and youre the only one i wanted to invite  youre inviting me to a wedding  maybe you dont get the concept of friends  its not a date its its a plus one  the wedding is besides the point  it made me realize that youre the one i wanna spend time with  and if us being friends means i get to keep doing that im in  this isnt some kind of weird end run is it  make me see how sensitive you really are   im not all that sensitive  yeah you are  im confused im  handholding so simple so intimate  so uncomfortable  sorry about the pie  i was told it was the best it got five stars  dont worry about it  until you find me the perfect key lime pie i have something to live for  dexter im so sorry for putting you in that horrible position  asking you to violate your conscience was one of the worst things ive ever done  i want to you help you camilla  if i were someone else id do it  i know  i should have thought about your past before i asked  my past  i know your secret dexter  you think  if you help me die  youll be like him  your brother  brian moser  the ice truck killer  i dont have a brother  you did  i read your file before i destroyed it  your birth mother was laura moser  when the newspaper said brian moser was the ice truck killer  i made the connection   camilla  its all right dexter  ill take it to my grave  and you could never be like him  i had a high opinion of you deb  guess i was wrong  i told you repeatedly to stay out of my shit and you wouldnt  so you told quinn i was investigating him  he did what he does and now the case is dead  you chose the wrong friend  hey youre the one who fucked him not my fault he didnt want an encore   is that what he told you this was about  he didnt have to it was obvious  little miss heartbreak turns a cadillac and a fancy watch  into a fucking ia investigation  how is that even original  what an empty room your world must be if those are the dots you connected  im happily married  seven years working on our second kid  with zero interest in a waste of clothes like quinn  fine  i really dont give a shit  well then give a shit about this  a cops dead cause quinn cut all of the wrong corners  i came to you for help to get him out of circulation  you refused  next dead cops on you  a dinner party washing dishes it seems so mundane  but its oddly soothing  maybe this is what belonging feels like  keep this up were looking at dishpan hands  i should add rubber gloves to our gift registry for dexter   we can do that  oh you can register for anything  furniture motorcycles power tools  power tools  ah jesus sylvia  come on use your brains baby we just got this thing restained   i got it its fine  yeah  uh why dont syl and i finish the dishes and well put dessert in the oven  and you guys pop a movie in for the kids  uh yeah sounds good   movie time kids  come on muchachos  uncle miguels gonna put a movie on for you  sorry about that  he probably invited you guys over so he wouldnt have to be alone with me   things havent gotten any better  worse after i confronted him  oh no  he just completely shut down now he cant even be civil in front of company  im so sorry i never should have said anything  no its not your fault  maybe dexters a bad influence on him  i know wishful thinking  hed be a problem i could actually fix  hes going to bring up ellen wolf and i have to tell him no  can friends do that  so uh ellen wolf  piece of work right  go easy be tactful  we cant kill her  i see  shes just doing her job  you should tell that to the parents of all of those people that her clients have killed  yeah i read about them  i also read about the wrongly convicted people she got off death row  the defense fund she set up  shes fucking with the system eating away at it from the inside out  control dexter thats what she likes  and now shes trying to control me  reopening my cases undermining years of all my hard work  so this is personal  fuck yes this is personal  and it should be personal for you too as my friend im asking you to do this for me   im sorry no  well then fuck you  shes fucking with my life  im gonna go  ive never been great at conflict resolution  not without a blade and several rolls of plastic wrap  did dexter and miguel have a fight  no sweetie did you  uh why dont you guys go get ready for bed  so what happened  you grabbed us outta there so fast  and youve been grinding your teeth the whole way home   i disagreed with him  about the affair   what affair  syl thinks theres someone else  oh  hes definitely obsessed with someone but theres no affair  and theres not going to be one either   what  im confusing my metaphor  well friends fight sometimes  im not sure hed consider me much of a friend right now  hey youre a great friend  the problems his  well either way life was good before him  itll be good after  its all right to be upset  im not upset  yo dex  put me down for a plus one to the wedding  the list right  hey thats a plus one  ok   sarge  yeah  i think morgan needs an intervention shes been here all night   she find anything  i dont know  shes waiting on you for the big reveal  batista may be plus one but after last night im minus miguel  but with or without my help camillas on her way out  its ok im better off on my own  i cant believe this jackass is still on the run  you know he kinda looks like you  that that  thats called racism buddy so dont even  oh shit  he does look like me  i found a fucking lead on the skinner case  in the trees right  weve had our heads up our asses sarge  weve been looking down at the bodies but no one has been looking up  how much caffeine have you had  a metric fuckton  you should stop its giving you tourettes  our second victim right javier garza  im looking through it and i remember talking to this george guy  this treetrimmer george something  it reminds me of that fucking mess at lorna owens house right  where somebody had trimmed the trees and they didnt bother to clean it up  so im thinking trimmed trees treetrimmer   maybe theres a connection  ok  so i go through every fucking photo of every fucking crime scene   and guess what i found  trimmed trees  no i didnt find shit  but when i looked at the homes of the victims  motherfucking trimmed trees  the skinner is using treetrimming as a cover for surveillance  he watches from the trees and when the time is right he grabs them  treetrimmers landscapers blends right in  check city maintenance schedules get subcontractors names  anyone whos worked near any of the victims homes lets bring em in  i still cant get a hold of anton i think he might have skipped town  then its a good thing you found a new lead huh morgan  good work  anton skips town you find a new lead  pretty convenient  up all fucking night  nothing convenient about it  not all of us cut corners detective   you havent been answering the phone  ive been busy  i can see that   i can also see that youre troubled  yeah  that conscience i dont have its been eating away at me  i know ill turn my client in then ill feel better  youre only halfjoking  you wanna bring in albert chung as badly as we do  im here to help  you cant  i can if you let me  if i let you ill be violating privilege  well thats where the help part comes in  see im getting to know you and that granite set of ethics youve got  couldnt crack em even if i wanted to  you know that about me huh  yep  but its your job to make sure albert chung has his day in court  and its my job to make sure that happens  ive got several ways of doing that  for instance sometimes i set up surveillance outside his attorneys office  only an idiot would ask for a meeting here  only an idiot  i am not good at this letting people help me  i know that about you too  why do you think i brought the scotch  deb angel plus one vince maria laguerta  doughnut guy  i see him every day  if you dont know his name hes not invited  we can come back  dexter bring that girl of yours in here  im here im right here  hi its so nice to finally meet you  oh rita  you know ive got it  hey you came  you called   what the fuck are you doing here  i live

i agree  and im about to become a true friend to camilla  my secret ingredient sodium pentothal  coma in half a minute  pancuronium stops her breathing and then  peace  for her anyway  dexter  i have
