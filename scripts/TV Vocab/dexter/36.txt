that evoke a stronger response than our final act  death  what was once moving  speaking  killing  and threatening  becomes nothing but an empty vessel  which is not so different from how ive always felt  several patches of skin removed from the   uh  the shoulder area  ligature marks on the neck  why the fuck would the skinner wanna kill miguel prado  miguel was after freebo  king had to figure he knew something  we all react in different ways to death  some  like ramon  choose anger  others cling to ritual  dex  i know he was your friend  so if you wanna take a pass on this  nah thats all right i got it  me  ill play the grieving friend  who buries himself in his work  you can tell a lot about a person  by the friends he keeps  and this is my best friend  goodbye   miguel  dont fucking

that his death  wasnt gonna be the end of things  so his plan was to make me hire a housekeeper  your suit for the wedding  thats personal  ramon prados like a gutshot animal  you know what to do with a wounded animal  you put it out of its misery  i cant kill him he doesnt meet the code  cant kill him  cant ignore him  i have no intention of ignoring him  i can use the ring  to tie miguel to ellen

man is in custody  jorge orozco  aka george king  affectionately known back home as the blade  orozco was a captain  in the resistencia nicaraguense  the contras  he headed an interrogation unit  he tortured people for a living  and killed em  now this already was a big case  with miguel prados murder  its officially huge  this is whitaker  hi   my name is dexter morgan  im trying to track down your old partner ramon prado  why  im a family friend  sara told me hes been missing since his brothers funeral  i figured with his problem and all  gotcha  actually   i havent seen him since he left  i know a few places he used to hang out at  i mean   basically any bar within a tenmile radius  i can give you a few of his favorites   if you like  im sure sara would appreciate that  yeah im sure  id love to help them with george king  but ive got a more pressing situation to deal with  miguels wounded messenger  morgana minute  sure   sarge  so it took a couple of months and a lot of wrangling  but my budget request finally came through  homicide is gonna get a little extra money  oh   thats great mmhmm  we should get one of those crimesight imagers  have you seen em  their pictures are amazing  really  i mean   thats what youd spend it on  cause i was thinking maybe wed spend it on  adding another detective to our squad  maybe somebody who saved the life of a ci  who idd our skinner

council has voted to name the freeway interchange  near my house after miguel prado  i drive that way every single day  he was a hero  to some  he was a coldblooded killer  he murdered my friend   and now hes got an interchange  im sorry  im sorry  youre the only other person who knows the truth  maybe its time we let others in on the secret  there is nothing to link miguel  to ellen wolfs murder  except evidence that was obtained illegally  and therefore inadmissible  ill find something  ill tear his life apart if i have to  he doesnt have a life anymore  its his family youd have to tear apart  the community the cuban community  and you still might not be able to prove anything  so i just keep it a secret  i hate secrets  we all have them  well   then tell me   dexter  how am i supposed to live with this  you just do  can i get an everything burrito and a side of beans  maybe a little bit of  anton  hey hi  youre here yeah  yeah   i was just   um   picking up some things from evidence

know why until i read em  you slept with our key witness  the adas looking into it  miguel prado was  i dont know what the status of it is now  but its a conflict  and you should have given me the heads up  especially before i sent  my recommendation to laguerta for your shield  youre gonna spike it now  laguerta has final say  but she deserves full disclosure  disclosure really   sarge  did you disclose that you met gianna  because you were out strolling for a hooker  where did you hear that  i  whered you hear that  i know someone in vice  im the only one that knows   i think  its not

famous brothers reputation  something like that  so you dont really have to bother with reality  that must be nice  you know what my fucking reality is  miguel takes me on as a bodyguard  and i ask him why  you know what he says  to protect him from you  did he say why  no  the only one miguel needed  protection from was himself  the man was paranoid  thats not true thats true  you know it as well as i do  look   i spent a lot of time with your brother  but it wasnt 247 i dont know what he was up to  when i wasnt around  neither does syl   neither do you  what i do know is this  you got a really ugly history  kidnapping   brutality   abuse  you trashed my apartment   you followed me  you put a gun in my face in front of my friends  in front of my pregnant fiancee  why   ramon whats your endgame  to hurt you  until you came into our life   everything was fine  fine like what  like oscars drug problem  like miguelsdarkness  what do you know about that  we were close  miguel and i he told me things  he told me how he pushed your father down the stairs  to protect oscar and you  and that he enjoyed it  he fucking told you that  it was me that did that to our father  miguel took it from me made it his story  part of his god damn legend  miguel always had to be the star  he got the looks   the charm  maybe even the brains   but i got the strength  i spent my whole life trying to hold it together  and now its all gone to shit  it doesnt have to  bullshit  those cases youre talking about  the kidnapping   the brutality  that was me sweeping up after miguels fuckups  he wasnt making my problems go away  i was risking my ass to cover his  i know the frustration   the disappointment  of wanting to help your brother and not being able to  wheres your son right now  soccer practice  your daughter  preschool  where do they think their father is  sara told them something ii dont know  someday your kids will be old enough  to see the truth for themselves  just like you did with your father  i know ive been there  the sins of the father go on and on  from kid to kid to kid  unless someoneyou  chooses to end them  ive been there too  you dont always have to destroy a wounded animal  sometimes you just remove the thorn  those dark lines  reticulated veins  oh   holy shit   it is skin  no   more like  more like leaf  so the only evidence we got  from the car that skinner stole is a frigging leaf  you gotta be fucking kidding me  yup tobacco leaf  tobacco  fuckina   wasnt there a  kings   uh   former employer  what was the name  thank you   vince youre welcome

absofuckinglutely  such a familiar situation  such an unfamiliar perspective  george king  so ramon wasnt the only one following me  i underestimated miguel after all  this is the part where my fear is supposed to build  i know his mo by heart  but youre not afraid  no  im not  i am  ive been scared of it coming to this your whole life  a violent end  i tried to protect you  and you did  this is my fault for not trusting you  instead i trusted miguel fucking prado  you did the best you could  i need you to understand something   dexter  so did i  the very best that i could  i hope to be half as good a father to my son  your son  dad  i forgive you  ive never seen you cry before  theyre not my tears   dex  theyre yours  i know   but ive never  ive never felt this  youve never had a son

information out of me  you are lying  you do know where he is  miguel prado tell you that  he wanted me dead  so he used you  he played on your obsession  it probably wasnt too hard  i mean   youre a little singleminded  lets hope youre this talk active once i get my tools  a wolf would chew off its own paw  its survival instinct is that fierce  so is mine  fuck  kings truck   1100  shit  no way i
