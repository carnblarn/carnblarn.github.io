                everyone needs a vacation  in my case its time off for bad behavior  but i intend to make the most of this family trip  that theyre taking without me   shotgun  shotgun   i called it first  i called it inside   it doesnt count if you call it inside   does so mom dexter   how about you switch every hour   want to trade places  i stay home and  you can stuff cousin marlene into some spanx  on her wedding day   i wish i could but things are pretty hectic  at the station   youre not gonna work the whole time are you   ill try not to   you cant let yourself get to that boiling point again  its not healthy  and id rather not have to lie to the neighbor again  if you decide to smash any more security lights   i hate that you saw me that way   im your wife  i want to know whats going on inside you   i dont think you do  just recharge your batteries all right  enjoy your freedom  go wild   right go wild   have fun  say goodbye dexter  goodbye dexter   goodbye dexter byebye   the kids left you a present in the kitchen   just the thing to melt a fathers heart  let the good times roll  whoops  three days  to recharge my batteries  course rita doesnt know ill be recharging  with another woman  officer zoey kruger  pembroke pines patrol  eight months ago officer krugers husband and daughter  were killed during a home invasion  zoey was shot in the arm and foot  she survived obviously  but there was one person who thought it was zoey herself  who killed her family  the one person who always knows the truth of a crime  the blood guy   morgan good to see a friendly face  arent many around here   nice to have an excuse to visit  even if i made it up   with your caseload  i cant believe you have time to write a paper  on feathering in blood swipes   i have a small window for  uh a side project  i remembered at the spatter conference last spring  you mentioned something about a questionable swipe  in a case you were working  who was it cooper   kruger and shh we dont talk about that   zoeys husband shot in the stairway  her daughter in her bedroom  zoey said she was shot twice  wrestling the shooters gun from him  and turned it on him as he fled   that blood swipe  belongs to darius rae  a drug dealer zoey roughed up  the day before her family was murdered  according to her  she winged him in her front hallway   the feathering is textbook  whyd you say it was questionable   because its the only blood of raes  anywhere at the scene   interesting  for my paper   my theory  uh forget it doesnt matter   you think she planted the blood herself   maybe she even provoked  that confrontation with darius rae   thats where she got his blood   also gives her the perfect narrative for the crime  rae breaks in looking for retribution  cops family becomes collateral damage   was darius rae ever arrested   darius rae was gunned down  in a supposedly gangrelated incident  but thats another theory  another day  i try not to think about it  because if im right  theres a monster walking around free   with a badge and a gun  zoey said she aimed at darius rae  but only winged him  but zoey always hits her targets  just ask her husband and daughter  im feeling recharged already  monsters come in all shapes and sizes  sometimes its the very people  who are supposed to be protecting us  a cop a parent  the spatter guy   god close the door will you  heres a bludgeoning from july   the one were looking for will be five days  after the suicide  right  heres a middleaged guy from october   sorry i thought this was my lab   were hiding from laguerta   quinns reporter fuck buddy has now officially  fucked all three of us   catching the vacation murderer  may not be the departments top priority  detectives spent last thursday indulging the pursuits  of retired fbi man hunter  frank lundy   its a good picture   im guessing that lieutenant laguertas  opendoor policy with me is about to close   weve got to narrow down trinitys next move   bludgeoning  final kill in his cycle   and hes repeating his pattern from 30 years ago  so if we can find where he bludgeoned back then   then maybe we can keep the next trinity victim  from becoming the next trinity victim   wheres masuka   on vacation   hes probably in mexico taking a donkey show tour   theres a briefing in five minutes  agent lundy   my visitors badge is expired   sorry   crap fuck  i guess well have to stake out potential bludgeoning sites  on my off hours   hey  i dont want this theory of mine to jeopardize your job   i want in on this   well okay then   okay then   you ever feel like youre this close to nabbing somebody   sometime in the next 67 hours   its a good feeling   oh my god  i cant believe he posted that   you are so busted  im busted  okay its totally photoshopped  the point is it looks real so  youre busted   shh   i know i know  my dicks been making some bad decisions   so according to quinns girlfriend  these vacation murders are costing the city  a day   well at least the article got the tip line ringing  those assholes cant hide  with all those eyes on them   well those eyes are on us too   uhoh   what oh   that sigh thing you do when you know  theres something im not gonna like   i dont do a sigh thing   okay you dont  what was it that you were gonna say  i think we should inform the brass about our relationship  look its just a formality  paperwork entirely confidential   its none of their business   its department policy for good reason  we will catch these killers  and a defense attorney could use the details  of an offthebooks romance between us  to sensationalize the case distract the jury   if they find out   on a death penalty case   okay they will find out  but not for a while  and what would we even report to the brass   well that were seeing each other   what does that mean   what do you think it means   it means its new  were still figuring it out   so this could just be a passing thing   no its not a passing thing   then what is it   i dont know   well i dont know either   im confused  yeah  i can see that   can we just wait   fine   as a cop zoey has been to plenty of crime scenes  she knows what should be there  and what shouldnt  no prints in the blood on the door  which means she wore gloves  she was still wearing gloves when she shot herself  but they were gone when the emts arrived  whered you leave those gloves zoey   easier to think here isnt it  only 52 hours of freedom left  you sure chose an interesting person to spend it on   dont read anything into it  zoey was a challenge thats all   a woman who wiped out her own family  in order to be free   she should have shot herself  instead of her husband and child   yeah except that doesnt get her free  just dead   well she had other options   alimony visitation  trading off holidays there go your weekends   fine she could have moved away   and forfeit her job her home  her only option was to make her vacation from her family  as permanent as possible   there are always alternatives   why do you think trinitys been so successful   he travels a lot  stays on the move   he doesnt have a family   well i do   miss them yet   all right trinity used a hammer  in portland and in fresno  but wasnt it a tire iron in albuquerque  okay all right  well go with the dude that was pulverized by the hammer  where was that  okay what time tomorrow  great  pad thai my favorite  mmm  hows frank lundy   i didnt say that was lundy   oh your voice did  it goes up a notch every time you talk to him  which youre doing a lot of lately   your point   i get a gig in town to spend more time with you  you spend all your time with your ex   our relationship is strictly professional   you twist your hair when you talk to him   you have nothing to be jealous of  when it comes to frank lundy  all right   poker night at home  zoeys police family surrounds her  on and off the job  between her buddy system and her security system  her house will be difficult to break in tonight  but not tomorrow   cunt   what the hell did you just say   youre a cunt  fuck off old man   fucking pussy   you looking to get the shit kicked out of

right  if i discovered those special wonders on my own   any questions just holler   okay  i do have one question  where did zoey stash her gloves  im sure theyre long gone  but they could have left trace evidence  she swiped the door with blood here  shoots herself collapses  crawls toward the kitchen to call 911  did she burn them  if the gloves melted there would be residue  on the underside of the grate   its just for show  who needs a fire in this climate  im zoey i live here  hey   i just thought id stop by  see how the open house was going   oh its a nice place   thanks   family

theres a couple here who have a question  about the hot tub   okay ill be right down  to be continued   sure  a little girls dream  follow the blood  follow the blood  zoey crawled into the kitchen  grabbed the counter to pull herself up  then reached for the phone  giving her a perfect opportunity  to use the garbage disposal   how we doing in here   uh there seems to be a problem with the disposal  oh  oh no no no   its probably just something jammed in there  its an easy fix  let me take a look   youd do that  sure  blue nitrile  the same material found in police protective gloves  if the glove fits   isnt he a doll  fixing the disposal  huh  wasnt broken this morning   give it a try   all right   yay   if i was your wife  id hang on to you  youre so handy   so its either  the cannery bludgeoning or the bar beating   the cannery body was a dump  trinitys not a dumper  he picks a location takes his victims there   so its the bar   hmm   fuckin a  weve found trinitys  oh oh no oh  here here here   fuck me  take the file take the file  no harm  um mind if i   yeah sure why dont you  so uh 30 years ago  a father of two was bludgeoned to death  between the hours of 700 and

like a man  like my heart is blossoming   thats a problem  no  the problem is she wants to disclose  our relationship to the higherups  which ii understand is a formality  i just hate the thought of them knowing   cause youre embarrassed   because once you define it its defined  itsits officially official   youre her boyfriend  exactly   next thing you know youre moving in  your life is gone and its just kids and neighbors  and painted mugs   painted mugs  its a metaphor   for what   look if you want out get out  before you have to do something drastic   i dont want out i dont  i just want to

bother you at home  i was just trying to reach your sister  thought she was maybe with you  i had an interesting encounter today   me too   gotta admit she is impressive  makes you wonder why someone

going to lunch   thats great  beths cafe sound good   oh actually we should just talk here  its more private   yeah  angels a great cop the best i know  but he doesnt understand the politics in this

getting good at this relationship stuff  mm marriage agrees with you  thank you   lundy called last night he was trying to reach you  that is just so  fucking great   okay  looks like the beehive is buzzing  and here comes the sting  youre out of your jurisdiction officer kruger  wait for it  what are you doing   you want info on darius rae  ask me anything   that file was for a case im working   i asked you nicely to leave me alone   you threatened me   you think that was a threat   what are you gonna murder me too  like you murdered your family  your own daughter   youre sick   i know what you did  i have proof   not possible   from the garbage disposal  the gloves you wore that night  there was gun residue on them  i have a meeting with my superiors tomorrow morning  to tell them everything   theres no chain of custody   still itll raise questions  and if you left this much behind  well find something else   youre trying to rape me   im not touching you   thats why you came to my house  and the real estate agent will testify that  you were flirting with me  and then you stalked me here and tried to assault me  and i had to defend myself   except  the blowback of my blood into the muzzle of your gun  will show a flat contact shot  thats highly unlikely during a struggle  you could shoot me center mass  but the low directionality will show  i was in a defensive position  youd have to calculate the exact distance  to create a spatter pattern that supports selfdefense   go ahead  tell them  no one is going to believe you  over me  so please  tell them  everything   you wont give me the chance  im counting on it   debra  youre here  i called because trinity i   shut up   this time she wont come in a squad car  this time it wont be about threats and intimidation  this time its for real  theyre all props  the camouflage of a family man  shell believe them  she has no idea who i am  but i know exactly who she is  marco  polo   shes going to make it look like i walked in  on a home robbery  got myself killed  shes good at creating the narrative of a crime  that hands the first thing i cut off   surprise  help help  help  sorry sorry i was just buying your tickets
