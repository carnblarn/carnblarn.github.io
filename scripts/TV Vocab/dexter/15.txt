                dexter 02x03  previously on dexter  two treasure hunters made a ghastly discovery today  when they found what appears to be an underwater graveyard  in a crevice off the coast of miami  it means there might be a new mass murderer  way worse than the ice truck killer  the bay harbor butcher  thats what the press is calling him  last thing miami needs is another serial killer   theyre so swamped up there they had to bring an outside talent  frank lundys a rock star  the green river killer the dc sniper tough case but he broke it  this is the man who stands between me and death row  with your helpwell find who ever did this awful thing  so lets get a jump start on the bay harbor butcher  with doakes tailing me my lifes been all jekyll and no hyde  paul kept insisting to me  that you knocked him over the head  dragged him to his motel and shut him up with drugs  i hit paul to protect you and the kids  if theres anything left between us youll answer me this one question  and you will tell me the truth  are you an addict  yes i have an addiction  dexter 02x01  an inconvenient lie    my name is caroline   im an addict  hi caroline  i started taking pain pills  after my back surgery  i dont need them for the pain any more  now  now i just need them  and i need duct tape 3 or 4 rolls  running low on heavy duty trash bags  until last time i sharpened my knives  and then i lost my license  tears now its very hard to concentrate in here  how am i supposed to get any work done  my husband says hes gonna leave me  if i dont stay sober  but i have to do this for myself  no self control lost everything  trying to stop same whiney story over and over for  ten minutes it feels like 10 hours  lortabs darvocet  percocet  and anything i could get my hands on  even now  id kill for a vicodin   lightweight  first hit at narcotics anonymous  but i dont belong here  you guys are real addicts  so how was the meeting tell me everything  it was interesting hearing the same story over and over again   knowing youre not alone  exactly   did you get fortune cookies  only the ones with the good fortunes  so did you share or just listen  i just wanted to take it all in my 1st time out  think they forgot  here they are spring rolls  what about a sponsor did you find one  i didnt want to rush into anything its an important relationship  absolutely  ok so lets see your newcomers chip  my newcomers chip yeah   you did stay until the end right  of course i did right  till the end  youre a terrible liar  i know too much about 12 steps programs  to be easily conned dexter  i didnt stay till the endend if thats what you mean  i had some important errands to run  important but am i important  are the kids  yes of course  you just gonna have to figure out how important  cause if you dont work the program and i mean really work it  i just i cant go through this again  all right kids dinner  how important are they  im sure someone with a heart could answer that question  tomorrow ill go tomorrow  ill stay  hold the elevator  thanks  nice dodge last night flooring it through that yellow light  were you behind me  see you tonight   detective will be with you  how long will we have to  we will get to all of you  take their names and keep them out of the bullpen till we figure this out  sue mcmillan  she disappeared 4 years ago  who are they  family members of every missing person for the last decade  including some sad lonely and presumably single woman  courtesy of lieutenant pascal  its not her fault that reporters an asshole  sergeant hold the rest of them downstairs were out of room here  have you seen pascal  pascal is just caught in a cycle of reaction  shes not cocreating her own reality  you know those words dont mean anything right  look around you shes manifesting negativity  its on again   lieutenant  no comment  dozens of bodies found   in that underwater grave site  not dozens  the boss sweater melons look bigger on tv  the operative word is boss show some respect  i thought i was   one dozen two dozens  18 or so   excuse me  have the families been notified  were still trying to identify them  our viewers with information can contact you  yes fine  so police are seeking any leads that can help them identify  the 18 faceless victims of the bay harbor butcher  if you have any information  pascal is definitely off her game  word is her fianc is catching some strange in the sly  thatd do it  the shit stops here give it to me  most of these people wont find answers here  chances are good their loved ones werent among my chosen few  may i have your attention please  first of all i wanna tell you what a great job  youve all been doing on this horrific case  and with the help of the best man hunter in the fbi we should have answers soon  in the meantime the daily work of this precinct  must continue to serve the public so well be dividing up our resources  agent lundy has requested the following officers for his joint task force  officer cook  landy made me lfi   lfi  lead forensics investigator  sorry you got boned but hey no blood spatter  it sucks to be me  actually it keeps me off lundys radar  sergeant lee  detective ramos  officer panko   detective batista  yes  i saw this happening  and officer debra morgan  those calledll report directly to special agent lundy  but lets not forget this is on all of us folks  lets keep our eyes and ears open  the ice truck killer was an amateur compared to this guy  id also appreciate it if your lieutenant would consult with me  before speaking to the press  ill rip her a new one if i can find her  prints fibers trace evidence  no they wont find anything  i followed all of harrys painstaking preventative measures  he knew that nothing stays buried forever  his code will protect me  still i wish my own sister werent hunting me  makes for an awkward family dynamic  so im a fed my suit proves it  the other suits here are feds  but suit or  ugly hawaiian shirt  no offense  were a team  and our first play is iding those bodies  once we know who they are well fill in every detail of their lives  from their huevos rancheros to their crme brle  and get used to food references because  i like food  mr masuka and his teamre gathering dna prints and dental records  the rest of us are going call through cold cases and missing persons files  also i want that crowd out there interviewed  though most of themll be a waste of time  he has negative thinking  you four move them out as quickly as you can  but be thorough if we get even one hit itll be worth it  everyone else work the files  remember ids will lead to a pattern  which will lead to our man  when the manhunt is on the hunted go shopping  not for a new car for my next project  i wont act on it yet  im still laying low harry would insist on that  just getting the research out of the way  someone talked his way into the homes of two women  and didnt leave till they were dead  ann cohen and a month before her  lynn hall  a certain car dealership ran credit checks on both women  both bought cars elsewhere so nobody thought about it twice  but who requested those credit checks  roger hicks  all i need is some dna proof  a cup of coffee should do the trick  how many kids you got  enough  i hear you  when my two came along it was bye bye convertible  of course  theyre worth it  must have taken after their mom  that they do thank god  yeah i tell you i miss my convertible but  the truth my minivans got a much nicer ride   so you own one  the same one youre looking at  i know whipped right but my kids love  the twin dvds theyre crazy about sponge bob you see   actually i do  my wife loves the nav system and all  the safety features and when theyre happy   youre happy  thats right  except the kids and the wife dont exist  and he owns a beemer not to minivan  still hes seemless   impressive  its not flashy but  what did flash ever get me get me pulled over thats what  im definitely not in the flash  you gotta sit in the captain chair though  its like a 747 man manuel hold up  thank you sir  so we should take it out   check out the ride  no im just doing research  ok you dont want a big sales pitch i get that  let me at least pull the specs for you  because truthfully we have a hard time keeping these on the lot  you might wanna grab the test drive while its still here  i think i have all the information i need to make a decision  then youve seen the stowgo seating system right  i have had everything in here  from a soccer team  to a freaking deer carcass it was an accident of course  but i sure was glad for the ample cargo space  not to mention the tainted windows  i can see how that might come in handy  ill just grab the keys  i go to stalk a killer and i end up with a new car   how did that happen  new car  youre getting married  not that i know of  so whats with the mommymobile  im  not sure  synthetic  even rogers hair is a lie  i could learn a thing or two from this guy  whos your daddy  harry morgan  dude the lead forensics investigator of the joint task force  thats who   so you want in on this bitch or not  what bitch  the only bitch in town baby the bay harbor butcher  i got you temporarily assigned   you didnt have to  nothing sexy of course  just some bone marrow collection for dna ids  but itll get you in the tent and you gotta see the tent amazing  say it   youre my daddy  it sounds weird when you say it  i havent been much use since he disappeared  i know im supposed to move on  but  heres a picture of him  he looks  nice  not according to my mother  or the police he was in and out of jail  but  my heart raced whenever i saw him  i brought his toothbrush they say you can get dna off it  you can find him with this right  look thanks for choosing me for the task force and all but  id appreciate you finding someone else   you want off  just as soon as you can replace me sir  this is a chance to solve a pretty important case  most people get into this line of work to do just that  ive got cases of my own backing up  and the precincts shorthanded with all this shit so if you dont mind  ill see what i can do  in the meantime if you could continue the interviews  yeah of course  thank you  most of them have been underwater for years but some  its awesome you cant even tell  the temperature in the ocean floor and the airtight bags kept them intact  i mean a little gelatinous residue sure but  id rather remember my old playmates as they were neat clean little packages   i appreciate the favor vince but  actually youre doing me the favor  i need your help buddy the pressures fucking ridonkulous  glad to be of service  field morgue for the overflow but its state of the art  fucking fbi hey  a good percentage is just bones  must have fed the fish when the bags tore  humpty fucking dumpty right  exactly  they werent meant to be put together again  they were meant to remain in the silent shadows  keeping their secrets  now theyre exposed to the glare  reflecting my darkness like some grotesque carnival mirror  harry was right nothing stays buried  perhaps not even me  looking for my taurus sergeant  keep looking  you dont need to know where im going tonight   and genius me  not only do i leave my works in my girlfriends car  but also all the dead fish from the fishing trip right  then i collapse in her parents house  scare her kids and get myself fired cause guess what  we work together  so now  im 20 day sober  again  hoping to make it to 21  thanks gordon  this meeting recognizes lengths of sobriety  with chips  so  if theres anyone whod like a newcomers chip  youve got 3 minutes to share if you want it  really  go ahead you among friends  well i  whats your name  hi bob  and im a  an addict  i use  heroine  shoot it  its affecting my job my boss found my works he fired my ass  but i showed him i spent every penny on my final paycheck on junk  and doctor said i  i almost died  coffee sucks  as bad as the doughnuts  its better next door come on  it is good coffee thank you  so tell me  exactly  how full of shit are you  im not full of anything  it was a nice performance in there  where did you download it from addictcom  look i have no reason to lie  sure you do  we all do   you thought i was lying  i dont know  well it is anonymous  everyone in that room has heard or lived  far worse than anything youve ever done  i doubt it  so youre superjunky  i dont mean to imply that what youve been through hasnt been difficult  but there is no way that i could know what youve experienced right  i couldnt possibly  feel that need  like a thousand hiding voices  whispering  this is who you are  and you fight the pressure  the growing need rising like a wave  prickling and teasing and prodding  to be fed  but the whispering gets louder  until its screaming now  and its the only voice  you hear  the only voice you want to hear  and you belong to her  to this  shadow self  to this  dark passenger  the dark passenger  im sorry but  i need to go  thanks for the coffee  she knows  she recognizes demons  dark passengers  maybe the others can too this program is too risky  especially now  rita will have to understand  you just missed story time  i was at a meeting  thank you  it made me realize something important  really whats that  those meetings are not a good place for me  i know how this sounds but i can do this on my own   you need a program  ive read studies  people are ten times as likely to change on their own as they are   with the help of doctors or programs  so youre quoting studies  i lived this  i watched paul try and fail with whiteknuckle sobriety  im not paul im not any of those people  going to those meetings will do more arm than good i swear to you  im better off alone  i pray you change your mind  what just happened  i though you were staying at ritas  im taking the night off  i though youd be on the treadmill  taking the night off  with no money down guaranteed or well make your first two payments  a night off is good to remember whats important  two women are dead the killer is selling minivans  and i have an opportunity to prove it even if i am laying low  having a victim prepped and ready will take the edge off the wait  i hope  hang on a second ok  whats going on dex  any problems the service center can take care of you   but theyre around the corner  actually the minivans fine  yes id never sell a lemon   im rethinking the extended warranty  ill ask the warranty writer  im thinking roof rack and premium sound system  going all out  thats great but im with a customer and so  one of my associates will take care of you  ill just wait for you in your office  dna dna come out and play  rogers got you in a box once youre in a box you dont leave without a deal  dont worry youre safe with roger hes the best  im just dropping off this thank you note  i was just leaving  he sent you across the street didnt he   across the street  he told me not to tell anyone too  i dont know how he makes a living  sending all of his commissions to other dealers  maybe he has ulterior motives  or maybe he knows i cant afford this price  after he ran a credit check  trw doesnt lie  so youre single  makes it tougher to afford those big ticket items like cars  houses you rent an apartment  a house i hate sharing walls you hear everything  tell me about it no pets though right  is this a comeon cause its a little weird  must be why im still single  another brunette  single neighbors out of distance  no guard dog  the credit check gives roger all the details he needs  shes next  and i cant do anything about it not until this manhunt ends  harry would insist on it  what  ill take care of it  i know the card is in his name i just wanna check the charges  well this supervisor i spoke with this morning allowed it  yeah ill hold yes  just to remind you that the biscayne driveby warrant needs your approval  ill look at it  and the homicide that came in last night  still need to be assigned right thanks  i know things are awful with your fianc right know and im sorry  but we need to keep clearing that board out there  youre right im sorry  i seem to have had my head up my ass lately  its called being human  ok whos up   samuels and kent are up  put them on the liquor store shooting  and where is the biscayne warrant  right here  simps and hoagy want swat for entry  i think its a good cautionary measure given the weapon charge  excuse me im gonna need a minute  just gonna need a minute  ill handle it  youre not taking my calls  and now youre checking my credit card charges  rogers dna matches the semen found at both crime scenes  irrefutable  if i do nothing another woman dies  is that my longdormant conscience talking  or the dark passenger whispering  hi its me  hi dexter  kids home from school yet  colleens bringing them home now  im a  little confused  im sorry youre confused  it is pizza night shall i pick up the usual  did you go back  to a meeting thinking about it  the kids and i will order in then  so  this is it  its up to you dexter  i want to know where is she  m teresita shes so young  sevenyear old  you heard me   i know you find her  well do what we can  dont cry  only english angel  just tell her well call her  she thinks you can find her daughter  but there are no kids down there  tell her i cant help her  i cant help you  its been 24 hours since i asked to be replaced  has it  whats taking so long  every cop on the damn force wants in on this case just take your pick  ive been wondering about that actually  everyone wants on but  you want off  i told you ive cases  i dont think so  jesus i just dont wanna be on your task force alright  why  because im the last person in the world that should be on it  you want me to find a serial killer i was engaged to one for christs sake  what kind of cop   what kind  thats why i chose you you know  because of what you went through  you survived  i dont know how  i cant begin to imagine the strength it took  continues to take  more than that  you got a firsthand look into the mind and heart of a killer  and youre still here  if you can accept that really accept it  you could use it  mix that with some of your strength and  you could catch someone even worse than the icetruck killer  but you have to stop running  finish todays interviews  then if you still want out  you got it  lead fucking investigator  translation everyones bitch  i do have a life you know  you do  just give me a bone marrow dna results  no matches  big surprise  do me a favor on your way out ok  drop these dental xrays at the morgue for me tech should still be there  fucking bay harbor butchers butchering my online social life  sorry  i figured youd still be here  you were a pain in the ass but always a damn hard worker  and of course you knew how to handle the press  come here a minute  the public needs to believe that we can protect them when all hell breaks loose  so i need all my people operating at their highest levels  i agree  should i be worried about pascal  why  you can cut the crap maria  i know shes been awol on personal matters  the press fuck up is huge  and im beginning to hear rumors about erratic behavior   youre asking me because  because youve done the job  so she is out that means youre back in  that makes you her harshest critic and i want it straight  take your shot  you know what erratic means  its code for non male  this is the same bullshit sexism i put up with when i was in charge  i wont dignify rumors captain pascals fine  minivans that way  field morgues this way  ill wait  you should take the night off sergeant  on pizza night no way  whats that girlfriend of yours seeing in a freakshow like you anyway   you have to ask her  maybe i will  what exactly is it you think ive done  i know youre connected to the icetruck killer   could you be more vague  i know youre too careful  your assets are all in cash  you dont belong to any organizations or alumni groups  you were top of your class in med school but you changed for blood spatter  i know you studied martial arts in college  but i dont know what a lab geek needs with advanced jiujitsu  do you know what an easy credit is  i know youre a good liar too  not good enough  sergeant doakes thinks he knows my secrets  but he only needs to look at this  my body of work   to know the real me  suit up if you gonna touch them  im just dropping off some xrays   im dexter morgan  i know who you are  right  looks like the lab techs gone home for the night so ill just  you hoping theyll talk to you  the ones with heads anyway  they always speak eventually  just gotta ask the right question  which is  why were they chosen  looking for a pattern  one doesnt kill this many people in this  careful methodical way without a reason  some twisted set of principles  they would have to be twisted wouldnt they  the worst killers are usually the ones  who think their murders were somehow just  even deserved  leaders have slaughtered whole populations for the same wacky reason  but theres never any justification for killing  well one of course  to save an innocent life  to save an innocent life  how many more bodies would there be had i not stopped those killers  i didnt do it to save lives  but save lives i did  motivation aside  i think harry and lundy would agree on this one  roger the artful dodger  you scared me bro  we have some unfinished business  right the warranty and stuff  listen i cant write you up now the wifes waiting for me  not married   ex i gotta take the kids  you dont have any   theyre hers  nope  ok what about this one  i dont give a shit  neither do i  you were right about the ample cargo space  where am i  looks different under plastic but youve spent an evening here  with ann cohen  you took her last breath from her right over there you remember  youre wrong i wouldnt  no you would and you did  and youre about to do it again thats why were here  no this is crazy  youve got the wrong guy i  i sell cars for gods sake  ive never hurt anyone in my life definitely not a woman   why cant i do that  do what  lie like that  when i thought i was good but you its  i dont lie  ok that one was weak  hey look  any car in the lot its yours  tbird town car you name it yours free ill call it in right now   lots closed  ill have it opened im the manager   the manager is rick boxton  but ive been there longer than him   youve been there 3 months  at the other lot  its like watching someone ski moguls  you just hop from one lie to the next no shame no embarrassment you just  dont give a shit  thats the key right not to care about anyone   or anything  i care   i care a lot  it was a compliment   i dont care either  yes you do   like about your wife  not married  girlfriend then  i saw it the minute you walked on the lot  what did you see tell me  most guys of your age they beeline  right through the horse power you know something flashy sexy  but you you there all alone  no one there to nag you  and you dont even glance at the coupes  the only thing you look at is the minivan  like you can see her in the passenger seat   and the kids in the back  leave the kids out  youre lying to yourself if you think you dont care  shes just a companion really  it started that way anyway  someone who  looked good normal   they worm their way in  yeah they do  and they shut you out  thats what this is about that she shut you out  ok i get it  ive been there  but you cant let her get to you like this  cause theyre all the same  fucking bitches  you do everything for them and then they fuck you shes not worth it  youre better off without that cunt  dont talk that way about my girlfriend  im dexter  and   im not sure of what i am  hi dexter  i just know there is something dark  in me  and i hide it  i certainly dont talk about it  its there  always  this dark passenger  and when hes driving i feel  alive  half sick with the thrill the complete wrongness  i dont fight him i dont want to  hes all ive got  nothing else could love me  not even  especially not me  or is that just a lie  the dark passenger tells me  because lately there are these moments when i feel  connected  to something else  someone  its like  the mask is slipping  things  people  who never mattered before are suddenly starting to matter  it scares the hell out of me  hello  thats all the time we have for sharing  would someone lead us in the serenity prayer  i knew there was something wrong with you  the secrets the sneaking around  now it all makes sense  a lot of cops been where you are  the booze the drugs  it makes the job go down easier  stay clean and stay out of my way and we wont have a problem  and you owe me a new michelin you motherfucker  i have all your forms so well do what we can to bring your dad home  im sorry you dont understand  i dont want him home  just tell me hes dead we need to know hes gone  alright you want closure  i want peace he made our lives a living hell  when hed go to prison it was a blessing but  you kept letting him out  i need to tell my mother my sister that theyre safe  that hes rotting in hell call me when you can tell me that  lundy wait  i think it could be a coincidence but  there are 2 of them  two  missing people with records prison records  interesting  and who typically has a prison record  i dont know  bad guys  bad guys   do you think it could be  a pattern maybe  well run all the victims dna against the criminal database  dc lab is still open  come on lets get to work  dexter what  you were right im sorry  to wake you up but i had to let you know that you were right
