does that mean we have his dna   ill run it through the database  soon as i get back to the lab   go  you come with me   im going  just not where you think   you were convicted of killing your wife back in 79  sliced open her femoral artery  she bled to death in your bathtub   do i need to talk to a lawyer   at this point were interviewing you  to get more or less an expert opinion   see your case bears an uncanny resemblance  to a case were working on now  same mo a la that femoral artery  same house   same everything   no fucking way   yes fucking way  sort of puts you at number one personofinterestwise   i didnt kill my wife   oh no  youre just another innocent man behind bars  for no good reason   the fucking deck was stacked  before i walked into that courtroom  in a death penalty state   you copped to doing the deed  you took the deal   i did my time and i moved on   you moved on to lisa bell   who is lisa bell   the young lady that you killed last monday night  in your old house  whatever sick fucking poetry you find in that  tell us what you did mr noonan   it was muggy for so late at night  and vicky my wife  wanted to cool off in the tub so  i went out to

sewer  and his fingernails are disgusting   our killers meticulous  zero dna left at the crime scene   obviously you caught his case of the shakes   given his rehab history im voting dts   and lisa bell was cut with surgical precision   so detective morgan  are we in agreement here   violent agreement  retired special agent lundy   if noonan didnt kill lisa bell  why is the mo the same as his wifes murder   copycat   of an obscure   do we think noonans telling the truth  that he didnt kill his wife   i believe we do   shit   i have a theory id like to run by you  we could grab dinner review the case  maybe catch a bad guy   iuh  okay i guess  um ive got to cut noonan loose  and make sure he talks to a lawyer  if our side railroaded him into that plea bargain  he could have one fuck mother of a case   you have a good heart debra  pick you up around 800   yeah so ill  yes yes   the boxing arenas at the next off ramp  but i still have miles to go before i sleep  bits and pieces  memory fragments  all i have from last night  looks like i got the job done  almost  blood  i was off my game  sloppy  with harrys code ingrained in me  cleaning a kill room should be

blank  why do you suppose that is   not in front of my baby no     because not remembering saved me   and now if you want to save yourself  you have to remember  if you dont fix this screwup
