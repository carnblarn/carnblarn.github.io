unless theres some other reason you dont want me  to talk to him  i can get you a shield tomorrow  will you get me a shield for being a rat  no  for being an honest cop debra  like your father  i know all about the chicky hines case  he was a big one for the prosecutor  and guess who that was  shit  miguel prado  m6 bayonet  oscar tried to kill freebo with it  its only fitting i use it to complete the task  it was selfdefense  thank you  youre welcome  the grocery store  the modern day equivalent of the serengeti  where the mighty lion goes to hunt  and my weaker brethren reward me with gifts

autographed it  but if you want me to write something personal  just let me know  oh yeah definitely  no match on her prints  no missing persons report  so jane doe  is still jane doe  and freebo  same thing nothing  sugar is so much better than the artificial stuff  dont you think  well i guess  do you like milk or cream  neither  not exactly the chatty type are you  no  quinn morgan  man the phones  man the streets  someone out theres seen freebo  and we havent found him yet  lets go  miguel prado the only living  person whos seen me with blood on my hands  miguel maria  hey how are you holding up  i cant lie  im missing my little brother  every minute of every day  well itll get easier  its a cliche  but its true  i want to thank you  for making dexter morgan available to me  he went to great trouble to help me  understand how oscars  last moments unfolded  why is he trying so hard to be my friend  were doing everything we can  to find the man who killed oscar  yeah i know you are i know you are  thats why i feel like im  in such a difficult situation  what is that  youve dedicated so many  of your resources towards resolving this  hes trying to end the investigation  is it worth it  we both know if you dont catch a perp  in the first 48 hours the chances significantly drop  that you ever will miguel  this is not the time to give up  or even slow down  we will find fred bowman  well bring him to justice  thank you maria thank you  tonight  viernes cultural  come by the beach  grab a beer uh medianoche  right after work  youll be home by eight  i dont know if rita will be up for it  syl already talked to her  shed love to go  then viernes cultural it is  did he say anything  about the chicky hines situation  i still got a witness in lockup  that says hines is innocent  miguel is aware of that  i know  to get around to questioning my witness  i assumed he had already  not as of this morning  well im sure hell get to it  ill talk to him  we got a new murder victim  dumped in the park just like our jane doe  some of his skin was sliced off  it looks like freebo struck again  all right lets get there  it cant be freebo  i killed him  but only miguel and i know that  and were not at liberty to tell  javier garza he was a lowlife pimp  hes the one that connected  our jane doe to freebo  well it looks like freebo  paid him back for that  well i cant say for certain  until i get this under the scope  but im guessing were looking  at something like an eightinch blade  razor sharp  singleedged same type of  instrument used on our jane doe  so freebo killed javier  no he didnt kill javier  one of the treetrimmers called it in  said he didnt see anything  or anyone unusual  it all points to freebo  looks like he got a little hungry  for flesh this time  yeah what the hells that about  do we think hes eating it  theres a lot more cannibalism in this country  than any of you realize  maybe the skins like a trophy or something  or he just likes to hurt people  what do you think dex  well they all sound like good theories to me  way to commit  all right so far  we havent found shit on freebo  but now hes giving us a second chance  so lets not blow it  quinn morgan lets get a canvas going  one block perimeter start with the tree trimmers  why dont you take the tree trimmers  im going to start over here  oh gosh i wonder why  can you come

jane doe  id like to help you  but i really have too much to deal with right now  what do you have to deal with  ritas pregnant  say again  ritas pregnant  youre lying  im not lying  a baby  a

did the doctor say  he asked me a million questions  about my medical history  theres a form for you to fill out too  but i told him you were adopted  i mean  are there any details that you do know  like mom was killed by a chainsaw  my brother was killed by  well me that kind of stuff  no i dont really know anything  its okay  i could go to the doctor  and get checked out if you want  youd do that  of course  im glad were in this together dexter  youll make a good father  you know if you want to  here  itll help settle your stomach  thank you  how are you doing with everything else  good  i feel better about it now  actually kind of excited  good  and dexter  i think hes still  a little overwhelmed by everything  ughmen  theyre such babies they need to be carried  kicking and screaming into fatherhood  i guess theyre just scared about losing  their freedom  dexter  i dont know if you officially  got to meet my other brother ramon  beautiful wife sara  nice to meet you you too  sheriffs department right  thats right  so youre the guy that miguel  is always talking about  oh dont worry  like they say its all good  yeah if good means being part  of the team thats never going  to catch our brothers murderer  my gracious brother  grab a beer  gracias mi amigo  para servir  free beer must be nice to be you  a lot of people appreciate knowing that im on their side  i understand youre soon to be a father  yeah  what some mixed emotions there  no its just  yeah mixed emotions  i dont know whats more complicated  having a father or being one  butits good to know youre not taking it lightly  youll see your way through it  hope so  so uh  our friend freebo  does he come back from the dead  or are the police mistaken  id venture to guess  the police are mistaken  youre positive  miguel hes dead  i believe you  well good  you just uh  seem a little  you seem a little unsettled with the whole thing  thats what hes looking for a sign that im normal  uh to be honest  i havent been sleeping too well lately  just know you did the right thing my friend  and it will never be forgotten  a full day of work an evening of socializing  and now finally  the calm cool aloneness of my apartment  hello nathan marten  cheerios man  my animal instincts are never wrong  hello nathan marten sexual predator  you did four years  at south bay correctional facility  your official status is released  which leaves you free to slither about the earth  miguel  you know i went back to my office  to finish up with some paperwork  and it just  it kept on nagging at me  cono what ramon said to you  i wanted to apologize  ah really not necessary  at least share a drink with me  yeah ill grab some glasses  showing up late at night like this  is it creepy or just what friends do  how bout out here  my father he caught me drinking  from his bottle of rum when i was like 12  he grabbed that bottle he threw it at me  eight stitches right in the back  of my head right there  ouch  he was a college professor back in cuba  once he got married and had a couple kids  he realized  time to get away from castros world  so we came over on one of these old fishing boats  i was like five  dexter  the boat actually sank 50 yards from the shore  my mother she had to grab ramon  my father grabbed me and they swam to the shore  wet foot dry foot  sounds brave  yeah  yeah he was a real hero my father was  he spent the rest of his life telling everybody  what a great man he could have been  if it wasnt for castro  the more he drank the greater he became  i would look at him and tell myself  im not going to be like him  you succeeded  yes i did  you know what the funny thing is  in his eyes  i was a failure  i could never measure up  my father was disgusted by me  disgusted  then no offense to the dead  but your father was an idiot  never said that to anyone before  not rita  not my sister  yeah yeah but dexter  they wouldnt understand  you know that  they dont know what it is to be a man  to be a son  with all the pfffp pressure  you grow up to be exactly the man  your father molded you to be  and still  not be good enough  exactly  it was even harder on oscar  you know by the time he was born  my father was hardly even around  i mean i tried to take care of him  look aft you know  im sorry  that i killed him  to oscar  to oscar  so dexter  i think i have an answer  for our other little problem  yes i think i got it all figured out  all we have to do  is get freebos body we dump it  then i can call ramon  tell him that i received an anonymous tip  about where freebo can be found  that would close the case  and we can all put it behind us  sorry its not possible  of course it is ill help  miguel the bodys gone  ill get it just tell me where it is  hes not going to give up  he needs to see something  ill take you there  tomorrow huh  lunchtime  okay  ill pick you up  but look dexter  youre not in this alone huh  its you and me  together  thats the problem  this whole together thing  hey stranger  shit  all right look  its one thing for you to come to the club  but dont be tracking me down all over the place  i called you three times if youd bothered  to return any of those phone calls  you could have picked the location  no im sorry doesnt work that way  shit  this is bullshit  what do you want  tell me about javier  okay in case you havent heard  hes dead  i have heard what else do you know  that you were one of the last ones to talk to him  looks like having a conversation  with you can be dangerous to ones health  who had problems with javier  i dont know  but im thinking i shouldnt give you any more names  or they might end up dead too  well you better give me something anton  i dont like you talking to me that way  oh im sorry  i didnt realize you were such a highclass snitch  well no part of me needs this  so why dont you just let me out of here  not till i get some answers  what am i your prisoner  look we have a deal  and im not leaving until i get some information  you know something i know whatll make you leave  what the fuck get rid of that  you sure dont want anyone to know  you came to the mens room  with your ci and lit up a little joint do you  fuckin flush it  i cant flush this mama this is premium island lady  if you light that ill arrest you  dont worry theres more than enough  ill share  i told you not to fucking do it  it seems ironic that i  an expert on human dismemberment  have to pay 800  to have myself virtually dissected  check out this brain  this one belonged to a serial killer  executed last month  killed 11 women  then he really snapped  killed his wife two kids and the neighbors dog  why are you showing me this  look  how much smaller the right hemisphere is  this guy sure doesnt process a lot of emotions huh  and you see all this activity  in the subcortex region  thats where feelings of aggression  and violence come from  why are you because  look  its exactly the same as your brain dex  freebos final resting place  how  they dig the graves the day before  they place a tarp over each one  it wasnt that hard  to bring freebo here late at night  find an open grave to place his body in  and then to  cover it up with a foot of dirt  and then the next day  they lower a 500 pound casket on top of him  cover it all up with dirt  hiding a body in a cemetery  youre fucking brilliant  ill just get a judge to issue  an exhumation order now and then we  i need you to not do that  look ive never done this before  i dont know what kind of evidence  i left on the body  hair and fibers  i cant have it traced back to me  fair enough  fair enough  it does leave us with our next little problem  what is that  well we still have someone out there  skinning and killing people  yes we do  and your homicide squad they think its freebo  and theyre wasting time and energy  looking for a dead man  when  the real killer whoever that might be  is out there walking free  well hows that our problem  because justice isnt being served  of course  of course we have to  steer the police in the right direction  how do we do this  i dont have a fucking clue  but ive got a feeling youre not going  to leave me alone until we figure this out  together  what do you think about cowboys  rugged american heroes  no i meant for the babys room  nice  we can do something different if you want  yeah cowboys are  fine  hey are you ready to go  to that yoga class  sure  astor cody  come on lets go  nathan marten  as the sun begins to set  the lowly scavengers reveal themselves  hey its the cheerios man  who  the guy from the grocery store  what guy  the man who talked to me  dexter knows  who is he  hes no one to be concerned about  because in a land of predators  a lion never fears the jackal  and here we go into another warrior pose  feel your hips open up  we are strong warriors  all of us  this is absolutely without a doubt  the worst moment of my life  now lets go into a little freeform yoga  just let yourself dance  i was wrong this is  dust dancing against the sunlight  be as beautiful  as the golden flakes of dust dexter  i could probably kill her  before anyone realized what happened  excellent  now i want all the partners  to turn and face their pregnant women  take your hand and place it on her belly  and i want you to send all  of your positive intentions to your unborn baby  im sorry  i just dont want to hurt you  good morning mr prado  are you satisfied with the sentencing of chicky hines  i am  i pushed for the maximum on this case  and i got it and for just cause  with mr hines behind bars for a very long time  im hoping that the families of his victims  can finally find some peace  thank you  miguel maria  another win for our team huh  i have to admit im a little confused  what happened with the witness i gave you  i thought he had information  that exonerated chicky hines  i reviewed his statement it just didnt add up  i thought it had at least merited  a conversation with him  i see this kind of stuff all the time maria  and i know you do too  scumbags trying to play the system  doing whatever they can to stay out of jail  trust me on this one hm  ms wolf do you have a statement  yes i imagine the assistant district attorney prado  is going to go home now  and strip down to his american flag underwear  and pour himself maybe a nice crimefighting drink  make a few fundraising phone calls  for his upcoming run for da  but the truth is  he just sent an innocent man to prison  for 28 years  ugh he should be ashamed of himself  its despicable  someones got to know who she is  no luck  im thinking of putting her picture on milk cartons  not a bad idea  yeah except nobody would ever drink milk again  why the fuck did you lock up my ci  why do you keep calling him your ci  is there something youre not telling us  youre very curious about me arent you  look at you changing the subject  hey sarge  um can you ask officer morgan  why my cis in lockup  he was antagonistic he produced a joint  i warned him not to light it or id have to bust him  he lit it  i knew i couldnt back down  or hed never have to cooperate with me again  he practically arrested himself  that makes sense to me  you got a problem with that no  good  cut him loose  do i know you  we met at the grocery store the other day  i dont recall  you asked my girlfriends daughter  to help you find the cheerios  oh right right right  so what can i do for you  shut the fuck up nathan  stay away from my kids  what  sorry buddy you got the wrong idea  i saw you at the beach yesterday  with your camera  im a photographer  i always have a camera with me  i know who you are  i know what you are  once  once i made a horrible mistake  and i paid the price for it  i did my time  but im not like that anymore  i learned my lesson  ive changed  you havent changed thats impossible  we are what we are  night  good for the hunter bad for the hunted  nathan marten  is your past the prologue to your future  from the outside he looks normal  but like me his brain is flawed  and he has a compulsion hes unable to control  were really not so different  nathan and i  except that i would never hurt a child  then again nathan has never killed anyone  which means he doesnt fit my code  i have other problems to deal with besides nathan  miguel prado  and teegan campbell  if i take care of one i take care of the other  its a new day in miami  perfect time to help deb help herself  one of the things that makes my sister a good cop  is that shes like a dog with a bone  once shes got her teeth into something  shell never let go  all i have to do is lead her to the bone  hey papa  oh god almost forgot  isnt it great  nice  have you started thinking about names yet  not that i want to push it on you or anything  but if you have a girl  debras a really good name  deb i should tell you  oh my god what happened  nothing happened  its just  im not sure im going to be there to raise the baby  what  i dont know if im going to be a father to the kid  of course you are you moron  deb shut the fuck up  how could you even say youre not going  to be a father to that kid  i mean where would you be without harry  and he wasnt even your biological father  i just think im going to be a lousy father  i dont want to screw the kid up  would you please stop doing that  then stop saying stupid things  i mean first of all who are we kidding  youre going to be a great father  and second  and much more important big dumb brother of mine  this isnt about you  whos it about  the baby  so it doesnt matter how scared you are  how reluctant or unprepared you might feel  the baby comes first  and that baby needs you  so youre just going to have to set aside all of  holy shit thats my jane doe  its about time  are you sure  yeah thats her teegan campbell  it looks like her  yeah i gotta go dex this is big  whats that for  i know you dex  youre the best brother in the world  and you can do this  and if you dont trust yourself  trust me  im the smart one in the family  they look motivated  anything  once morgan here found out  that jane doe was teegan campbell  it was a quick step to find her apartment  and guess whod been hiding out there  freebo his shit was everywhere  all kinds of fresh fingerprint evidence  thats good  fucking guys got an airtight alibi  we checked the call logs  freebo called abby wilson four hours  before the estimated time of teegans murder  we followed up with abby  yeah but get this  shes saying she spent all day in bed with freebo  if that theory holds  that means freebo didnt kill teegan  and there are several calls from this phone  to teegans cell after she was killed  assuming freebo made those calls  he may not even know that shes dead  we know javier was killed by the same person  who killed teegan so  hes off the hook for that as well  i was just telling miguel  how we werent giving up on freebo  now i have to call him and tell him  that hes probably right  freebos probably long gone  looks that way  what is that  you stuck a piece of chewing gum on it  im sorry  this is a deliberate insult against me and my people  come on come on  asswipe  who the fuck are his people  i dont know  little scientists i guess  the lieutenants right  were starting all over here  we need to get out there  and see what we can shake loose  were looking at two cases now  ramos liason with tristate pd  on the freebo situation  quinn morgan  you stay on the skinner  and you need to mend fences with that ci  hes part of that world  we need all the help we can get on this  okay  lucky break huh  seeing that flyer  you make your own luck  and now that ive dealt with teegan  yep  hi its dexter good news  i was going to call you we need to meet  uhokay  today right after work  under the bridge near the beach club  hey dexter  miguel  so you said on the phone we have good news  yes  it was just the other day that i was stressing  the importance of getting the police  off of the freebo trail  and today  suddenly  i get the word that the police  have done exactly that  i dont know how you did it dexter  but im impressed  actually it wasnt me at all  it was my sister debra  youre a little uneasy with compliments arent you  we all need to be liked  i also notice that you always have your guard up around me  oh thats not true  ah its okay  actually its a good thing  i appreciate that youre a cautious man  its actually a very valuable trait to have  especially considering our circumstances  its just my nature  i just want you to know  that you dont have to worry about me  were on the same side here  honestly i try to avoid taking sides  in most situations  there you go again  always being careful  okay  come on  i got a gift for you  a gift  you know when you took care  of my brothers murderer  you gave me uh peace  now let me give you peace  a shirt  the shirt  this is the shirt i was wearing when freebo met his end  thats his blood right there  this shirt implicates me in his death  accessory after the fact  why  because i trust you  i trust you  and i want you to trust me  same question why  because i like you  i like working with you  youre a good man dexter morgan  potencial  youve got a lot of potential in you  sometimes i think that you are the only one  who doesnt know that  so im going to be seeing you again soon  all right  yep okay  is it possible ive actually made a friend  someone i can trust with my dark secrets  or am i being foolish  for even asking myself these questions  hey listen if youve come to arrest me im clean  i dont even have my cuffs  look anton  i feel  not good about what happened  yeah yeah  came on a little strong didnt you  yeah well you kinda pushed me into it didnt you  yeah okay ill admit that  all right so um  i feel not good too  okay  ive even been working on a song  for you  kind of an apology  no fucking way  yeah yeah um  its um  its not done yet  hey you  hey dexter  i was wondering if you were coming by later tonight  if i do itll be pretty late  ive got some work stuff i got to take care of  well do you think you could get a chance  to pick up some milk for the kids  for their cereal in the morning  ill try to remember  he wrote this for me  youre the puta mala flaca  yeah thats me  shes the skinny mean bitch  so here i am again  drawn to the house of a man who doesnt meet the code  but maybe theres another code  a code that says youve stepped uninvited into my world  and thats a place where i decide  who gets to live and who doesnt  i am not like you  nobody hurts my children  milk  thank you  youre welcome  so how was your day  long  you  it was good  yeah mine was good too  took care of some stuff i needed to do  that always feels nice  just sending out my positive intentions to our baby  so there it is  im going to be a father  and raise my child  its what any good man would do  after all  its a jungle out there
