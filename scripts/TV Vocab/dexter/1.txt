he didnt finish no termin   it looks pretty completo to me angel  no no look  he cut the leg in four pieces almost like using a ruler  but this leg is in three pieces  now look he started to make a fourth cut but stopped   its possible he got interrupted  laguertas looking for a witness  working on the motel porter back there  god help him  no blood  i cant think i have to get out of here  dex dnde va where are you going  hey no blood no trabajo  i wish shed stop that its one of those mating rituals  which i really dont understand  but that bloodless body   this guy may have exceeded my own abilities   morning dex  morning   hey dex  hey sue dan   how are the families  good you   see you at the next bloodbath  never miss a party  thanks  salt of the earth these people and they work hard

 sex suit worked captain put me on the case  laguerta wasnt happy but she needs to get laid   i guess so congrats  so you got any ideas yet  nope  well start working on your mental autopsy  cause i

these days youre gonna tell me  i already told you  blood spatter doesnt take up all my time  i like doing it maybe i can help out it fills my nights   you have a morbid sense of fun  thats probably true   you should find a pretty girl  i found you  charming like your father just dont get me fired  then who would i bring doughnuts to   angel una ms  gracias  de nada  just like me  empty inside   where the hell you been  crime scene  what about these  the hotel cokehead murders this dealer and the girl  well this hallmarklooking couple  didnt die by the hands of a professional  no this is childs play messy work   all that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting  you give me the fucking creeps you know that dexter  yeah i know sorry about that   fuck you  okay  is there something i can do  you can give me a fucking analysis on the blood spatter on this killings  you think im here to invite you to my nephews bris  i didnt know you were jewish  shut the fuck up and write your report already  dont even know why i need you  grab a crayon psycho and scribble this down  rival dealer came in two scumbags slashed to hell  dealer stole the drugs  wham bam done and i dont give a shit what you say  because thats what happened and thats who im looking for  hey we are looking for a motherfucking thief dealer   you got it  okay sure  i guess but i should get over there  then get over there already you fucking weirdo   i need it quick  im on it sergeant  the only real question i have is why in a building full of cops  all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul  is doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me   so this killer used a sword  no  probably a very sharp knife  look at the blood spatter look at the patterns  it tells a story  you see this big pond of blood right there  thats from the initial stab  the male victim was standing right here  and  the killer plunged his knife into the shoulder  severing the carotid artery and  blpph   notice the long thick heavy drips  yeah nice  now over here you have nice clean sprays of blood  that can only happen when youre holding something light  and moving quick  nice sharp slices through the body  no splashes no drips clean and easy  this guy knew how to use a blade  so were looking for a sushi chef  yeah sushi chef is possible  wouldnt be my first choice but hey you never know   now what  now i eat  the problem with eating and driving  which i love to do is not being able to employ  the 1000200 hand position on the wheel  its a matter of public safety  but theres always a sacrifice  this  guy jamie jaworski  six months ago i think he fell in love with a pretty brunette  mrs jane saunders   a sweet mother of two married to a successful banker   all living a pleasant life until she unfortunately disappeared  leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever  the cops arrested my favorite valet  but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant  its a good thing i dont bother with them  animals dont like me especially dogs  i dont think they approve  of what i sometimes do to their masters  that dog recognizes me as easily as i can recognize jaworski  or any other killer  interesting taste in literature  his needs are evolving turning violent  hes on the fast track  have you ever wanted to kill anything else  you know something bigger than a dog   yes  like a person  yeah but no one in particular  why didnt you  i thought you and mom wouldnt like it  come here  friday night date night in miami  every night is a date night in miami  and everyones having sex  but for me sex never enters into it  i dont understand sex  not that i have anything against women  and i certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men  but when it comes to the actual act of sex  its always just seemed so  undignified  but i have to play the game  and after years of trying to look normal  i think i met the right woman for me  deb saved her life on a domesticdispute call  introduced us  and weve been dating for six months now  shes perfect because rita is in her own way as damaged as me  im running late ill just be a sec   i have to change  okeydoke  hi dexter  may i say that you look lovely this evening  okay  master cody handsome as ever high five  do the space shuttle  vanilla chocolate and strawberry   no coffee  which one do you think melts faster  ready  ritas exhubby the crack addict  repeatedly raped her knocked her around  ever since then shes been completely uninterested in sex  that works for me  will you be back   of course ill be back  i meant dexter   youll be asleep  no i wont  then ill stop in and well all play cards  texas hold em  give mommy a kiss   ready  yeah  needless to say i have some unusual habits  yet all these socially acceptable people  cant wait to pick up hammers and publicly smash their food to bits  normal people are so hostile but not her  where are we going  they might need me  just stay right there ill be right back   son of a whore  who  talking about this hijo de puta this asshole killer  this maricn savage who makes us work on a friday night  only mondays through thursdays  thats what i always say  of course coo be reasonable who wants to work on a friday night  i have my needs  so cmo ests what are you doing here  i was in the neighborhood im on a date   a date nice  same guy same pattern  bone dry no blood again pero mira esto  theres some small differences in the cuts this time  over here  rough almost emotion  then over here not so much   and then over here  clean  muy bien  yeah nice but look at this  all bone  the killer flayed the skin the flesh completely off   now why would he do that  hes experimenting  hes trying to find the right way  is he experimenting with the head too  what do you mean  la bestia left her tits and took her fucking head  i dont find anyone around here  and god only knows what hes doing with it  hes certainly raising the bar damn  this guy is good   will they catch him soon  i doubt it  the killer is an artist  what do you mean  his technique  is  incredible  im sorry i dont think i want to  i mean im  im not ready  damn it dexter  what have i done now   and why cant i get that neat stack of body parts out of my head  no blood  why did i touch her that way  i need to get back to my work  jaworskis website screambitchscream   the mother of all rape sites  thats it hes definitely the one  now its just a matter of time  before he becomes a drop of blood in my glassslide collection  but i have to wait  i have to be careful  and follow the code of harry  hey dad   i can explain  you and i had an understanding  whenever you get an urge you come to me  you tell me and we deal with it together   i do tell you dad  the hell you do   theres blood on this knife  animals i find animals thats all  are you sure are you telling me the truth  yes  i thought we had this under control  you still dont remember anything from before   you know before we took you in  no  is that why i have these urges  what happened changed something inside you  it got into you too early  im afraid your urge to kill is only gonna get stronger  youre saying ill be like this forever  youre a good kid dex you are  otherwise it would have been a lot worse than animals  okay we cant stop this  but maybe  we can do something to channel it   use it for good  how could it ever be good  son there are people out there who do really bad things  terrible people and the police cant catch them all  do you understand what im saying  youre saying they deserve it  thats right  but of course you have to learn how to spot them  how to cover your tracks  but i can teach you   dad  its okay dex  you cant help what happened to you but you can make the best of it  remember this forever  you are my son  you are not alone and you are loved  okay  preparation is vital  no detail can be overlooked  and the ritual is intoxicating  duct tape  rubber sheets  necessary tools of the trade  you cant bullshit me dex help me out  laguerta has me interviewing hookers  its a waste of time  deb if he was interrupted think  jesus christ right  because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces  shes dumber than the boat people throw her a fucking raft  but now we have a fourth body and the cuts were different  and thats telling us a story the ritual is changing  hes looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it  so he keeps doing it until he gets it right  i could be wrong  so how the hell was your date with rita last night  great  you should try it sometime you need a life  well find me a guy i can trust i need a transfer to homicide bro  then well see about a life  i understand that  it certainly would sound better for the kids to say  mommys on homicide   dont make me hit you  come on  then we could talk about more little morgans nephews and nieces   whats wrong with that  you sound like mom  i just  tell me what you know about cell crystallization   what do you mean  i heard the coroner say it last night  he was talking about that dead headless chick   you got that look in your eye  i was there before you  and i noticed this body looked different than the other ones  the pieces were cold  but meatpacking cold  is that what cell crystallization means  my god why didnt i think of that its beautiful  dex what are you thinking  sorry that makes sense  cold  it slows the flow of blood  why the hell is that important   its just a feeling  thats not good enough  i got to show laguerta and her boys theyre making fun of me  theyre saying the only way i can close a case is on my back  i got to get out of vice dex please you got to   refrigerated truck  what the fuck are you talking about  a refrigerated truck  he wants a cold environment  to slow the flow of blood  clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards  so im looking for a refrigerated truck now  probably a stolen one  you think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there  are you nuts in miami  choir kids just do something  just find my husband  maam the detectives are looking into everything  im pretty sure i covered all my tracks   what do you care about that woman  i dont i was just   you like when women cry you like that  whats your thing psycho  i was just heading to the briefing room  you got no call to be in there so flee  lieutenant this fucking guy doesnt belong  im still waiting for his spatter report  on the cokehead murders  go do that  its okay i dont want to upset anybody  he can stay id like your input  and well discuss your case after the meeting  how about we get started   encontrste algo  nada todava   hazme un favor y qutate la gorra  disclpame   you ready  im gonna shame this bitch  just state your case clean and easy youll be the hero  okay settle down  now has anyone tracked down that witness  come on people someone needs to find something here   lieutenant laguerta  officer morgan  i didnt recognize you with your clothes on  i have an idea something in a different direction  an idea  well please share it with us   cell crystallization  excuse me  a little more confidence please  on the last victim  id like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks  have been stolen in the last week or so  refrigerated trucks like icecream trucks  no not icecream trucks  a refrigerated vehicle  that could cause that kind of tissue damage  a refrigerated truck thats  mobile so hell be harder to catch  a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead  thats very interesting very creative  lets keep looking for the witness okay  we know that he or she is out there the forensic evidence  the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness  now somebody out there saw something  so lets concentrate on finding that person okay  but   just keep talking to all your hookers  thats all for today  what the fuck was i supposed to say the only reason im in here  is because the captain said they had to let me in  but he didnt say they had to listen to you  well right again  so say adis to my career im gonna die a meter maid  stop it deb theres another way find the truck  excuse me dexter my office please  what the hell  what the fuck  are you boning her   no  oh my god   deb wait  shut up  it had nothing to do with drugs  lt this is a waste of our damn time  i think sergeant doakes is right  i read the other reports all the other forensic analysis  everyone agrees the cokehead murders had nothing to do with cocaine  it was a crime of passion  the murderer came to kill the woman not the dealer  he did him quick and got him out of the way  but he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady  and you dont do that unless you have a close  personal relationship with someone probably an exboyfriend  thats who id look for  okay  its a bit of a push but sergeant you should check it out  im watching you motherfucker  jaworskis been coming here for weeks   likes to steal all the copper plumbing  theres good money in that  no security guards  thats good   fuck  talk   what do you mean  i think you know what i mean  no oh god  talk to me about jane saunders  okay i did her   how  in a movie  snuff film   but im not sorry  of course not  no im not sorry either   hello  hey im  im sorry  i mean im sorry about the other night  but look dex i really really need to see you  so can you  can you come by later  you know just for like a little while  i mean im really   all right what are you doing now  im just finishing up a little project  but ill come by later  okay bye  all in all it was a good night  one less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet  no way   give us a minute  hanging in there  this will teach me to tailgate  lets go over this again   im all yours  so all the ice trucks in miami    bit of a coincidence dont you think  sure during business hours  but this time of night a truck like that sticks out  and you followed it  thats right   you never saw the driver  just high beams and a flying head  so then he must have already had the head with him in the front seat  thats weird why would he keep it there  i dont know so he could use a carpool lane  it just seems odd your sister has this icetruck theory  and then here you are to back it up  shes good lieutenant you should give her a chance  you know you should call me maria  but ill tell you whos good  you are  doakes picked up the killer in the cokehead murders  you were right it was her boyfriend  of course doakes still hates you  of course  tell me dexter  how did you get to be so smart  lots of sleep  is it okay if i fill out that report tomorrow  sure thing youre tired   good night lieutenant  ill catch you later  dex its been a while   im sorry  i was worried  i didnt know what to do i called in sick  i mean   are you okay  yeah im fine i was just   im sorry there was another you know  look the kids slept over next door  okay   would you like to come in  okay  okay  i dont want to lose you dex  okay sure  and well i want you  i mean  okay thanks  youre welcome   do you mind  no   it could be the kids  better get it then  hello  cody  cody stop crying sweetie  all right ill come get you  cody just threw up all over colleens couch  i got to go get him   tell me were okay  better than   okay  go be a good mom  okay that was close  ill admit making out with rita was  interesting  but if i dont keep a lid on this  it could be the end of us  i suppose i should be upset even feel violated  but im not  no  in fact i think this is a friendly message  kind of like hey want to play  and yes i want to play  i really really do
