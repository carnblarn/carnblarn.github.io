stranger  ive never killed anyone i didnt completely bet before  whose guilt i wasnt absolutely certain of  i did something wholly inside the moment  and wholly outside the code  something  spontaneous  who did i just kill  freebos doorman  i am fucked  just a matter of time before someone calls it in   hey you  dexter hey  i know its not one of our regular nights but   can you come over  sure everything ok  yeah i just  just missing you thats all  god youre on fire lately  are you complaining  im complying  hey where are you  on my dear  a safe place  god created pudding  and then he

have to go  just a matter of time  morning sergeant  how long for you to get to 118 countant  twenty thirty minutes  i got it dex  got what  only the case thats gonna get me my shield  its huge angel put me on it officially on it  huge  who the hell are you  i bet your wondering who the hell he is  who he is is what makes this case huge  its miguel prado  hes a ada he was put on a mission to put away as many bad guys as he can  you know a safe miami is the only miami  a safe miami and were all unemployed  why does he look so familiar  cause he just made the cover of florida magazine  top prosecutor in the state three years in a row  he and laguerta go way back you know the whole cubano thing  the other guy is ramon prado  miguels middle brother hes a lt with the sheriffs department  made himself quite the reputation for being a law and order hardass  and  oscar  prado  as in baby brother  so much for spontaneity  what was he doing in a dump like this  theyre saying that he was a coach at a youth club  he came here to confront this scumbag about selling shit to his kids  talk about wrong place at the wrong time  tell me about it  find anything  a dead guy with a hole in his chest  if this window was cracked since theres blood on the wall   who shut these drapes  probably the 1st on scene  some dipshit rookie whos still outside puking  so what do we got  signs of a majorly big struggle here there everywhere  single stab wound to the chest you read my article yet   started it so far its really good  awesome  whoever did this  hes already wishing he was dead  someone really stepped on his dick with this one  there were so many lessons in the vaunted code of harry  twisted commandments handed down from the only god i ever worshipped  1 through 10  dont get caught  that i got covered  but killing someone without knowing if hes guilty  id love some help on this one  but my god is dead now  mans best friend hey dex  not today  my sister said that laguerta knows this miguel prado pretty well  way back when  when mi  hey whats up  way back when when miguel was in law school  and maria was just starting in law enforcement they hooked up  hooked up  between us  for maria  miguel prado will always be the one that got away   has the victim  oscar prado   dead  dead from a single stab wound to the chest  the deceaseds brother a d a miguel prado  informed me at the scene  that oscar went to confront one fred bowman street name freebo  for selling drugs to some youth club kids   morgan  this freebos the same guy  that killed those 2 coeds in the everglades and got away with it  so the way it looks oscar prado died a hero  also our team found a shitload of  substantial amount of drugs in the house  any leads on his whereabouts  that part of the neighborhood isnt exactly policefriendly   but im staying on it  talk to me about forensics  evidence indicates this was no hit and run  it was a furious closein battle whoever  or is it whomever  whoevers good  whoever did this got in a lucky shot or  is really good at handling a blade  according to the me the aorta was  cleanly severed in one penetration   not easy to do  any luck finding the weapon  its not on either premises  weve checked roofs sewers trash bins in a 5block radius  our conclusion the assailant took it with him  dexter whats the blood saying  pretty much what everyone else is  i have some secondlevel on scene work to do ill get back to you asap  get it to sergeant batista  full disclosure  ive had a personal relationship with the prado family for many years  and it goes a lot further than the whole cubano thing  sergeant  stating the obvious lieutenant i like freebo for this  me too  morgan  yes maam  hit the streets harder learn what you can learn  all due respect lieutenant  if freebo did this hes not in miami  i mean hes in the wind  we can sit around on our asses  and speculate on where we think the prime suspect may or may not be  or we can actually go and look for him  as a miami prosecutor i have dedicated  my career to fighting crime  to making our streets safe for everyone  every family white black latino asian  deserves  the full measure of our devotion to their  dignity  and now that crime has touched  my family in the most profound way imaginable  i grieve equally for every family  that has been visited with the same  unimaginable news that we have received today  our beautiful city is a city of families  and the  untimely taking  of any of us  touches all of us  my parents  brought my brother from  part of my ritual has always been getting to know my victims  confirming their guilt beyond all doubt  oscar prado tried to kill freebo  then he tried to kill me  no way he was there on some noble youth club mission  hes gotta be guilty of something  arent we all  so i ask again  who are you  two speeding tickets and an illegal uturn  talk about outside the code of harry  harry finds me in a pool of blood  turns me into his own personal vendetta machine  and when he sees the monster he created in action  he kills himself  deb can drink to his honor on her own  any luck in the land of reluctant witnesses  one house i play good cop the next one i play bad cop  but i still cant get shit from anybody in the neighborhood  you know what the problem is right  wait quinn let me guess   the cop part  nope  they dont owe you anything theres no incentive  which gives the balance of power weighing in their direction right  here let me do you a favor  call this guy  tell him you know me  tell him you wanna cash in one of my coupons  coupons  yeah hes a ci from my days in narcotics  youve gotta hook in him but its not coming out anytime soon   what do you want in return  just remember that i did you a solid   what not even a thank you  thank you  stop looking at my ass  detective  officer youre anton  in the flesh  you got something you wanna show me  yeah ive seen him before   really where  in the news  isnt that the guy you let walk on those coed killings  now that there was a fine piece of police work   you know him from the newspaper  yeah i think i saw him on cnn   thats all you got  thats all you got  if its you and quinn fucking with me im really not in the mood  if you need something for that temper i got a man down the street  with  real mellow weed that can take that edge right off  thank you but i dont take advice from drug dealer so  drug dealer  no never that  a drug user  occasionally strictly weed thought officer  then how did you become quinns snitch  i got caught up in a drug bust  quinn said that if i blew the whistle on a bigger fish  id stay out of jail so i listened  attentively  yeah well  it never hurts an occasional drug user to have more than 1 friend   on the force so  thats the thing officer  i got enough friends   im outta here  well you have a good one you here  what about this prado guy  and to determine the impact site  the exact point where force encounters a body  you have to distinguish the geometric differences between  a back spatter a satellite spatter   misting and arterial spurting  gross  shut up  you remember how before when katies dad   was talking about being a surgeon  yeah  and sometimes  how he has to cut into bodies and theres blood  but he saves lives  do you save lives  you know theres good guys   and bad guys  so you catch bad guys  not directly but i help  do you have a uniform  a lab coat  a gun  hes got a badge  its a laminate  thank you so much for taking time from your busy schedule m morgan   to come and talk to the children  it was a real learning experience  looks like i really got through to them  it would have sucked even worse if i hadnt had a dad today  thanks for inviting me buddy  if anyone should have father issues anger rejection abandonment  its cody  and whats does he do he moves on  how does that happen   i was so bad youre crying  no  no its just  its just something i always wanted  you being here for the kids  its all so wonderfully uncomplicated  m morgan this is miguel prado i need to see you  right away  so much for uncomplicated  theyre almost just like a piece of art  thank you sir  but to me its more like a story  tell me that story m morgan  the encounter started over here  the scuff marks on the linoleum  their crumpling the throw rug they all have a directional quality  that leads to  and this  is where your brother and freebo  hes my lieutenants prime suspect  but you know that  there was a brutal struggle  i gotta say it looks like your brother  fought like a hero  but he was overmatched  and sustained a fatal stab wound to the chest  everything about the blood suggest that your brother  bled out almost instantly  he didnt suffer  blood never lies  so now i know how he died  question is why  one more thing m morgan  why would a blood spatter analyst  spend time searching the sheriff departments database for  information on my dead brother  like you sir i wanted to understand what happened here  i thought that  knowing some details about your brothers life would help me  make sense out of his death  in your line of work m morgan  is it usual for you to  get so involved  i just sounded like a prosecutor there  im sorry  its not a problem sir and no  its not usual for me to get so involved  but this one this death  got to me  its just  it seems so unreal  hes gone  yeah i know  so a man dies m morgan  and whats left a soul and what is that exactly   i really couldnt tell you  cause some people say the soul  just lives on forever  i hope not  which makes you a cynic  makes me a scientist  so no one youve  ever loved hasnt died  my father died when i was in my twenties  and you dont believe that  that his soul  or qualities of life force is still here somehow its  living inside you  because i  i should have been there for him   you cant blame yourself sir  its easier said than done m morgan  do me a favor  you really wanna get to know my brother like you say  come to his wake tonight  come see how much and how  how fully  he was loved  ive taken up enough of your day  thank you  these reports final  the blood specimens i collected all came back belonging to oscar prado  trace prints all around the victim all point to freebo   anyone out there talking  no officer morgan was heading up  the usual firewall clammed up witnesses and nonwitnesses so  i put her in touch with an old ci of mine   hopefully should be  quinn  that ci you put me on was totally useless for freebo   sadly its not a perfect world  yeah  for all we know freebo is in like nebraska by now  i guess you dont owe me that favor then   how come he gets favors  he doesnt  but what the ci told me about the victim  he wasnt some hero coach who went into the hood and took one for the team  what do you mean  oscar prado was into freebo for some serious cash  why would someone be into i dont know a drug dealer for big bucks  because oscar prado the pride of little havana was a fucking junkie  thanks maria  good one morgan  shes been in better moods   i didnt exactly brighten her day  no you didnt  excuse me for doing my fucking job  youve seen any other super cops coming in here with any leads  no deb youre definitely amazing   but you got to  i know i know  be aware of my surroundings take the temperature of the room  before i open my mouth i know its a bad habit i admit it  look on the bright side  now that youve given up men booze and cigarettes  running your mouth is the only bad habit you have left  thats right  im a model of fucking perfection  you remember what today is right  how can i forget    you wanted to see me  sientate  i need you to think about  deborah morgans continued involvement on the oscar prado case  you want me to throw her under the bus forbeing a little overzealous  its not about zeal  its about tact and sensitivity  its also about the real world this case is as high profile as it gets   listen  no oyeme angel morgan is  resourceful and tenacious and usually the right amount of pain in the ass  but there are political ramifications  and my history with miguel prado aside this case is just too big for her  just say the word maria and i will follow your orders  becoming a homicide sergeant is more than just a bump in pay scale  its a quantum leap in responsibility  all part of moving up the chain  if i bounce her   she will hate me  your her boss angel not a friend  thats up to you   can i get another cranberry juice  that makes three problems down under  jeez i like the fucking taste okay  i miss you dad   my condolences  thank you for coming  losing my brother is gonna leave a pain in my heart that  i dont think is ever going to heal  you have a brother dexter  no just a one loud sister  what she said back at the station  its okay  i know my brother was a good man  but i cant say that he suffered from the tragedy of perfection  who does  who indeed  hey brother the mayors here  you attacked me with a knife in a dope dealers house  no oscar you certainly did not suffer from the tragedy of perfection  then why does this feel so wrong  why in your death are you still so alive in my life  did you know him well  not as well as i thought  sorry  cuervo black  thanks  harry  what the hell is that  cranberry juice is that gonna be a problem  not even close to a problem but the taste  kind of funky  you know by the time my dad was my age he already had his shield  kind of why im here  im taking you off the oscar prado case  i come up with gradea intel on oscar prado  and im getting tossed off the case for being a little loud  in a nutshell   laguerta put you up to this  it was my decision  ill tell you one thing angel  im not letting anyone get in the way of me getting my shield  theres only one person in this department who will get in your way  who  you  can i get a real fucking drink please  my sister still lives her life trying to please our father  me  im following the lead of an 8 year old kid  im moving on  thank you for last night  it was a nice surprise  this is where i wanted to be  again  all i want is

more than just badge numbers to me theyre my friends  theyre my family  listen  its the sound of your shield calling for help  harry said that what was inside me would be there forever  and that i
