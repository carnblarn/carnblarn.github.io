no regret  but disappointing rita  makes me feel like the scum of the earth  im sorry   i know   i just had a  bad day and  let it get to me i guess   first it was smashing that light  which was weird

that   arthur left his family too late  the damage was already done  you can still save your family   by leaving them   youll always need someone on your table  if you stay  sooner or later youll be caught  and theyll pay a terrible price for what youve done  because long after youre executed  theyll still have to go through life  with your name branded across their foreheads   dex  i have something to tell you  and maybe i shouldnt i dont know   okay   i found another ci dad was sleeping with  a woman named laura moser   harry was right this is it   does that name mean anything to you

and support  and  youve been the one constant  the one constantly good thing in my life   ive been good for her  and rita says im good for her and the kids  no one would ever say that about arthur  maybe harrys wrong  maybe things could turn out differently for me   morgan  debra morgan  need you inside  ill be right there   i love you   im so thankful  the mustang  arthur brought it in two days
