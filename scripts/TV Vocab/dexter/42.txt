shooting  i thought you said you didnt see anything  i was in shock  my memory was fuzzy  now its clear  theres no doubt in my mind that nikki shot me and frank  mine either  are you talking about going on the record  and what happens later if you decide youre still confused  i wont  you sure  because if this comes back to bite you in the ass youre screwed  my dad used to say a good cop does whatever it takes to close a case  other cops not you  just think about it okay  id hate to have you make a decision when your heads not on straight  theyre on a wild goose chase  no way theyll find a match to trinitys dna  hes too wellhidden  i could be helping  finding the hammer he used  or i could help someone in need  me  preliminary spatter report on the bludgeoning  we land on the specific hammer for the murder weapon  narrowing it down ill keep you posted  im actually heading out now to do some field research  well how about you vince you got anything for me on that dna  no matches in

they gonna go visit him in prison  cause this is going to get him caught  maybe he wants to get caught or hes sending a message  or hes trying to leave some kind of a legacy  hey   how come youre not working this case  im busy  got a report to finish  his family keeps him safe but these ashes leave him exposed  maybe this is how i get to the truth  the murder weapon  hes using it out in the open

eyes  the night that you got shot  i was in a hotel room with johnny  bullshit we did meth  we watched porn we fucked  i mean we were watching cartoons all night  what do you want what do you want you fucking liar  no matter how many times you ask me its not going to change  i didnt shoot you okay i didnt kill that old man  ow fuck jesus christ  im gonna say i saw you  people get mugged every day  maybe somebody else wanted you dead  huh like who like who  oh fuck youre a fucking cop for christs sakes  you piss people off for a living  fuck you fuck you  fucking hurting me    you think that

we all yeah  i could use a change of scenery  im thinking   press liaison  well pr could certainly use your political skills  and sergeant batista could stay in homicide  well let me think about it  we both know youre not easily replaced  that didnt seem to be a problem before  ill let you know what i decide  hello  tell me thats the last one of it the last bag from your apartment  its not from my apartment but rita wait wait  surprise for you for all of you  no way a nintendo ds  i know its not an ipod  a mini dvd player this is awesome  for harrison  and for my lovely wife  a bread maker  were always running out of bread  were always running out of milk did you get me a cow too   thank you so much  this is so awesome   thank you dexter  youre welcome  whats the matter you dont like your gift  i appreciate you trying  i really do  but we dont need gifts  we need you  need me to do what  just talk to me  im uh  people just do this  say what theyre thinking  out loud   how hard can it be  im trying im trying  you know what you can try harder in therapy  im moving up our next session  wow  whats the occasion  i have good news  you want to guess  um  youre naked under there  and i get to see guess what else you get to do  okay now im really having impure thoughts  you get to stay in homicide  really  wow how did you  i had a little talk with the deputy chief  and i told him homicide couldnt afford to lose you  and neither could i  you  are  amazing  so hes okay with both of us staying  well we can talk about logistics   later right  you told him youd leave instead  angel  it just makes more sense  youre full of it  youre sweet  and youre beautiful but youre full of it and i cant let you do that  well  im not gonna let you leave homicide  you love it  and if you leave you wont be you  at least not the you that i want to be with  what do we do  i dont know  how are we supposed to decide how are we supposed to decide  our jobs or each other  shit  shit is right  this is arthur mitchell  at his core  is there something in his dna that lets him keep a family  ome magic gene im missing  looking for something  youre surfing on my turf blood guy  just curious  then youll be interested to know that the mitochondrial dna  female  so mother daughter sister  could even be his granny he smudged on that wall  probably whacks off with her ashes  why would he do that  why wouldnt he  because shes important to him  dude joke  his history with her shapes who he is  like how my mother breastfed me till i was six  and now no one will ever match up  lieutenant  its a grant 24ounce steel framing hammer   sorry  its the murder weapon in the bludgeoning case  i did some independent research   updated my report  right right   thanks  actually im done   with my work for the day  if its okay with you i have some  personal stuff to take care of  take care of the personal stuff dexter  take very  good care  sure as hell trying to  you know those things never go bad  well yeah tell me about it ive had these since i was a rookie  so  i never heard back from you about being an eyewitness  that mean you changed your mind  yeah  just cause nikkis a piece of shit and my dad was a lying sack  doesnt mean i have to be  thanks for talking some sense into me  just looking out for my partner  whats all this  im thinking maybe nikki wald was telling the truth  since when  since i talked to her myself  wait you what  ive been going over everything you   collected from lundys hotel and  all his personal effects  heres the thing  some of its missing  no way it was all logged in by me  lundy had research books on that serial killer he was hunting  and audio tapes  i saw them in his room  you still wrapped up in that deb  i dont mean to speak ill  but the guy was chasing a ghost  i think that ghost stole his books  you got to stop  youre making yourself crazy  im telling you someone took lundys stuff  and im telling you  you got to let this go  look im sure youre tired   why dont you go home  and what  paint my fucking nails  im kind of sick of hearing it quinn  then i guess i wont say it anymore  i am no longer seeing lieutenant laguerta  i mean i see her    every day  but  we broke up   officially  and permantltly  are you sure  because frankly im getting a little sick of the back and forth  i apologize for the inconvenience  well its middle school bullshit lieutenant  i really dont want to have this conversation again  you wont have to  weve both signed affidavits to make it official  our relationship didnt interfere with any ongoing investigations  and the department will not be held liable for any fallout  well thats something at least  for the record neither one of us was sexually harassed  yeah  all advances were very welcomed  and there was not nor will there be  a hostile work environment  so its done  were both staying in homicide  let me be clear  the paperwork youre filing is serious  if i find out this is bullshit there will be consequences  severe   careerending consequences  dont angel  its over  right    sorry  i should get back to work  this is the last of it my dark passengers stuff   and the reason i cant let go of my apartment  if i dont figure out how to hide this  im gonna lose my family  trinity has the answer hes kept his family close  even after death  who did you lose arthur    vera mitchell  sister of arthur mitchell  found dead in a  bathtub  marsha mitchell    jumped to her death off the collins canal bridge  henry mitchell    died in an alley of a fatal head wound  sister mother father  hes recreating their deaths  decade after decade  cycles of three  i watched my mother get sawed into pieces  now i cut people up  we both have skeletons  which means we both get a closet to keep them in  arthur has a closet  i know almost everything about you arthur  except where you hide  ready or not here i come  oh my goodness kyle you all right  yeah cut myself at the build  i didnt think it was a big deal but it wont stop bleeding  here  right out in the open  there must be more hes hiding inside  come on in we got a first aid kit in the house  sorry  no boots in the house  here ill get the kit  you make yourself at home  thanks i will  tacky but normal  his secrets must be under lock and key  not the dirty laundry im looking for  shit  arthur has a place to put his lamp  the dates and locations from lundys books  arthurs been using four walls builds around the country as a cover to kill  and these are his trophies  and these are his trophies  hanging right up here on the wall just like his hammer in the garage  his blood slides  he doesnt need a secret apartment hes hiding in plain sight  right in the center of his family  im the one whos lurking in the shadows  and here she is arthurs own dark passenger  his sister vera  the tank is low but then shes been on the road for 30 years  kyle  hiding in plain sight is one thing but this is your weak spot  what happens when its exposed  come out come out whoever you are  okay  lets have a look at that hand  dont   touch  my sister  im sorry i didnt know  i cant breathe  im sorry  forgive me   im so sorry  jesus arthur what the hell was that  its just  my sister  she died when i was young  it was very painful for me  i understand  ive lost people too  yeah have a seat  if the ashes bother you so much  why do you keep them out  because shes a part of me kyle  helped make me who i am  but if your family ever saw you   so upset  theyd understand  this is my home  i can be myself here  you make it sound easy  i used   to push people away because of my past  even los a a relationship over it  like you   but you changed  yeah i met sally had my kids  and i realized the only way  it was   gonna work is if i jumped in with both feet  jump in with both feet  and that  saved your family  kyle   my family saved me  wait  i want to give you something  for the next build  i thought you should have your own tools  its the least i can do  thanks  for giving me your murder weapon  see you at the next build then  wouldnt miss it  i want to be a part of this family  and i know i need to jump in with both feet  im glad but  i want to let you in  honestly i dont know  how  i never learned  no of course you didnt  god i  i mean with your mother and   what about his mother  she was murdered    right in front of him  wow thats  thats quite a history  and it shaped who i am  but  i want to change  let me ask you a question dexter  and id like you to be honest  ill try  would you say that youre afraid to let rita get close to you   yes  why  because of my past  are you afraid shell abandon you  yes  but rita is not your mother  no definitely not but if she  ever sees  me for who i really am  then what  you think i would leave  yes absolutely  well then youve got something to learn about me  i married you because i want to get to know the real you  thats what ive been trying to tell you  dexter  tell rita the truth  why did you keep your apartment  because  i need   space  to keep  my stuff  we have a house theres plenty of room  i think what dexter is trying to say  is that he needs space for himself   in the marriage  okay  yeah but  i really do need a place  to put my stuff  of course  of course ill   ill give you space  you will  yes  see what happens when youre honest  you get what you need  i know youre here  you always catch me  mind if i join you  look how beautiful you are  ill never get tired of hearing that  you look better  i feel better  you know why  nikki wald didnt kill lundy   how do you know  cause somebody stole lundys trinity research   me  and theres only one person whod have a reason to do that  me  trinity   youre kidding  he must have realized lundy was getting close  think about it that newspaper article  maybe he even saw lundy staking out that office building   i guess  he killed lundy   he shot me he stole lundys books to cover his ass  not exactly but you were on a roll there for a while  do you know how awesome this is  it means that cocksucker is still out there and now i dont have  to sit around and wait for someone else to take care of it  i can get him  great now i have got to worry about you getting on trinitys radar  have you told laguerta your theory  not yet  i need to make sure i have a case first i dont want to step on my dick  no definitely not  i got to get to the station  lots of work to do  by the way  i think i know who dad was fucking  what  wait who  ill tell you when i know more i dont want to step on my dick with that either  so you ready  i was born of primordial ooze  i crawled out of my own mothers blood  i hid among the humans hoping not to be seen  but somewhere along the way i grew legs  stood upright  would you give me a hand  absolutely  so what do you think is it too stuffy  nope  its perfect  thank you  i became a husband  a father  i had to evolve it was the only way to survive  i have something else i want to give you  being myself in front of my family will take some getting used to  but arthur was right  it does feel  good  got it  a padlock  for the door to keep it locked  shouldnt i leave it open  please we have three young children  theres dangerous stuff in there
