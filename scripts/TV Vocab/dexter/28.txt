connection  i think i just upset him more  its okay it led to a really good talk  talk  i didnt tell himdexter  i keep my promises  but when and if you ever feel comfortable telling him  im just

part of me really cares  its just that  i destroyed my marriage  i lost my little girl  im a divorced cop halfway down the road to a fullblown cliche  a divorcedalcoholic cop  and i needed to fight that  loneliness  so i found affection any way i could  i meanhookers  i needed to connect with someoneanyone  who wouldnt hurt me back no more  thats it not special  just true  i hate anyone who disgraces the badge  i hate liars worse  im not lying  i know  are we good  you keep your dick in your pants unless yourea playing with yourself  orb you are doing something consensual and legal  then

concernramon  but not a priorityright  lower your voice  is there a problem here  yeahsergeantyour people dont know what the fuck theyre doing  heythat credit you get for being a copit has a limit  so you do have a game plan  cause it doesnt seem to involve listening to solid leads  every lead has been followed  then why am i getting calls from a guy who says he saw freebo in miami  ill tell you whybecause you ignored him he called you four times   never happened  okay  ramonyou give me this tipsters namei will personally follow through  the motherfucker was anonymousmaria  ohdid i forget to leave my name sorry  but he knew things about this case  like freebo had a girlfriendteegan  a lot of people know thatsir  i passed her photo all over town  maybe the tipster wanted reward money  you can find excusesor you can get off your asses and try finding my brothers killer  okayramonyou need to leave now  just do your fucking job  you wanna give his brother the headsup  you do it  im a little tired of the prado family right now  that was easier than i thought  miguel wont be happy to hear ramons throwing tantrums with fellow law enforcement  not that ill rely on that alone  the stakes are too high  and im on a roll  maybe i should call rita with an anonymous tip to marry me   ohwhat the fuckdex  goodyoure here put this on  i dont need a giant condom i need your spatter report on jack rice  im working on it  just put on the suit and the gloves and the maskplease  fine  the sooner im done with the weeping fianceethe better off ill be  raw emotion not your fortehuh  what the hell is that supposed to mean  heyits not mine either  its easy as hell for quinn  think hes just nicer than me  i dont know about nicer  although studies show that emotional intelligence plays a greater role in individual success  than anything that can be measured on a standard iqtest  come here  stand right here and bash this for mewill ya  are you calling me an emotional idiot  if youre an idiotim a vegetable  wellthats for fucking sure  fuckinadex  sorry  you know whatfiona has her facts wrong  she described the assailant as sixfoot  but calculating jack rices heightallowing for the upward angle  layman here  wellyour body acts as a shield  and all of this is what your body doesnt block  so the killer stuns the victim with the first blow  he falls to his knees  the second blow brings us blood  if the killer was sixfootthe spatter shadow at the crime scene would be taller and wider  insteadits an exact match for your shadow  ergorices killer was approximately your height and weight  you mean fucking weepbag fionas height and weight  noi mean  i missed that interesting  you and jack planning a big wedding  yeah jack had a lot of friendsyeah  you knowthe thing isi went through his address book  and i called a lot of people  and none of them have ever heard of you  wellwe like to keep to ourselvesyou know  when was that taken  it was right after we met  did he get a chance to see it before you killed him  what  uhwhwhat is she talking about i dont  its photoshoppedfiona  its really good workthough really good did you do it yourself  godno  seeim thinking maybe you broke into his apartment to leave that as a surprise  he comes hometries to throw your ass outand you kill him  noi would never hurt jack   we were getting married  you heard about the breakin on tv  then you create the same sketch that they show on tvthe same crowbar in the back door  you bash your own fucking knee in  did he ever even talk to youfiona  did he ever even say more than one fucking coffee to go  thats it this is over  im sorry  wait outsideofficer  ill take it from here  its all right  i know how it really was between you and jack  i know you all right   yeah  its safe its just me and you  can you believe this shit  its amazing shes so convincing  im talking about him  im gonna kick his cadillacdriving ass  before jackmy life was an unanswered question
