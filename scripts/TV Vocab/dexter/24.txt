to face him   and i have dishes to do  ok ill let you know when its over  its doakes you hate the guy  i used to i cant even afford to think of him as a person anymore  would you get going  i tried  if they find doakes locked inside a cage  itll seriously undermine my frame job  i need to beat them to that cabin  waiting in the everglades are hordes  of county sheriffs search parties and ravenous reptiles  and at this corner wearing dark trunks the mighty dexter  drive much  i need a miracle  theres a switch right behind you on the wall  damn its good to see another face  i never thought i would  im sergeant james doakes  miami metro homicide   who put you in there  a fucking psycho  he could be back any minute  grab that key right behind you on the wall  who is he  his name is dexter morgan  i need you to open this gate  why would he put you in there  because i find out hes the bay harbord butcher  please just open this fucking gate  hes the butcher  thats im trying to tell you  whats in there  exactly what you think it is  its evidence  and i saw what happened  i really need to get out of this cage lady  poor thing all alone  im okay just open the gate  not you  hiding such an enormous secret  what a burden thats got to be no wonder he is so shut down  what are you his accomplice  im his soulmate  you cant leave me in here like this youll be an accessory  im not gonna leave you  not like that  what the fuck are you doing  what the fuck are you doing  no do you understand this is murder  open this sucking door this is a fucking murder  hey dexter morgan miami metro pd forensics  im here to join the search for the bay harbor butcher  the search is on hold right now until they sort out the confusion   confusion huh  yeah its a real mess  take right at the fork park outside the line of fire trucks  confusion requires fire trucks  when something beyond reason happens it turns skeptics into believers  believers in a higher power  but what kind of power did this  you were fucking fast i just got here   and took a helicopter with lundy  i broke a lot of speed limits  after you left i realized you were right  i didnt want to miss the action  what happened  they think a propane tank exploded  how  do i look like a fucking fire chief  did they find a body  just bits and pieces so far  was it spontaneous combustion  divine intervention  if you believe that god makes miracle  you have to wonder if satan has a few up his sleeve  but when you dont believe in anything who do you thank at a time like this  we got a floater  he got left off  separation  gaping areas of  putrefied tissue  extensive fourth degree burns  big ass fucking explosion  what else can you give us  these linear lines around his eyes are unburned  he was squinting  alive when it happened  what else  teeth are intact dental records should give us a positive id  goddammit masuka is it doakes  male  africanamerican about the right length of torso  heavily muscled  i think its him  these are the same kind of tools that scuba diving class found  hed need them to make cuts that clean  those come from the suspect  no they belong to a second body  and whoever he was he was dead and dismembered before the explosion  this is where the butcher did his dirty work  its a perfect location for a kill room   doesnt get anymore remote than this  no it couldnt   this is good news gentlemen  and lady  right all right we keep the search on  until we get a firm id on that body in the water  you agree  the evidence is compelling  overwhelming actually  i guess we got our man  shit laguertas here   i woudnt if i were you  is it james  they dont know yet  apparently miracles are subjective  i cant exactly feel laguertas pain but i can appreciate it  doakes wasnt so bad in the end  but the truly tragic thing would be to let his sacrifice go to waste  theres only one way i can think of to honor him  i have to embrace my freedom  sleep  what a concept  i cant believe i actually contemplated turning myself in  this is so much better than a prison cell  i can squeeze fresh orange juice  savour a fine french roast  grab a morning work out  ok working out i could have done in prison but still  im free  sorry   hope i didnt scare you  what are you doing out there  i figured the kids were still sleeping i didnt want to ring the bell  why are you here  i figured the kids were still asleep  i like when you sneak unexpected  yeah i wound up with some unexpected time on my hands  like twenty years to life  i dont know if this is a good idea  i was just getting used to you from a distance  i dont know youve been like a mirage  ive been right here  youre the one that run away  yeah i did  i kinda forgot who i was  i got it straight now  keep it straight  or i wont be here next time  i know that  mom  its the sex police   how come youre still in bed  i overslept  will you make us pancakes please  whats under here  are you guys back together  i guess we are  over  under over  under   maybe i should do it myself  no i wanna do it   were gonna be late  so what case is closing  we still need confirmation on doakess body  and if its him   then its over  the case not us right  we still have the wrapup to do cataloguing confirming   filing more filing  so weve got time  plenty   time enough for a vacation  now youre talking  toes in the sand tequila  little tiny bikini  how about a parka   a what  ive had my feel of heat  no more heat youd look great in a parka  ever heard of lake ipperwash   cant say that i have  wonderful ice fishing very romantic  fine ok  lets just go   morning dex  donut  im not really feeling like donuts today know what i mean  oh right  donuts   hey are you free  vince you have no idea  good i got a dozen boxes of burned up shit from the cabin  that need cataloguing  i was looking more closely at the date of james special forces missions   and  we have a positive id on the body  there may be an additional date which puts him out of the country  the burned victim is sgt doakes  dental records confirmed it  and the other body  jose garza a murder fugitive whos been living under the alias chris harlow  the body was dismembered  consistant with our other victims  deputy director adams is closing the case  i see  all the evidence points to james doakes as the bay harbor butcher  conclusively   i wanted you to hear it from me 1st  thank you  i am truly sorry  dont know why they keep hauling crap from the cabin in here  we already know what we need to know   doakes was a suicidal maniac  the term is homicidal maniac  not that im judging  whatever he blew himself up thats what im saying  i heard somebody saying it was a propane accident  right  doakes accidentally turned on the propane valve  and then the stove  the stove was on  it was in the official fire investigators report this morning  i mean  i guess it could be that doakes didnt realize fire and gas are a bad combo  but my moneys on suicide  a bad ass like doakes would rather burn than get burned  its a good line for my movie   i better write it down  youre writing a movie about doakes  maybe or not  hed rather burn than get burned  i checked and didnt see any gps device in the minivan dexter  did you check the glove box its grey rectangular  the size of a paperback book  it wasnt there  i even looked under the seats you think it was stolen  maybe  thanks rita ill see you tonight  if someone stole my gps it wouldve lead em straight to doakes  who do i know with a nasty habit of stealing  my miracle worker  it looks peaceful in there  doesnt it  im glad you called  i was afraid maybe youd left town   seems i found a good reason to stay  like what  a new victim  you mean you  thats why you asked me to the aquarium  a public place you thought i was gonna  that i would slit my needle into your neck  is that how you do it  its one of the ways  youre afraid of me now arent you  always been afraid of you dexter  why  from the 1st time i saw you i could see how hopelessly consumed  you were by your need  you lied to me  all that time as my sponsor  you said all you wanted was to help me control my addiction   would you control it  thats not what you really wanted  was it  what do you think i wanted  to know what its like  to feel something  that deeply  anything thats why you hang up in recovery groups  youre emotionally colorblind  you use the right words you pantomime the right behavior  but feelings never come to pass   its not true  it is lila  you know the dictionary definition of emotions  longing joy sorrow  you have no idea of what any of those things actually feel like  youre wrong i have feelings for you  you wanna have feelings for me   theyre just impulses  enough  theyre primitive responses to immediat needs  you know all the words but you cant hear the music  dont do this here  im just like you  i was down to my last hope  so was i  when he told me who you are  i thought that was a secret worth protecting  most stuff in my mind  i wish you could have seen it  the explosion was  brilliant  im more like my father than ive ever imagined  i created a monster of my own  told you  were meant to be together  lila im sorry i pushed you away  i know how frightening it must have been for you  me scratching to get in  but its okay  im in now  and im not going anywhere  i am  and with doakes gone im starting to think its too dangerous for me here  i need to move on to disappear   ive already said my goodbyes  let me come with you  i was hoping youd say that  how long would it take you to get ready  to close my accounts  shut up my business  tomorrow afternoon  go home and pack ill call you tomorrow  i cant wait to go away with you  i cant wait  youre going away with me all right  in a garbage bag  but it went all right  sure for an internal affairs investigation  i spent 2 hours saying no  i did not rape lila tournay  shes bad shit nuts wacko i started to run out of adjectives  ive got a few you can use  the good news is the department is dying to drop the charge  theyre dodging enough bullets with this whole doakes thing  good  when they find out your socalled victim fled miami youll be reinstated   lila went away  she fucking better  last night i told her to haul her ass out of town before shes deported   you did that for me  of course for you and for dex  you 2 window lickers needed somebody to snap you out of it  its good to know somebodys pulling for you when youre down  okay i get the point   are you sure lila got the message  yeah totally  i made it pretty clear  excuse me donations can be made directly to me   donations  for sergeant doakes memorial service  you got to be kidding  thats what we do for a fellow officer   thanks again morgan  yeah  excuse me lieutenant i   was wondering  checks payable to cash  actually i wanted to offer my support  some sympathy or  whatever if you wanna talk  thank you morgan i can manage  im not so sure  youre collecting money to honor a killer  im not honoring the butcher im honoring james doakes  respectfully maria thats denial   so it is  youre choosing to be in denial  conscious denial  but the case is closed i wont pursue it  but i knew james  i knew him  as a partner and as a friend  and i have to keep on believing that is who he was because  if he could hide all that over fucked up shit   then i dont think i could ever  trust anyone again  thats right  or yourself  ill leave a check in your office  its strange to have a creation out there  a deeply mutated version of yourself  running loose and screwing everything up  i wonder if this is how parents feel  what the fuck   whatre you doing here  i came to make sure lila left town  me too  and if she was still here youre gonna what

name  but claims to have vital information on the butcher   any idea who she might be  english accent   thats her  i think  she might have a personal issue with me  its the same woman that tried to railroad batista avoid her  not a chance  now this case is closing i cant afford any loose ends   she said she was coming in  within the hour   and she mentionned my name  specifically  stick around well sort this thing out together  if lila plans to turn me in  why drop my name to the captain and give me a chance to intercept her  it doesnt make sense  unless she wants me here so she can hurt me

smarten up ok  i passed through the flames and rose from the ashes  again  ive never put much weight onto the idea of a higher power  but if i didnt know better id have to believe  that some force out there wants me to keep doing what im doing  you wanted to be close to me this is the most i have to offer  i cannot feel my  my legs and my body  good i chose a spinal epidural instead of a tranquilizer  ive got a plane to catch and you dont need to feel this  you killed an innocent man  i did it for you  you tried to kill the kids for me too  dont do this  you told me to accept what i am  and to trust in the one thing i know with absolute clarity  thank you  not long ago i had a dream that people could see me for what i am  for a brief instant in time the world actually saw my bodies of work  some even cheered  but as it turns out nobody mourns the wicked  sorry james  i think harry knew that from the start thats why he gave me a code  it cost him his life but it kept me alive through incredible trials  the code is mine now and mine alone  so too are the relationships i cultivate  theyre not just disguises anymore  i need them  even if they make me vulnerable  my father might not approve but im no longer his disciple  im a master now  an idea transcended into life  and so this is my new path  which is a lot like the old one  only mine  to stay on that path i need to work harder  explore new rituals evolve  am i evil  am i good  im done asking those questions  i dont have the answers  does anyone  resync by pano
