than shes letting on   suspicious but it doesnt prove a thing   hows this for outside the box  christines the same height as the shooter   you out of your fuckin mind  no way christine had anything to do  with shooting you or lundy   youve been dating her for what two months  how well do you even fuckin know her   the dna results on christine hill are back   shes fucking related to trinity   i went back and i looked through all the postcards  you sent me over the years  every trip you took in every city you went  a woman died in a bathtub   i dont know what youre talking about   its all right  i protected you  that fbi agent lundy i shot him   you what   no   im gonna ask you again  how are you related to the trinity killer   and im gonna tell you again  i dont know   your dna matches his   i dont know anything about that   which raises one huge question  who are you   who are any of us really  we all have our public life  our private life   and your secret life  the one that defines you   your mother  is listed as lorraine hill  where is she   dead  five years now   your father seems to be  unknown  why is that   i told you  my mother got pregnant  it happens  i never met my father   i think youre lying   so do i  i think christine has her own secret life  shes got to be arthurs daughter   because of your relationship with our department  weve been treating you  with the greatest of civility  please  dont let that hide the fact  that you could be in real trouble here  give us a name   if she says the name arthur mitchell then   nationwide manhunt  hes lost to you forever   give

thanks   shit  ive got work to do  beaudry   breaker 19  this is little chopper  heading north on the 95 big road  just north of miami  looking for the 1020  on one stan the man beaudry  driving a black peter car out of jtown   uh copy little chopper  just saw him pulling into freddys truck stop  off the 91 exit   thank you driver  arthur   im standing in front of your house kyle   what   i called the four walls office  for your home address  seems to be johnnys jet skis   theyre fun you should try one   what this tells me is youve been lying to me  from the very beginning   well in the big scheme of things  being a liar isnt nearly as bad as being a pedophile   do not call me that   i want my 50000  why should i trust you to be silent  after ive given you the money   heres what you can trust  if you dont meet me with the money  ill call your family your school  and then the police   give me until tomorrow   how do i know i can trust you   i guess thats just the world we live in kyle      you dont let me out of here  im gonna kick your fuckin ass  aah you fuck  what the fuck are you doing   normally wed have a little chat  id show you the error of your ways  but im kind of in a hurry here   oh i am gonna fuck you up   uhhuh   im gonna rip your heart out   yeah i heard   im gonna gut you like a fuckin pig  youll be sorry that you ever crossed me  aah   i just need to make sure  the police find arthurs dna  when they see this picture of christine  theyll think shes beaudrys daughter  lundys trinity books   thanks  only be a minute  mines dead  dont have a land line   hello   daddy  its me  im sorry i havent returned your calls  ive been   i know where youve been  dont call me anymore you understand   ddaddy i just   its slightly unbelievable that beaudry  would even own a toothbrush  but im gonna go for it  and now the final piece of the puzzle  i think im done  stan beaudry is now the trinity killer  love thy neighbor  bullshit  i should leave it alone  go inside  watch the history channel  hey elliot   dex   stay the hell away from my wife   jesus dex  aah wow okay  uh i guess i deserved that  now now wait  i know im an asshole  but just wait a minute  i got caught up in a moment  ritas amazing   you think i dont know that   and im an idiot  and if i were you  i would want to kill me too   dont ever touch her again   your hand   yousaw   i saw  youre not mad   no  im not mad   what are you   glad  that you cared that much  cant believe you hit him though   i know  i didnt see that coming   i didnt either   professional courtesy dictates  we give you a heads up   mmhmm were married   as in man and wife   well i dont see how that changes the facts of the matter   its certainly gonna change the context of your accusation   do you really want to go in front of the board of review  and attack the sacrament of holy matrimony   the issue here is perjury   alleging an affair is one thing  but now youd be going after us  for embracing the bedrock of family values   in heavily catholic  and heavily latino miami   youll come across as a soulless  antifamily schmuck   but if thats what you want to do  well take the fight   its also worth noting  that the chief of police  met his now wife  on the job as well   you can lecture him  on how he is in violation  of department protocol   i can only marvel at the level of cynicism  using the institution of marriage  as a cheap political ploy  you must be very proud of yourselves  for being so clever   you didnt give us a lot of options   i hope that your life together  will not be as empty and as amoral  as your decision to get married was   we did the right thing   of course we did   batista  okay  we just got a lead on the trinity killer   according to this  he had a delivery two days ago in jacksonville  and due back here last night   yeah well im guessing christine  found a way to warn him off   well hello mr toothbrush   dont forget mr comb   oh yeah  weve got some dna going on in here   great   dex  that guy that was bludgeoned  you remember the kind of hammer   uh it was a grant   24ounce framing hammer   we got him   its a little hard to believe this is the same guy  that never made a mistake in 30 years   ah im sure he made mistakes  we just werent looking   a truck stop employee  noticed stan beaudrys truck during the night  preliminary investigations
