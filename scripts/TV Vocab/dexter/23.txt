worth the risk  to your job to your career  when you care about someone you do what you have to do  your credibility was compromised when you failed to report a call  from the subject of a goddamn fbi manhunt  what really pisses me off is you might be right  the kids have been through so much lately  i dont want them to feel like theyve been abandoned by everyone they love  does this mean were dating again  i track killers thats what i do they tend to move around  i know that  then im not sure what you thought would happen when the case ended  i like it rough  jesus  i dont need doakes dead i just need his fingerprints  to complete my frame job  every saturday beginning dive classes  practice underwater skills beside this dock  tomorrow theyll find a morbid little surprise  i wanna know if theres anything unusual about my fathers death  he killed himself  the idea of a code was one thing  but the reality of it  harry walked in on what he created  and he couldnt live with himself  i always thought hardening arteries squeezed the life out of my father  but it was me  harry gazed into the eyes of his creation and saw evil  pure and simple  my evil  it killed him  that shit about your father  if you wanna talk about it  about what  that my life is one tragic mistake  weve all felt that at one time or another i have  did you happen to be stuffing a human leg into a garbage bag at that point  if you wanna make a change nows the time  all you got to do is let me out of here  its over man  it is over when i say it is  theres that anger again you got to let that out man  careful sergeant you might get your wish  im flying without a code here  i can unleash the beast anytime   you know thats not the answer  but it would feel fucking great  but you would hate yourself for the rest of your life  all the things harry taught me  everything  its bullshit  its the only way i know how to live  turn yourself in  rule number one  dont get caught  youre spinning let me help you  sooner or later youll hurt someone else  im talking about your sister  or your girlfriend or even those kids   i would never  no not on purpose  but you cant control the shit thats growing inside of you its like cancer  and in case you havent noticed its spreading  end it now  take responsibility for who you are man  well go to the station together ill help you  morgan dont answer that  stay with me man  fuck  yes this is dexter morgan  my name is dr hill  i work at good samaritan hospital im calling on behalf of lila tournay   how did you get this number  youre on her emergency contact

discuss it over the phone you really need to be here   where are you going  dont worry  ill send the fbi your way soon enough   youre still gonna try to frame me  im kind of down a path here  youll get your chance to tell them im the killer  and theyll ignore you like before and ill   and youll burn in hell  something like that  hes gone dex  dads heart finally gave out  harrys heart gave out when he saw whats inside me  he thought he could tame it give it a purpose  help it find a place in the natural order  guess he was wrong  i need a second alone with him okay thanks  we spoke on the phone regarding your girlfriend ms tournay  shes not my girlfriend  i thought she said she was   she probably did  so youre  its complicated look why is angel here  we found rohypnol the daterape drug  in lilas system  with her bruising the wound to the back of her head  we may be looking at a case of sexual assault  no that didnt happen  ms tournay has no recollection of what did happen  shes requested we perform a rape kit  i need to talk to her  you came to see me youre so sweet  the doctors think angel raped you   did he everythings a bit fuzzy  this is desperate   it wont work  what are you talking about  im just glad youre here  i missed you so much  this is how you win me back  framing a good man to get what you want  which is precisely what im doing to doakes  whats the matter dexter  you look so sad  lost  dont do this  i wont press charges against angel  ill do whatever you want  if you promise to take me back  why cant you just let me go  because im your real soul mate  not rita  me  i see you  inside  and im the only one  look where its gotten you  you know that i could never do anything like that right  you dont even have to say anything  you warned me about her but my dick wouldnt listen  i could lose everything over this  what would i say to my little girl  the doctor said lila has 72 h to press charges  maybe shell come to her senses  i should get home and grab a few hours of sleep let me get this  no back off i got it  if i got to choose a person a real person  to be like  out of anyone itd be you  im not really sure what that means but thanks dex  see you in the morning  id appreciate it if you didnt mention this to anyone at the station  of course not  thanks  how did it come to this ive always gone after criminals  now i have the fate of two cops in my hands  doakes was right the cancer is spreading   were out of yogurt  add it to the list   well stop by the store tonight  the stores on the way to work  its also on the way home were gonna be late  who joined who in the shower this morning  how about in the futur i set the alarm 10 min earlier  make it 20  the future im liking the sound of that  were being ordered to work  youre the head of the task force you do the ordering  whos d d adams  my boss  mission accomplished  the weapons i tossed into the ocean were found as planned  one more nail in doakes coffin  all right people listen up  this is fbi deputy director max adams he just got in from washington  hes going to be helping us out for a while  once again i have pledged  our full cooperation and resources  so lets make him feel at home  the murder weapons before you were found yesterday  by a beginning scubadiving class  the instructor contacted the fbi directly  which brought them to my attention  fingerprint analysis ties them to one james doakes   this doesnt prove a damn thing  not now   why wasnt i brought in on this  you just were frank   now we know sergeant doakes  lundy better watch his back  hes abandoned the tools of the trade that means hes probably on the run  this footage was taken four days ago at a mobile station  just off highway 41 southeast of naples  ladies and gentlemen sergeant james doakes  i cant believe it  349 for regular  so we  have let our target get away once  lets not drop the ball again  asshole  highway 41 runs through the everglades national park  it wont be long now i can hang this on doakes and then  then what  years of trials and appeals with him  pointing his finger and calling me killer  for such a neat monster im making an awfully big mess  where does this prick adams get off taking such cheap shots at lundy  i heard that doakes walked off  in the middle of lundys questioning and that lundy didnt stop him  i might have heard that wrong  peters  nice hair borelli im sure the johns up in boystown  are loving that duran duran look  what you meatheads lose your sense of humor  your joke wasnt funny  we have a warrant for detective batistas arrest  bullshit for what  a woman named lila tournay  has filed sexualassault charges against him  that fucking bitch  its okay i knew this was coming  its not okay captain lieutenant  put those away or i will shove them up your ass  whats going on here  weve been asked to bring batista upstairs for processing  im sure that detective batista will go along with you peacefully  its not your fault  ill be okay  it isnt my fault i warned angel  still i hate to see him disgraced in front of everyone  and laguerta about to lose her former partner her friend  even lundy is caught in hurricane dexters path of destruction  maybe this is how evil works  destroying everything it touches  including my father  youre not gonna believe the morning im having   i know the feeling  my car is stalled on harper and 3rd  think you can come get me   hang tight ill be right there  thanks dex  im the helpful handyman how evil can i possibly be  im sparing rita and deb by framing doakes  right  over here  thank god  ive been held prisoner in a cabin for 2 fucking days  fucking hellhole  i dont wanna go to the cabin  i need you to get my ass out of here  im a police sergeant miami metro homicide  i gotta run upstairs theres a whole batista thing going on   lunch today  doubtful  ive got to write up a status report for deputy director adams  whyd they send that dipshit  washington gets nervous when theres no movement on a case   especially one as big as this  no movement  youre the reason they found the blood slides in doakes car  im also the one who let him get away   we all let him get away  i was in charge  the evidence was there  but something inside me wasnt convinced he was our guy so  i let him walk  it was a bad call   now we might never  stop it   stop what  acting like me  youre a god dont you forget it  so what do you think it is  carburettor  transmission that round black hose thing  im more a boat guy  the last thing i need right now is a major repair bill  throw in a tow and rental

better idea  pack a lunch bring the kids ill take you out on the ocean tomorrow   the kids have school tomorrow  think of it as a field trip  you dont know codys teacher  just one day just one more

food  shit  all right  suck my dick motherfucker you understand  friends of yours  from what i can tell theyre friends of that drug dealer  they wouldve killed me once i had all that coke on the boat  thanks morgan  well this is awkward  i think we made some alligators very happy  so here we are  back to fucking square one  not exactly  ill tell you what james   can i call you james  knock yourself out  im toying with an idea  ive been under federal investigation for two months  my trophies were stolen  sorry  the code i live by has been shattered  and i have a coworker in a cage  things arent going so well  no shit i can see that  you told me  to take responsibility for what i am  you were right  harry killed the wrong person   morgan youre not thinking about  kill myself no thats pathetic  but i cant live in this house of cards anymore  waiting for it all to fall down  i need to do something you know  im thinking about turning myself in  thats a good call morgan thats a tough call  but thats a good call man  i need some fucking relief  yeah you cant keep running man  thats for pussies  youre just gonna end up in exactly the same situation   sooner or later  prison  i could finally get some sleep  yeah  in the long run it would be easier on deb  better than watching me dragged in like an animal  which lets face it will happen  someday  morgan well do it together  ill go with you  come on lets go  if i do this i need a day to get my affairs in order  fine tie me up throw me in the trunk lets go  i brought supplies fresh fruit  mention that when they interview you for the story of my life  dont leave me in this cage anything could happen whatre you doing  i think weve seen the worst of that  ive really enjoyed our conversations james  i lie to everyone i know  except my victims right before i kill them  its hard to establish much of a rapport there  sorry about the cage  fuck   what  its me what are you doing tonight  im about to get off of work why  ive got some papers i need you to sign  papers what kind of papers  ill explain when i see you  im meeting masuka and batista for drinks  why dont you bring the papers and join us   hows angel doing  how do you think hes doing  its your fault hes in this mess if you hadnt fucked elvira  im not the best brother am i  dexter are you smoking something  ive always been curious to try do you have any weed  okay now im really worried  theres no need to worry  ill bring by the papers tomorrow  its strange this should be difficult  but a sense of peace is settling over me  calm  maybe its the moonlight  tom  can i meet you outside  sure  ill check in back home  i need a personal day  i hope its a joke  just one day i think i can prove james is innocent  i talked to a couple of fbi agents   who were in haiti  jesus maria  were in the middle of a manhunt  youre down two detectives and now you want time off  no we cant spare you right now  this wasnt a request  i wont be here tomorrow i just wanted you to know that   diablo  what is this shit masuka   hey tequilas all the same  not when its made from pumpkins  were not in the same pay grade  if i lose my job over this bro   i wont have a pay grade  it wont happen   we all know youre innocent  how am i gonna prove it  i cant explain the roofies the rough sex   rough sex  it was her idea  now its my word against hers im screwed   you have got to fight back  dude morgans right  you got to man up get tough loves a battlefield  or in your case a restraining order  i appreciate you guys doing this but you dont have to stay  does it ever floor you guys  that we had a killer right under our noses this whole time  i mean who doesnt see that shit  that didnt come out right  its all right  that stuff doesnt bother me anymore  next rounds on me  i was wondering when youd show up  we need to talk  sounds good to me  im making coffee do you want one  im here to ask you respectfully to drop the charges against angel  if angel molested me as the evidence seems to indicate  then he should face the consequences dont you think  it doesnt matter what i think  but heres what i know  after tomorrow i wont be around anymore  so theres no end game in this for you  youre going somewhere  its looking more and more likely  where  all that matters is that ill be out of reach permanently  come on  tell me i have a right to know  youre the one who taught me to accept the things i cant change  this is one of those things  i dont understand how men can be so stupid  not all men  yes every single one of you  i mean how could dexter and batista be so easily duped by lila  i took one look at her i knew she was a walking nightmare  thats not stupidity its simply in our dna  when a pretty girl smiles and bats her eyelashes were unable to resist  im worried about batista  this is so fucked i wont let him take the fall for this  what can you do  i was wondering if you might access  those great big fbi files of yours  and do a search on miss lila tournay  you see powerless to resist  will adams be pissed off when he sees you used fbi files for this  i certainly hope so  she has no warrants  no criminal record  nothing with the dmv  and no social security number  what about visas or green cards or whatever  nothing no records  thats impossible everyone has a paper trail  everyone real  that sneaky bitch shes using an alias  that would be my guess  how do i find out lilas real name  i think you know the answer to that  cut off her head look for a label  theres probably an easier way  you got something smaller  the last time she was in my apartment she microwaved some popcorn  theres definitely gonna be prints on this  all right got it  next time make her a cup of tea  this is marlene from accounting  hi marlene from accounting  shes also a notary public   good for you  i met with a lawyer yesterday  he helped me prepare a living trust that gives you control of all my assets  in the event of my death or  certain other situations  god go away this is creepy  my financial planner said a guy my age should have a will   just a precaution  were all gonna die eventually  is this why you were acting so weird last night   probably  sign here  and ill need to see an id  fine  thanks for showing up last night to support batista  i am supporting him i stopped by lilas this morning  and  i talked to her i dont think shes gonna be a problem  yeah cause she certainly hasnt been one so far  im free tonight you wanna stop by well have beer  a couple of steaks i wanna talk to you about something  sounds good  so what am i getting i could use a new tv  okay but thats the one  lundy here  its lieutenant laguerta im calling you from haiti  lovely this time of year  i know im not your favorite person  in the station right now but i really need your help  how so  i just met with leones the travel agent that doakes saw  theres nothing new there i had two agents question him for hours  yet he never told them about the blood slides  what does he know about the blood slides  doakes was looking for a lab to have them analyzed   why  i dont know why  if hes our killer hed keep as trophies  he wouldnt have them analyzed  and i also have a list of specialops missions  that leones personally knows doakes took part in  two of them directly conflict with murders  we know to have been committed by the bay harbor butcher  im not sure leones is our most reliable witness  no but  its worth looking into isnt it  yes yes it is  for starters why dont you  brief me on both those missions  give me all the details  come on cody up and over  okay astor up and over there we go  watch your step   look a pelican  theres a bunch of them there  whats that  welcome to the gps 3000 teletracker  previous destinations  for so

the everglades  who remembers giving sergeant doakes directions 5 days ago  so you have a tip not doakes  the park manager said our target was headed into the everglades  we will have  the son of a bitch in handcuffs in 24 hours  id like to urge strong caution in apprehending the suspect  im looking into new intel that might come  i got your email about leones  he will say anything for a dollar  i agree we have to be careful about this  which is why id like some time  show a little guts for christs sakes  why dont you show a little respect  you wouldnt be closing in on a suspect if it wasnt for his work  you know as much as i enjoy hearing from the local talent  im really rather busy right now  i guess you dont need me to fight your battles anymore  maybe you need me to fight yours  arent you a tough one  im just warming up  i thought i lived in a shit can  officer morgan have you come to inquire about my welfare  i want you to leave miami tonight  dont ever come back  dont ever
