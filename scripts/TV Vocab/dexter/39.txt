rita what are you doing here   you lied to me dexter        the backyard barbecue  its a holdover from the last ice age when food was scarce  and men had to work together to take down such a large beast  those who worked well with others survived  and their genes have been passed down through the centuries  until they landed here  in this  my community       soda   whatever   how bout you   im good   ah wasted youth   hey can i talk to you for a second   yeah   i just got off the phone with dr montgomery  the doctor that took care of you after your accident   oh right   why didnt you tell

pressure   yeah i am   but you cant let things slip   im not slipping but somebody is        how come you never make the coffee even if youre up first   cause i dont want it bad enough to make it   i

suspect johnny rose  weve still come up with nothing  weve spoken to his mother his sister  his past two employers   everyone in his apartment building his mailman  the liquor store guy across the street   so no ones talking   we have his immediate family members under surveillance  but were still not getting any hits   well expand the search  draw up a new list of subjects  morgan where do we stand on the lisa bell murder   uh somewhere in the middle of shit creek   well you better find a paddle or im moving you  onto the vacation murder with the rest of us  finding johnny rose is our numberone priority   yes maam   dexter hey   uh hi   quick question do you like the dolphins   im really more of a manatee guy but sure   club level seats  enjoy  why   i cant go  and i asked myself  whos a friend that i could give em to  so i thought of you   miami dolphins football   club level  jeez who do i gotta fuck to get those kind of tickets   here  no fucking   dude   all right listen up  we got a report of a female body found at the old port  it looks like a jumper who wants it   sounds exciting sarge  but i think im gonna hold out for a cat stuck in a tree   huh i wonder if thats the woman lundy predicted   well take it  okay   unless she landed on a pile of marshmallows  theres gonna be blood  grab your kit   sure ill follow you there   ha ha not a chance concussionboy  rita said no driving for you youre coming with us        climb in the back dexter  youll be right on the subwoofer  you can feel the bass in your spine   loud      female caucasian mid30s im guessing   if this is the latest victim of lundys trinity killer  then hes a very different monster than i am   cause of death   gravity   why her why here  what is trinitys code  does he have one   no sign of a struggle no premortem bruising  no ligature marks   its looking like a suicide to me  oh well if it isnt special agent grandpa   shut up quinn  detectives  morgan  agent lundy   masuka   cool hat   you have a name yet   drivers license in her car says tarla grant  from fort lauderdale   so what brings you to our little suicide   just observing   youre a little quick to decide its a suicide  arent you   still has her jewelry money in her wallet  wasnt robbed   well why would she drive down from fort lauderdale  to jump off this abandoned warehouse   maybe she liked seagulls   well until we know one way or the other  id like to treat this as a homicide  if thats okay with you   all right  you two on the sixth floor  the rest of you search the grounds   victim tarla grant   so listen i want to apologize  for being such a douche the other night   no need  were all allowed to be the occasionaldouche   thanks  it was pretty embarrassing   debra if were being completely honest here  then yes i did come to miami to follow a case  but i have to admit  that im glad the killer chose this city  knowing id find you here   so is dexter right did you predict this jumper   what i did was suggest that if trinity held to his pattern  we could expect to see another woman die soon   is this her   little early to tell  but you might want to check your missing persons reports  i wouldnt be surprised to discover that shes married  with two kids   what else   im very curious to know if there was a similar death  at this site 30 years ago   i make my bodies disappear  trinity leaves his out in the open  supremely confident that no one will ever trace them to him  decade after decade  after decade       thanks for the ride   anytime partner      great security lights  just what every serial killer needs  what are you looking at   oh  dexter   did you get my message about the neighborhood watch meeting   actually no i didnt  all hey   this is my community i am one of you  uh great love having the neighbors over   are you ready to fight crime dexter   you betcha   thats good be aware of your neighbors  know their schedules  that way youll know if somethings different  if anything seems off   we dont want that   here have a whistle and a head flashlight  itll keep your hands free when youre out patrolling   patrolling were patrolling   your job is to watch and report watch and report   watch and report  you got it      community college for me now   hey dexter our neighborhood beautification association  asked me to give this to you im the secretary  its a warning against the graffiti on your gate  i know its silly but they want you to repaint   hey dex  i guess you saw the new motiondetector lights  i just put in   sure are bright   yeah brightest i could get  made sure i angled one right on your place too   thats very neighborly of you   we have to look out for each other   yeah this guy started off small a few broken windows  andys mailbox but yesterday he broke into  the walkers guest house and trashed the place  yeah next thing hell be stealing our women  cant let him steal our women now can we   no theyre our women      is that the signup sheet  yeah yeah  see were setting up patrols for every night of the week   im good for every night but wednesday  i got a poker night at the lodge   great   no one will come in or out of this neighborhood unnoticed   including me  its not the neighborhood vandal im worried about  its the neighborhood watch  hmm graffiti  excuse me   so i was all set to go to the university of miami next year  till my dad decided to get himself laid off   that blows   how about you jesse  you want to sign up for the neighborhood watch   sounds kind of lame   so lame   paint can soda can im thinking fingerprints  let me get that for you  and i know one little lady who is up past her bedtime   mom   dexter you cant treat her like a little girl anymore   i cant   hey dex   hey elliot   have a nice day   you knew this day would come dexter  youve always been good with kids  but eventually they grow up  they become more mature  develop complex emotions that just arent in your skill set  astors becoming a whole person and youre   something less   i hope youre not taking any of this seriously  the wife the kids the house in the burbs  its all great camouflage but thats all it is   its gotten more complicated than that   then uncomplicate it  you need to realize your limitations  remember exactly who you are  probably should have used something a little darker   its fine dad nothings gonna show through   i hope not dex for your sake   hey you ready to go   almost   ive got the best of bananarama   its a cruel summer  as long as the neighborhood vandal  keeps my neighbors on edge i will have no privacy  and im not going to let you do that to me jesse   tarla grant married mother of two   it fits   it fits what  lundys theory   that shes another victim of the serial killer   yes  what   his whole life is about serial killers  thats all he thinks about so of course he thinks  she was killed by a serial killer   i think hes a little smarter than that   im sure you do otherwise you wouldnt be  sitting at your desk going through 30yearold files  all afternoon   oh yeah guess what  so are you   just unsealed the juvey records of johnny rose  our vacation murder suspect   anything   shoplifting with his high school girlfriend nikki wald   that was like what ten years ago  you think theyre still in touch   since she testified against him back then  id say extremely unlikely   well at this point i think we need to take any shot we can   she lives in oakland park ill drive out there with you   lets go   that seem accidental and unplanned to you   even i believed it   i was thinking we could stop somewhere for lunch first   i know a little place where we can order some room service   okay here we go  female caucasian 36 mother of two  jumped to her death off the same warehouse  the womans family insisted she was the victim of foul play  but it was ruled a suicide   doesnt mean fuckall  someone fell or jumped off  the same warehouse eight years ago  someone else jumped off a ship loading crane  on the same pier back in 86  and another body washed up on the rocks  right in front of the warehouse only two years ago  nobody knows how it got there  this is miami deb people die   and sometimes its by murder i want to follow up on this   okay tarla grant seemed to have a pretty decent life  no apparent reason for suicide so keep it open for now   fuckin a well keep it open   id know that foul mouth anywhere   anton what are you doing here   i love you too baby  come on lets have some lunch   i have a fuckload of work to do  all right  all right but its a working lunch   ah solitude  something i wont enjoy again until i deal with jesse  the neighborhood shithead   hey dexter  hey   dexter i was looking for you  hello debra   hi  may i   yeah   frank lundy   anton briggs   my lover  friend my boyfriend   all of the above   so dexter i was wondering if youd gotten  the blood tox results back on tarla grant yet   yeah i should check on that right away   please finish your lunch   all done   tarla grant just like you said 36 years old  married mother of two   thats a shame   i found the matching   whats that   big case were working on   im afraid ive enlisted debra in another of my mad theories   ah  whats it all about   finding out who killed her   oh   i dont suppose you happened to bring the uh   30yearold file  read the husbands statement from 30 years ago  family never believed it was a suicide   but since trinity never leaves a trace  there was nothing to investigate   you give good room service angel   you know we should do lunch out more often   missed one     no arrests since she got busted  with rose back in high school  spotty job record but thats about it   its a stretch i know    nikki  nikki wald  im not sure miss nikki wald is home   okay  hey im sergeant batista from miami metro homicide   its rose   get down    shots fired 41st and andrews we need backup  good  yeah im good lets go   suspects johnny rose and nikki wald going northbound  on 41st street in a white sedan   i think it was gray  a lightcolored sedan  make model   suspects are armed and dangerous   rita thinks im with the neighborhood watch  truth is im gonna do a little more than watch  theres dad off to his weekly poker game    and if i were the delinquent son  i would take advantage of my fathers absence  going after him feels very familiar  except it wont have its usual satisfying ending  the best i can do is scare a little sense into this kid   hey  come on its the vandal lets get him   oh fuck  its watch and report assholes  not watch and chase  this is so humiliating   go that way   this neighborhoods gonna kill me   already i mean the kids arent even dressed yet   i know i know im early  just wanted you to see the latest work of the vandal  happened in the middle of the night  he obviously smashed the window released the emergency brake  gave it a shove and uh let it roll   so dangerous   is that codys bike   oh my god  what if he had been out here playing   these dummies share the same size and weight distribution  as our victim  at this height any variant in trajectory  resulting from a simple jump or being pushed off the building  will be evident in where they land   what if she took a running leap   people dont kill themselves that way  they just let go  oh hey either of you interested in buying tickets  to the dolphins game club level  ill let them go for 500 bucks   whered you get those  dexter   son of a bitch   come on we have dummies to drop   is he gonna pay me for those  must be weird for you  lundy coming back   why would it be weird youre weird   none of my business i know  butif i loved someone  and that person was gone  and then i moved on and then found someone else  and then that first person all of a sudden showed up again  i dont know ive never had that problem  but its gotta be a little confusing   maybe  a little   so then maybe if you know that its supposed to be  weird and confusing  then maybe its a little easier to handle   thanks   its always the same three kills with trinity  a young woman in a bathtub  followed by a mother falling to her death  and ending with a man getting bludgeoned   i put her in a short shirt so that we can see her panties  while shes falling   specific  how many times that you know of   ive got the bits and pieces  that add up to at least 15 cycles  since we just turned the clock back another 15 years  im sure there are considerably more   wow  thats impressive  in a very evil way   whats really impressive is that i cant prove a thing  could never get anyone at the bureau convinced  hes that good   why do you think hes so successful   trinitys likely someone whos gone his own solitary way  through life  so preoccupied with his own obsessions  that hes foregone all but the most rudimentary  of human connections   a lone wolf   exactly  its a little bit disturbing   yeah   i mean i could just as well  be talking about myself  sure ive been married  was married for 29 years happily  but even so  the only thing that really got my heart beating  was the hunt  im sure you cant relate   no sorry   and now here i am at 60  watching dummies fly off a roof  still on the hunt   it sounds like trinity is worthy prey   whats really got me intrigued  is the notion that hes returned to miami   hes come home   im not sure home is the right word  people like us dont really belong anywhere  we just pass through   drink up  youre next   the vacation murders  word is you know who johnny roses accomplice is   forget it youll get the press release same time  as everyone else  but my sergeant and lieutenant were almost killed yesterday  so if you put any negative spin on it ill be very angry   when youre angry youre very sexy  so this could be sort of a winwin for me   lets just say ill be angry in a very withholding  sort of way   okay  the bathtub murder  still under investigation   the jumper at the old port building   ditto  i gotta run see you tonight   sure   can you just go over the figures one more time   theyre not gonna change  the test results indicate that tarla grant jumped  rather than was pushed  i dont buy it  i think were looking at a murder victim   deb we also got the autopsy report  she had a small tumor  talked to the husband they just found out last week  maybe she was taking the easy way out   maybe she was determined to fight it  that doesnt mean she killed herself  i checked her cell phone records  no text messages no suicide note   not everyone leaves a note   i just got word  we will be debriefed on our shooting incident  in the morning   okay good   we need to get our stories straight  about why we left the precinct at 1230  and didnt get to walds apartment until after 300   we grabbed some lunch and then we had a flat tire   flat tire it is   you okay   ive read masukas notes  that along with the autopsy reports  leads me to believe that theres no reason  to keep tarlas case open as a murder investigation   lieutenant i think its premature to close it  lundy has this theory  you dont work for lundy  youre welcome to pursue this but between the vacation murders  and lisa bell i think youre gonna be very busy   youre on your own with this one   poor cody  ouch  whered the glass come from   that car on elliots lawn  cody was coming back from their pool  and he stepped on a piece   does he need stitches   no hes fine hes just scared  first his bike now this   poor guy give him a hug for me   hi  help me out here dexter  ive been going out of my way trying to make things good  with you but no matter what i do  you just throw it back in my face   you dont need to make things good with me   come on whats it gonna take   quinn  i dont care if youre a dirty cop   if i didnt take that money it would just sit  inside a locker until some fatass  who sits behind a desk grabs it to buy new carpet  for his office which he never leaves  i put my life on the line every day  i give this job everything ive got  and i cant even afford a down payment on a condo   i thought you had family money   had and that has nothing to do with anything  just dont fucking call me dirty   the last thing i need is a cop mad at me  look youre right i take it all back  i honestly dont give a shit  just keep my sister out of it okay   you dont understand any of this do you  you cant  cause youre not a cop  youre not one of us     cops another community im not part of     what   its so crowded in there   well i guess so a wife and three kids   theyre always there   tell me about it  it was easy living with anton when he was never home  id come back to a quiet apartment  and unwind without having to deal with anybody  now as soon as i walk through the door hes there  waiting to engage   theres no escape   and now lundy shows up   is that good or bad   i have no fucking clue    what   were complaining because people want to be with us  how lame is that  you think tarla grant killed herself   no i dont   masuka said she wasnt thrown or pushed from the building  she jumped what would make her do that   fear is a powerful motivator   you should go inside youre home   thanks  yeah   hi  hi sweetie   where is everybody   im in here   fort cody   hey buddy hows your foot   its better   good keep holding down the fort   okay   and ill take care of my end  once you guys go to sleep tonight   you may want to talk to astor   this is one of those moments when i wish  i was like everyone else  im sure other people would know what to say  hey  i know youre not a little kid anymore   duh   im sorry  its just  sometimes im  dumb   its okay  you can be dumb    thanks   what   its funny  a few months ago after a shootup like this  people saw me leaning against you  they wouldnt think twice   they still wouldnt think twice  they dont know anything about us   i know  but i think twice  im constantly worried that people will misinterpret   let them misinterpret  hey  i need this as much as you do   this dexter guy  first of all who the fuck is named dexter      oh that feels good  what did his parents know he was gonna grow up  to be a fucking egghead   i met him he seems okay   hes a lab geek  fuck that feels good   what else   what else im exhausted  i spent all afternoon in the sun  throwing dummies off a warehouse  cause super agent lundy has a hunch that  the dead woman is connected to this big serial killer case   hmm really   oh yeah lundy always gets his man   yeah  well so do i   this is where i first noticed the pattern  raleigh north carolina 1993   that got you curious   then i found san francisco louisville  detroit richmond  eight different cities in all that i know of  never the same place twice  until now  ready for another   oh yeah  so now this is your little retirement project  youre completely incapable of relaxing arent you   thats just it this is how i relax  i get the scent of a bad guy  i can feel my blood pressure go down   and here i thought i was bad   you are  youre exactly the same as me  just in a much prettier package   are you flirting with me agent lundy   simply stating the truth miss     thank you    excuse me just a second  hey   hey so you want me to order some takeout   im still working  so ill just grab something here   okay well i love you babe   me too     ah
