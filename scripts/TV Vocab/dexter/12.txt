prosthetic hand  john painted her nails different colors  but it didnt go nowhere  except she was just cut up by the icetruck killer  holy shit monique was a victim  now were operating on the theory  that he found out you were on his trail  and if were right that means you got stabbed  for a reason it wasnt no carjacking  how did he know it was me  no one knew what i was doing except masuka  someone else had to know think  i consulted with rudy  debras boyfriend the prosthetics guy  but thats crazy right  no shes been awol since going out last night to meet him  she was supposed to come back and help me canvass   but she never made it  thats not like her   angel we got to go  go just go  there are roughly 5000 cargo containers in the port of miami  finding the one where my mother was

blackout paul   its called a setup  well done  the last thing i remember  was standing in the kitchen talking to dexter  now he could have smacked me over the head and  dragged me out of the house probably through the backyard  you really are a piece of work  im telling you   dexter is not who you think he is  hello  this one ive got to make sure we got about seven copies of these  i want to

somewhere   my birthplace  now what  no cameras no patrols no dogs  with billions spent on homeland security  it cant be as easy as a couple of snips  so much for the war on terror  finding a needle in a haystack isnt hard  isnt hard when every straw is computerized  reefer yard plug 436  i dont like this place  something nameless was born here  something that lives in the deepest darkest hole  of the thing called dexter  get in there  somebody else  get in there now  its all right little guy youre safe now  nothing will hurt you  i promise  okay deb  dont be dead  s hit  surprise motherfucker  are you following me now  you better have a hell of a reason for being here  im looking for my sister  in a cargo box  yeah im kind of working on a theory  you forget you work for the

down here right now  miami metro pd  yeah is this guy under arrest  thats a good question  youre connected to this  i dont know how but im gonna find out  and some of what i find is gonna stick to your ass  let me out of here motherfucker  let me out of here  let me out let me out let me out you piece of shit  let me out of here you fucking piece  aah  fuck let me out  sorry but you were drowning out freds radio  and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels  bye  his happy place where he kills more than time   this is where hed leave me a clue   hey dexter better bundle up  i like the cold  you know hypothermia can easily sneak up on you  yeah and so can hypochondria  and a home setup like this would take years to put together  he must have hated leaving it behind  what are you looking for  a clue signature or calling card   anything that might give us a sense of where he went  well i dont think he was exactly thinking about us when he did this  i mean look at this place  hey you were right about the victim at santas cottage  he rushed his work  he killed that girl to keep us busy so he could escape  but he wouldnt go without leaving us a message  we just need to find it  check this out  this is where he played with his meat  pretty whacked out huh  i can think of 101 uses for this table  know what i mean  he has my sister vince  right  i mean  i didnt mean  im sorry  shit  youre karen right  thats right  youre in charge of evidence  this entire room  evidence  take photos of every item in its original position  workkit packages  show me the inventory list when youre done  is he in charge  guess he is now  rita  rita  hi im bob hicks  can i help you  i guess paul never mentioned me  im his narcotics anonymous sponsor  right  so having your sponsor do your dirty work   which step is that  see hes  hes just concerned for the kids  no hes concerned for himself if youll excuse me  i thought he was lying too until i saw the proof  what proof  well the xrays the prison doctor took of pauls head   they showed a skull fracture  yeah which i deservedly gave him  no you didnt  see after you struck him  the hospital took xrays  no fracture   but in prison a fracture  if you know paul  youd know hed bash his own head against the wall  to get what he wants  well i do know paul i think i know him pretty well  no listen if paul was attacked  the way that it happened  that takes expertise skill  no firsttimer is gonna be able to pull that off  yeah which is why his accusations are ludicrous  dexter spends all his time in a laboratory for gods sake  so youve been there  bob  you seem like a nice man  but this is none of your goddamn business  okay got it  we traced the name and social of rudy cooper  to a new jersey plumber who mysteriously died in 98  you got to be kidding me after all this  we still dont have an id on this guy  rudy isnt his real name   you trying to be smart  not trying no  if you fucking know his name you better   whatever it is going on between you two it ends now  what did you find in there   other than the obvious a lot of trace bloodstains  its probably where he killed them all  but id like to look at the rest of the apartment before i go  yeah okay   you mind if i  be my guest  its perfect  right out in the open  at least hes consistent  was  there anything else near this record player  yeah a fucking doll sitting on top  home sweet home  is he taking me back before the blood  to a place where a boy was born  home sweet home but which home  down on the floor please  its kind of foolish deb  i dont usually work this way  call it  an homage to a fellow traveler i greatly admire  laura moser  addict dealer   my mother  arrested in 69 again in 71  same address listed both times  1235 mangrove drive  they say home is where the heart is  maybe this is where i left mine  surprise  what are you doing here  whitechocolate mocha  your favorite  im gonna have to drink it on the road  you know ive never even been here before id love a tour sometime  yeah sometime thats not now  dexter whats going on  its deb okay shes in trouble  oh god is it serious  yeah actually its very serious  but i just cant worry about you too right now  she knows she knows she knows  been leaving a trail of dead bodies  authorities say their big break came  when they found a video of his latest victim  if she knows you yapping about it aint gonna change it shut the fuck up  the suspect is operating under an alias  rudy cooper  we didnt have his fingerprints in our criminal database  so his identity is still unclear to us   she knows she knows  so sorry mr batista  we had to take the psych overflow from county   but this ones harmless  yeah dont be so sure  we never take the violent ones  they have the arsonists the rapists  the psycho killers over there  i tell you  those people belong in prison  do they fingerprint psych patients at county  yes of course  half of them dont know their own names  got to id them somehow  that should take care of him enjoy the peace and quiet  id tech  hey its uh batista can you do me a favor  i need you to run rudy coopers prints  against psych mental and institution records   ring around the rosie    a pocket full of posies    ashes ashes    we all fall down   dexter dexter  where are you you silly little bear  im gonna find you  where can you be  you silly little goose im gonna find you  you silly bear where is my baby  where is my dexter where are you   here  oh my goodness  oh my goodness  you surprised me you stinky little bear  hey where could your brother be hiding  bynies right there   hey bynie  you werent supposed to tell her  you remember now  bynie  you always had trouble saying brian  i have a brother  a real brother   none of this foster bullshit  were blood brothers through birth and death  watching mom die   its amazing that we survived that isnt it  the chain saw the flying body parts the blood  you were there too  two days sitting in blood before they found us  but you were young enough to block it out  ive never forgotten the day that we were   born   exactly  wheres deb  i waited for you before we got started   debra  shes not in here  deb  debra  this is not the way i envisioned our family reunion  come on lets just sit down and have a beer  deb  that was the best wipeout  you didnt even cry  next time you try my skateboard  bend your knees okay  hi  hi  look out  i didnt want to do it this way  okay lets run his description against interpols fugitive list  in case he isnt american  rudy cooper  his real name is brian moser  angel what the hell are you doing here  i got a hit on his prints  from a tampa mental hospital where he grew up  he was institutionalized for antisocial personality disorder  at 21 they said he was cured they released him  run the name brian moser for credit cards  bank accounts realestate holdings   anything that might tell us where hes got morgan  listen up  weve triangulated officer morgans cellphone  last known location   which means hes got her on a boat  lieutenant we have his real name were digging into his records now  his names not gonna help us find him in open water  i want a coordinated search with the coast guard   waste of time  chain of command  flyovers helicopters whatever it takes  lieutenant that signal died last night  by now he has most likely taken her to his final location  noted  lets get busy people  flyovers look good to the press  but they wont find morgan  you think the press matters to me  it matters to captain matthews and he calls the shots  look i know you need to define yourself here  and putting me in my place is one way to do that  but one of our own is missing  and we shouldnt waste our time pissing on trees  i agree  i can also see why you were reassigned  and it has nothing to do with incompetence  and everything to do with the captain trying to save his job  okay  now i was hired with the directive  to not make your life easy  so youre gonna ignore the lead  you dont know me very well  but luckily for officer morgan  neither does the captain  nothing personal  i swore that id have a   beer with you before we got started  you made that kind of difficult  sorry  you dont ever have to apologize to me dexter  not for who you are or anything you do  looks just like it used to doesnt it  who does it belong to  me  i got it for you actually  im really more an apartment person  youre trapped in a lie little brother  the same lie they tried forcing me into   they  you know  doctors therapists group leaders   what a family they were  you were never put up for adoption  afraid not  you were 3  a little bird with a broken wing  first cop on the scene  harry morgan  he wanted to make you all better  but me   i could see it in his eyes  all he saw was a fuckedup kid   they all did  so they locked me up  i didnt even know you existed  of course you didnt  harry wanted to keep you all to himself  and while you were being raised by the morgan family  i only had the memory of a family  me  mom always told me to look after you  imagine how i felt  when i tracked you down and found out  you were exactly like me  i dont have to imagine  i know what youve been going through all these years   the isolation the otherness  a hunger thats never satisfied  well youre not alone anymore dexter  you can be yourself  with me   your real  genuine self  takes the breath away doesnt it  i think were ready for debra  ive prepared her just the way you like  this time well do it together  does it have to be deb  its the only way  but shes my  fake sister i know  tell me something  your victims   are they all killers  yes  harry teach you that  he taught me a code  to survive  like an absurd avenger  thats not why i kill  you can be yourself around me  who am i  a killer  without reason or regret  youre free  you can be that way too  what about the code  damn it dex  you dont have a code  harry did  and hes been dead 10 years  you cant keep him sitting on your shoulder  like jiminy fucking cricket  you need to embrace who you are now  i dont know who i am  of course you dont  youve been away from your family since you were 3  but im here now i can help you  we can take this journey together  i cant  not deb  oh no dont  dont say that  im very  fond of her  you cant be a killer and a hero

about killing deb  he seemed to feel like we have some kind of connection  hes not the only one  he said hed kill deb if i didnt show up alone  well you almost fucking got her killed  im gonna request an immediate suspension when we get back to the station  youre gonna what  morgan you shouldnt be out here  are you questioning dexter  morgan  back the fuck off my brother  he just saved my life hes

want to know that theyre safe  why are you doing this paul  you want me to be miserable and alone like you is that it  all i want  is for you to look for a shoe  a shoe  could be in the kitchen could be in the backyard  its missing i checked and it wasnt in the items  that they got from the motel room when i was arrested  and why would it be here  i was trying to figure out why my ankle was so bruised  now im thinking it got banged when dexter dragged me out   when my shoe was knocked off  good night paul  night  screw you  what did i just do  i drove away a brother who accepts me sees me  for an adopted sister whod reject me if she knew  and a foster father who betrayed me  thats what it was  a betrayal  the most important single fact about me   im not alone  and harry kept it from me  what do i really owe him after that  mr morgan  mr morgan  thats me  your sister has a few bruises but no major injuries  still you should keep an eye on her  ill write a prescription for a mild sedative  but shes okay right  she can go home with you tonight far as im concerned  or we can keep her here at the hospital  its your choice  dont worry the sheets are clean  we aim to please here at chez dex  ill be sleeping on the couch with a spring in my side  just to make sure youre safe tonight but  were gonna have to talk tomorrow about a longterm plan  after you get a good nights sleep

to be put down  why  because of your code  the safety of my sister  shes not your real sister  shes a stranger to you and shell always be one  i tried to help you by killing her  i know that  you should know this isnt easy for me  youve done more to deserve my knife than anyone  youre the only one i ever wanted to set free  youre the one that needs setting free little brother  your life is a lie  youll never be what you   sorry  i cant hear any more  cause youre right  how did you know he was here  a neighbor saw the door open  we got his fingerprints on the knife a note on the fridge  and a single incised wound to the neck  slight upward angle  even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke  looks like a clear suicide  he does himself the same way he did the hookers   poetic  retarded  look at him  hes dead  the icetruck killer always flaunted his kills  like he was untouchable  by taking his own life  hes preventing us from ever catching him  i dont care why he did it  im just glad he did  decaf mochaccino nonfat no whip  your favorite  i got your message  hows debra  she has all her limbs  thank god shes alive  that poor thing must be a mess   falling for a serial killer

find i can handle the truth  i wish that was the case  the reality is theres nobody left alive  who can handle my truth  doakes always sensed i was hiding something  now he knows  my devil danced with his demon  and the fiddlers tune is far from over  sometimes i wonder what it would be like  for everything inside me  thats denied and unknown to be revealed  but ill never know  i live my life in hiding  my survival depends on it  dearly damaged debra   shes here to face whats left of the monster  spit on his carcass mourn him  shes in hiding now too  harrys daughter will be damned  if she lets anyone see what shes suffering inside  thats her tragedy  my tragedy is that i killed the one person  i didnt have to hide from  and im the only one who mourns him  everyone else would probably thank me  if they knew i was the one who drained him of his life  good job in there dex you sliced him up good  in fact deep down im sure theyd appreciate a lot of my work  way to take out the trash thanks buddy  all right dexter protecting our children  this is what it must feel like to walk in full sunlight  my darkness revealed  my shadow self embraced  yeah they see me  im one of them  in their darkest dreams   sychraa
