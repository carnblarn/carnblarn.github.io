to do her job  everybodys trying to get a piece of debra right now  shes been through a lot  your sisters a big girl  and she can take care of herself  i dont see why this is any of your business  look i know you and i have had our little differences  you might want to keep in mind how all that started  so what are you saying  im saying the guy who saw the other guy  steal the money from the crime scene  wants christine kept away  sorry  sorry im late  actually thats bullshit im not late  i was hiding at the end of the hall  so i could tell you all at once and get it over with  um  thank you im great  no i dont need your help  and no im not gonna show you the scar  so please can we just fucking move on  and uh why is there a picture  of a fucking arm up there  well lets all welcome back detective fuckin morgan  i was just about to ask sergeant batista  to update us on his case  based on the fingerprints weve idd the victim  as estrella carazo 19 years old  she is a citizen of nicaragua  here on an expired visa  uh the me estimates that the arm  was ingested less than 72 hours ago  and the time of death less than 24 hours prior to that  she worked as a cocktail waitress  at the bayside club  but she also did some modeling  yeah she had a job scheduled four days ago  with a photographer named jonathan farrow  hes a very big fashion photographer  thats disgusting what the fuck  that is sick  even im disturbed by this  ms carazo didnt report for work  the night after she was scheduled to see farrow  the kicker is seven years ago farrow was arrested  in new york on suspicion of rape  the charges were ultimately dropped  so hes clean  when i spoke with the lead detective of that case  uh he thinks the victim was paid off  okay so hes dirty  the guys surrounded by a firewall of lawyers  hes well protected and playing hardball  maybe ill get a turn at bat  well hes agreed to come in for questioning this morning  but i doubt if well get anything out of him  id like to be there okay  well thank you ang sgt batista  excuse me  youre welcome lieuteant  whats with batista and laguerta  what are you talking about  theyre afraid to look at each other  why would that be  because theyre doing it  makes sense  when you put two people in a room together long enough  eventually theyre gonna fuck  oh wow thats so romantic  you should have that tattooed across your fat head  what  ill need to find the right activity for astor  what did i like to do when i was 12  okay then moving on  hi this is mr farrows assistant hold please  uh no im sorry mr farrow is not available  for any bookings right now  you have nothing better to do  i wouldnt say farrows nothing  compared to trinity he is  trinitys not going anywhere  with his kill cycle over  hes not a threat to anyone for the time being  not sure i could say the same about this guy  i havent the faintest idea who estrella carazo is  oh yes  god she had a nice ass  i shot her in my studio last thursday  for a jamaican rum campaign  nothing sells rum like a nice booty  what time was that   yeah then i drove down to the keys  for another commercial shoot  that lasted well into the night  that can be verified  by my assistant and about a dozen other people  tell me dexter  whats the real reason youre stalling  on killing trinity  i still have things to learn from him  i spent my entire life trying to teach you  not to be like him  you also taught me  i couldnt be with people i couldnt get married  you taught me a lot of things i learned were wrong  youre taking a risk here  isnt that what life is  a risk  any ideas who might have wanted to harm miss carazo  look the girl was gorgeous but she was fojj  fojj  fresh off the jumbo jet yeah  very rural you might say  sensitive guy  i like you  i could make you a star  i just need to get you in my studio  whip your clothes off and rough you up a little bit  i think you just jumped to the top of my list  its gonna be so nice  to finally have my own place again  nice apartment  yeah right  ive wanted it for years  whos was it  dexters  no shit  how come youre just now getting it  i mean he got married like what eight months ago  well he kind of held on to it for a while  for what like his secret fuckpad  no i think he just has a problem with change  hes very slow to evolve  anyway i should be going  yeah thanks for the help  im not suppose to lift anything for a while  you kept your apartment after you got married  what kind of guy does that  what are you hiding dexter  stay out of my life  i know this is like your place now  but are you always gonna like  have people here  yes dex sometimes im gonna have people over  this is uh the rest of your stuff from the house  thanks  im picking up right where lundy left off with trinity  i owe him that much right  so look  there are over 60 deaths linked to trinity   i have every little iota of evidence frank collected  except what was stolen by trinity  and im gonna run it all by laguerta tomorrow  with the kicker  that trinity shot me and lundy too  wow thats a lot  fuck yeah its a lot  debs right but it sounds like  some mad conspiracy theory  which is exactly what laguerta will think  when she hears it  im gonna fuckin blow her away  are these  theyre dads old ci files  didnt know you had them  so you havent told me how its going  your search  i finally got some real info  on who dad might have been seeing  my mother you mean  im having coffee with her tomorrow  okay now im confused  coffee  her names valerie hodges  i left a message for her like a month ago  and she finally called me back  not my mother  debras headed in the wrong direction  but when she realizes that and gets headed the right way  laura moser leads to brian moser  leads to the ice truck killer leads to harry morgan  so many little stepping stones  that lay a path directly to the real me  let me know how it goes  i will  hi dexter  hi dexter hey  hey sweetie  hey buddy  tough day  elliots girlfriend moved out this afternoon  oh thats too bad  whats too bad  whats too bad is  that i found all this fun stuff for kids to do today  and i cant do any of it cause im too big  like what  well for cody  i thought he might like to join the young sailors club  yeah  wow thats great  elliots son dannys in that  i think they have an outing this weekend  i wanna sail  then sail you shall  what about me  how does soccer grab you  you get to kick things  no thanks  okay how about ballet  yuck  okay  how about the little scientists association  why do you hate me so much  well keep working on astor  but this is a good idea  how did you decide to do all this  well i feel its my responsibility as their father  to help push the kids out into the world  make them prepared and selfsufficient  im impressed  dinners almost ready  good ive got an earlymorning meeting  okay two serial killers go for a ride  why do i get the feeling this joke ends  with only one of them coming back  ive barely skimmed the surface  of arthur mitchell  still so much to learn about handling the kids  the wife  choose your weapon  or maybe not  i have plenty of experience with the chainsaw  but its heavy difficult to wield  has a short reach  um axe  this is a little too into the woods for me  so what is it were doing out here  were gonna cut down a tree  oh  god damn it  want me to give it a try  stand back  so about the kids  uh one of them doesnt wanna do  any of the things i suggested  so dont make them suggestions  what do you mean  theyre just children kyle  if you let them do whatever they want  theyd suck their thumbs and diddle themselves all day  so why did we come out here  instead of just go to the hardware store  i dont want the lumber in the hardware store  this is better  yeah its better  okay arthur youre a bit off today  uh  kyle i didnt mean to hit it  of course not it was an accident  huh we should go  its gonna die its suffering  it needs to be put out of its misery arthur  you need to kill it  no ii cant  he spent his life killing innocent people  but he cant kill bambi  this is your new role model dex  its in pain arthur  please i cant  get that axe from him  kill him now  would you like me to kill it  would you do that for me  now dexter kill arthur now  man early mornings with trinity can be murder  lieuteant  the judge wont issue a search warrant  on farrows studio  no probable cause  well thats bad news  very cause im still sure hes our guy  i think this means hes my guy  and this case may be bigger  than what we originally thought  ive got the names of at least three models  from central and south america  who have all gone missing over the past year  all here illegally  now we know that at least one of them  worked for farrow  i figure he picks his victims  knowing that once theyve disappeared  their families have no way  of getting an investigation started  and i cant get a search warrant on this come mierda  fortunately unlike batista  i dont need a search warrant  keep working it find another way in  can i ask you something  off the record  go for it  is it true that you and batista  are in some kind of relationship  excuse me detective  its just that theres a rumor going around  then please stop spreading it  as a fellow woman in the largely male work force  id think youd have a little more sensitivity  to this kind of situation  sgt batista and i are coworkers and friends  shit  farrow has a reputation for partying  late into the night  and tonight should be no different  farrows trusty assistant closing up shop  right on schedule  estrella carazo  are those tears for real  i know you like to create images of violence  but this isnt fake blood im seeing  someone was hit right here  managed to make it this far  before she was  hit again  and then here  a fingernail  not exactly cinderellas glass slipper  but it is a fit  valerie that would be me  debra morgan i figured  sit down  i left you messages weeks ago  i figured you werent gonna call  well i was on a cruise  rich old men love to spend money on me  um so you use to work for my dad harry morgan  i did  i still have my sources  if thats what youre wondering  pick up where we left off  of course my fees gonna be a little higher now  no actually i just wanted to ask you about my dad  did you and my father  did you ever have a romantic relationship  oh um  im not sure romantic is the right word  i was one of his girlfriends  if thats what youre asking  there were others  i think he picked the cis  based on how good we were in the sack  im sorrythats just  thats just not the picture i have of my dad  oh  hey i knew he was a hound when i met him  we all did  i was one of his favorites though  i use to drive him crazy with this one thing  thats enough thats enough  thank you  thanks  does this mean youre not gonna hire me  i should have listened to everybody  it was a huge mistake to look into dads past  what happened  its too much  i dont need to know all this stuff  what stuff  dad was fucking valerie hodges  really  but apparently she was just one of many  its every fathers nightmare  disappointing his children  that doesnt sound like harry  thank you dex  i dont even know who harry is anymore  hes still everything you remember him to be  is he  we all have secrets deb  some of them shouldnt be found out  i dont have any secrets like that  no me neither  i should just leave it alone  my mother  yeah i think thats probably for the best  im gonna turn these in and be done with it  no you dont have to ill do it  thanks  you need to destroy that file dexter  close that door forever  i cant let her be cut up again  hey sweetie hey  not another gift  no its not a gift  its a push remember  whats that for  its for you its your new guitar  why  cause youre gonna take guitar lessons  says who  me  well see  i learned a long time ago you cant force them  to do things they dont wanna do  yeah i guess  so are you ready for your big weekend  what big weekend  the overnight camping trip with the young sailors  im not a young sailor cody is  im a 30something sailor  but you have to go with him thats part of the deal  they need adults with boats  youre signed up to take four of the boys  i didnt realize that  i didnt know id have to get so involved  this isnt a good weekend for me  dexter what do you have to do  thats so important  stuff  stuff stuff  you cant cancel because of stuff  cody will be so disappointed  well what time do we have to leave in the morning   if i cant do farrow tomorrow ill do him tonight  everythings ready  where are you going  i gotta prep the boat  if were camping out well need a tent  sleeping bags food water  i gotta get two childrens life vests  abduct jonathan farrow take him back to his studio  kill him cut him to pieces dump him in the ocean  honestly rita this is gonna take me a while  do you need some help  no i got it  this really means a lot to cody  me too  and suddenly  tonights the night  jonathan farrow party animal  okay jonathan party like theres no tomorrow  im on mr farrows list  i dont have all night  neither does jonathan farrow  excuse me could you tell mr farrow  i just saw a homeless guy throwing up  in the back seat of his car  quinn  what is he doing here  it couldnt be coincidence  this whole thing just became too risky  can you believe hes here  uh who is he  thats quinn  ive never heard of him  youd be making a big mistake  hello  hello yourself  you must be quinn  i am  this lab geek just fucking ditch me  okay tonights not the night  guess im prepping the boat to go camping after all  the biscayne bay boys  home of the seminole indians the spanish conquistadors  cutthroat pirates  and now dexter morgan and four skinny boys  harry used to take me camping  if i cant kill jonathan farrow tonight  at least i can make the most of my time with cody  see you just pull it tight like that  and thats your bowline  thats my personal favorite  you might prefer a tautline hitch though  ill show you on the other side  or maybe you wanna see a truckers hitch  thats a fun one  dexter  what  can i throw dirt clods  oh okay  you forgot the rope  right  you seem a little distracted  yeah well arthurs technique  of keeping the kids busy and therefore keeping me free  isnt working out like it was supposed to  so maybe its time to kill him  after farrow  hey  i just got the official go ahead from laguerta  to open a trinity killer investigation  really  she went for the whole  serial killer thing  okay lets call it a limited trinity investigation  whats that mean  right before i went in  i realized if i pitched the entire trinity theory  and i added that he also shot me and lundy  id look like a fucking lunatic  so i boiled it down to the bare essentials  which are  the bludgeonings  they still go back 30 years  so i can investigate trinity  without laguerta knowing im investigating trinity  smart  whats the next step  i dont know  i dont know but what i do know  is that trinity killed frank  and im gonna catch him  im sure you will  so sarge  whats this about you and laguerta  a little bump and grind  do not talk about lieuteant laguerta that way  comprende  wow im sorry  you must really dig her  angel  quinn just asked me  if you and i were bumping and grinding  debra morgan asked me the same thing  well not in those words  where are they getting this from  i dont know  its you  the way you keep looking at me  everywhere i go youre staring at my culo  okay that is so not true  it is too  now i know  that i have a pretty nice ass  but you gotta stop  i miss you angel  i miss you too  but we made our choice  yeah yeah  when all of a sudden  they heard a scratching noise on the roof of the car  what was that  and they thought lets get out of here  so they drove home as fast as they could  and when they got home  he went around to open the car door  for his girlfriend  and there hanging from the handle  a bloody hook  that doesnt even make sense  your turn dexter  uh actually i dont know any scary stories  oh come on give it a shot  all right  theres a man  you can call him the man of three  you can call him trinity  you can call him anything you want  but the fact is hes not a man at all  hes a monster  he was born in a bathtub filled with blood  for countless years hes roamed the countryside  killing the innocent leaving behind  bits of his dead sister  sometimes hell sneak up on a man  and raise his hammer overhead  and then hell swing it down  and smash his own thumb and then go crying all the way home  like a little baby  thats what happens  that was funny thanks  and now i think its time to hit the sleeping bags  you guys are beat youve had a huge day  hey buddy  you need anything  im good  do you need anything  no im good too   the kids wont wake up till its light out  plenty of time for me  what the hell is going on what is this  this  is the decisive moment  whats the name of the photographer  who always talked about that  cartierbresson rightright  once you miss it its gone forever  a perfect moment  frozen in time  something like that right  yes but  ow fuck fuck fuck  who are you  im the person whos going to to keep you  from killing any more women  what  ive never killed anyone  you killed estrella carazo  who knows how many others  i didnt fucking kill them  i photographed them  its too fucking bad theyre dead but i  too fucking bad theyre dead  life is hard and its brutal and ugly  and way too fucking short  thats why i shoot what i do beautiful women  who are bruised and cut and bleeding  oh fuck  its for the contrast  you add a little bit of the real world  it makes them all the more beautiful  until you kill them  if they could thank me they fucking would  because of my pictures  those women will live on forever  nothing lasts forever  man has always been drawn to the sea  but its an unnatural setting for us  a place of great danger  tides currents waves wind  each presenting their own hazards  none of which can be ignored  the slightest lapse of judgment  can be a mistake you might never recover from  but a good sailor doesnt fight  against these elements  a good sailor works with them  using them to his advantage  while others less fortunate might be forever cast adrift  often in several pieces  he always comes home safely  what the hell  isnt that  farrows assistant  i just arrested him for the murder  of estrella carazo  but no i thought  yeah at first it looked like farrow  but this is airtight  we got camera footage from the tollbooth  of him heading over to alligator alley  we got dna evidence we got everything  i killed an innocent man
