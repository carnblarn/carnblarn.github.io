                 previously on dexter   bathtub jumper bludgeon  lundy came to miami to hunt this guy  i think he got too close  and i think it got him killed and me shot   i cant even imagine looking into the eyes  of the person you love  watching as he takes his last breath   how much did you tell christine  about the lundy shooting   i learned my lesson  i never even took the lundy files out of the station  theres no way she could have seen it   how did she know that  how tall was my shooter   my height   then it wasnt trinity  look i know its really tough for reporters right now  so maybe i can give you  that interview youve been wanting from me   im married   we have this connection   i have dexter   that smudge you found at the crime scene  how do you think he got the ashes to stick to the wall   we got the killers goddamn dna   going out of town   yeah a four walls build   an outoftown build  is his cycle starting over again   this is where it all started  vera saw me  i startled

first   mr butler   wheres your mother   shes picking up rebecca from ballet  but shell be back any minute  i really dont think that you   jonah dont talk  just listen and answer  do you have any idea where your father is   hes at some teaching thing up in naples   how long   a couple days   a couple of days good  if arthurs process takes that long  the boy still has time   you know its like

need your help  dont you understand  the longer hes gone the better for all of us   jonah we both know what hes capable of   diddid he hurt someone else   i hope not  thats why i need to find him  to keep him from doing something really wrong  you have the chance to finally break the cycle   what do you want me to do   go through his desk journals computer  anything everything  find out what hes

trains arthur   my name isnt arthur its scott   look at that  its a thing of beauty   i want my mom and dad  whoowhoo  choochoochoochoochoo choochoochoochoo  choochoochoochoo choochoochoo  whoowhoo   if arthurs ritual like mine was born in the past  the past is where ill find him  his last cycle of kills took place in new orleans  matthew hicks ten years old  went to the local pool never came home  five days before a woman was found murdered in her bathtub  before   you always did have a soft spot for kids  they remind you of what you lost that day  in the shipping container   innocence   arthur said thats what he would preserve  in the boy he took  if each of arthurs victims  represents members of his family  then the boy   must be arthur himself  he was ten when his sister died  omaha another tenyearold goes missing  five days later another bathtub murder  st paul  denver   lundy misread the pattern   its not three victims he leaves behind its four  lundy didnt think to look at missing children  because they were never recorded as homicides   which means five days  before the lisa bell bathtub murder here in miami   another tenyearold went missing  my god the boys begin the cycle   hey   sorry working late   like always   is everything okay   harrison isnt sleeping  so im gonna keep him in our bed tonight   ill be there in a sec   okay   arthur could have that boy anywhere  and now therell be an army of police  and volunteers surrounding his parents  to help find their son  i need to be one of them  if arthur picked this particular boy for a reason  i need to know  come in   hey dex you wanted to see me   gordy thanks for coming   yeah sure no sweat whats up   i dinged a parked van last night  and i left a note  but the driver hasnt called me back  and im thinking after i totaled my car  i cant afford  to let the insurance companies get involved  you think you can do a stake and notify  so i can find this guy pay him in cash   yeah sure just uh give me the plate  and if patrol spots your van  ill give you a headsup on its location   perfect   hold on as soon as hes done with the uni im next   next for what  i have to talk to him   hes right in there   im still figuring out how to phrase it   how gay are you   look i  i saw something at thanksgiving i wish i hadnt   morgan  gordon  jesus ever hear of a comb  it looks like you have a cat on your head   im kind of on a mission here whats up   ive got that interview with quinns squeeze today   christine  are you sure its a good idea  to dredge up all that lundy stuff   actually ive got a few questions for her  i think she might have some ideas about who shot him  the real question is do i give quinn a headsup or   no you dont  i gotta go   just no hes my partner   yeah hes also her boyfriend  you dont know where his loyalties are  deb ive got field work ive got to do   yeah and ive got a briefing on trinity  in like two minutes  my case  i need your big brain bro   theres no new blood theres no need   no way  you do realize i will stand here all fucking morning  if trinity works in the public school system  and we cant get the okay to swab these guys  we are beyond boned   if hes even in the school system  sorry deb but the sooner this is over  the sooner i get to that missing boys parents   weve had better luck with private schools  and so far were looking at 240 males  who fit our trinity profile   well collect their samples and get them to masuka   oh wonderful more old man spit   dexter i need the blood evidence in that bar stabbing   proofing it   proof faster prelims tomorrow  where are we on the lundy shooting   im still on the foreign nationals  that were staying at the hotel  so no significant developments   when you say it like that no   okay   hey uh dex you got a minute  its about thanksgiving   later vince   uh  okay   uh lieutenant could you authorize this requisition  could it be so wrong if you and i  hopped on the first plane to an island somewhere   yes and this isnt a requisition  its a thai menu  mmhmm   thank you for bringing that to my attention sergeant   start at community colleges work our way up   detectives   babe   keep it in your pants shes here to see me   oh youre finally doing the interview   she is persistent   tell me about it   and when im done  everyone in miami is gonna know what a true hero is   dont forget your partner thats quinn with two ns   oh shit i forgot to run something by batista  will you show her to the box  and ill be there in two seconds   yeah   i need you to watch christine interview me   and i would do that why   this could have something to do with the lundy shooting  no significant developments remember   okay   im hungry   well why dont you put your pajamas on  and well have something to eat   no i wont do it  i wont do anything you tell me to   dont you understand  father drinks and mother pays the price  im just trying to protect you arthur   my name is scott   very well   mr smith  yes   im dexter morgan miami metro  im not here in any official capacity  i just want to do anything i can  to help find your missing son   we havent set up phone banks yet  but uh we have some flyers   may i take some with me   great   im the only one here who knows what happened  i could point the police in arthur mitchells direction  but the slightest misstep on their part  ensures this family is never whole again   is there any information at all on your son  a tip a lead a phone call  anything that could point me in a direction   none  i keep waiting for a ransom note  something   id better go post these  im gonna do everything i can to help you get your son back   thank you   can you imagine walking by your kids empty bedroom  not knowing where he is   no i cant   how does a guy like this make a dead body  just disappear into thin air   the gulf stream does the trick for me   but theres no ocean in omaha  des moines st paul or denver   the four walls houses  he goes to each one of those cities on a build  as a pretext for his killing cycle   construction site  would be a convenient place to bury a body   or to hold a boy captive   three years on patrol  two years in vice  why homicide   my dad was a detective here   hmm   but it was completely different being a cop back then   yeah i bet talk about your mans world   oh no no it wasnt just that  i think you had to rely more on your instincts back then  there wasnt all this forensics stuff  to lean on to break a case  back then you had to rely on your gut   amen to that   have you seen these   forensically were at a dead end with the lundy case  so i just stare at these looking for answers   you know what  ive got enough background info  how about i just write this up and give you a call  if uh we didnt cover everything   sure  can i ask you something  you live over in the gables right   yeah   ah that must be really nice  being away from all that touristy stuff   well i got lucky found a great building   yeah so the gables thats what like uh  where frank was staying   i guess  wow  you sure got to the crime scene fast  theres no traffic at 500 am   oh i know that  but dispatch didnt put out the call till 505  you were the first reporter on scene at 520   i like to roll out of bed and hit the gym early  i was on my way there when i heard the scanner   bullshit shes lying   um how do i get out of here   you just follow the windows  till you get to the elevator   weve got to tread very very lightly with it  if quinn  no shit  thats why im asking you to help me sort through this  tell me im not crazy  youre not crazy  i spoke to christine at your crime scene  hair made full makeup  no way she rolled out of bed at 500 am looking like that   im telling you she knows more than shes letting on  shes a hardboiled crime scene reporter  and she couldnt even fucking look at those photos of lundy   suspicious but it doesnt prove a thing   well theres something else  i know it sounds weird but the other day  she was talking to me about how i was  looking in lundys eyes when he died  how the fuck does she know he didnt die instantly   laguerta got broward county school district  to let us collect samples  still working on dade  great   everything okay   yeah great  be right there   great   we cant be doing this with quinn around   thank you   builds nearly finished  no ones here  theyre not here  fuck  hello   kyle i went through my dads desk  theres nothing here   what about his computer   i already looked  theresits just school stuff   look at the search history does anything stand out   okay okay okay one sec one sec  nothing really  we got some bible stuff  a hardware store a real estate agency  the local paper  the real estate site  what was he looking at   uh lets see  its just a bunch of homes for sale   an empty house  good place to ensure his process isnt disturbed   i can email you the list if you want  i dont have email   who doesnt have email kyle   off the top of my head people who dont exist  fax them to the kinkos near your house under my name  ill pick them up there   okay   jonah youre doing the right thing   you know how  how come youre the only one  who can see my dad for what he is   we have a few things in common   police are searching for a north miami boy  who went missing last night  tenyearold scott smith was in an arcade with his sister  and their nanny at around 745 pm  when the nanny susan peterson  realized that scott was no longer at her side  fight fight fight  fight fight fight fight fight   cody   let go let go of him cody   cody cody come here cody what are you doing   he said he saw dexter leave the young sailors campout  in the middle of the night cause he was scared  so i hit him   im so sorry boys huh   if my son said thats what he saw  i believe him  come on   why hello  im so glad i finally got you   actually im in the middle of a project   dad i really need to see you   you just did thanksgiving night   i cant wait another four months until my birthday  can we meet in between our usual visits  just this once   theres a reason why we only see each other  a couple of times a year christine  i have a full life and a family who needs me   im your family too  i need you more than they do   sorry sweetie itll have to wait  love you   i think im in trouble  dad   so are you gonna let me go   in due time arthur   why do you keep calling me that   is that food for me   you can have something to eat  once you put your pajamas on arthur  oh this is delicious   so far ive looked at six empty houses on jonahs list  this one not so empty   hey   dexter are you on your way home   just finishing up a few things   oh the baby has a fever  how long do you think youre gonna be   not very  theres still another house i can check on the way home   scott  scott smith   me and my kids got nowhere else to be  my babies just need a place to feel safe at night  we dont make a mess or nothin  you aint gonna tell   no  no i wont   shh  thank god  hey can you take him   yeah  oh hes so warm   yeah those shots really did a number on him  look can you take his temperature again  the thermometers on the counter  youre late big day   yeah i was helping out with that missing boy   oh thats so sweet those poor parents  speaking of which pauls folks called  they want to take the kids to disney world one weekend   you sure thats a good idea  ive never even met them   theyre nothing like paul  he was the abusive black sheep of the family  plus i think it would be good for cody right now   what happened to his eye   one of the young sailors said you disappeared  the night of the camping trip  cody was defending your honor   huh  the only time i left my tent that night  was to find a tree   well cody doesnt want to be part of the group anymore  he said he doesnt want to be around somebody who tells lies   too late    oy  you mind giving him a sponge bath cool him off  food will be ready when youre done   okay  okay   this is so frustrating  none of it makes any fucking sense   what if christine was covering for a source  that knew something about this   possibly  i couldnt even look quinn in the eye   dont worry  were gonna figure this out  we just gotta think outside the box   hows this for outside the box  christines the same height as the shooter   christine shoots lundy why   beats the motherfuck out of me  she doesnt have a record   you ran her prints   after the interview  i lifted them off some pictures i got her to pick up   maybe she has priors that she hasnt been nailed on   we get her dna we check it against the database   you and i both know  we dont have enough to get a warrant   think outside the box sergeant   nothing like clean cool water  huh big guy  youll be as good as new in no time  but will i  i killed an innocent man  when i left the campsite that night  now rita and cody have been drawn into defending a lie  my lie  trinitys not the only one  using his family as human shields   are you out of your fucking mind  no way christine had anything  to do with shooting you or lundy   youve been dating her for what two months  how well do you even fucking know her   what is this some morgan vendetta against me  is your asshole brother behind this   why the fuck would my brother have anything to do with this   forget it it  look youre probably right about christine  and i am totally offbase  but youre a cop and a good one  and i know you know what its like  when you have a hunch   who else knows about this   batista   great youre making me look like a fucking asshole   dont make this about you  does she keep a toothbrush here  christine will never know about this  and when the results come back clean  you can shove this up my ass anytime you want  i need you to get a dna panel on this asap   thats your emergency  project runway is on  fuck you   ill owe you one all right  whos it belong to   we may have a big fucking lead on the lundy case  and just fucking run it   six houses down another eight to go  and im running out of time  morgan   dexter where the hell are you   en route traffic   okay well the das all
