you  i followed him to an na meeting that asshole lied about that too   youre obsessed  im not  open your eyes  dinner was fantastic rita  i kind of like her  just calling to check in  imagine her face if i told her you and i spent the night together in a hotel  its over dexter  i hope with lundy itll be different   why  i respect him   you love him  no hes like my dad  you wanna tell me whats going on  you said im supposed to feel my feelings  now im telling you to get them under control  which step was that  use the entire canvas  start from the top work your way down  light feathery strokes  perfect  stunning  try longer strokes now  perfect  you really know what you want dont you  i hope you dont mind  some men do  ive always found instruction manuals  quite useful  your turn  what do you want  i think that was it  come on  you must have some  dark fantasies  unfulfilled urges  im pretty good at acting on those  really  then fuck me like that  your lights burned out  its the wiring  ive been asking  my landlord to fix it for weeks  now i can see better  thats where my landlord lives  now hell have to fix it  see you later  got to admire lila for taking things into her own hands  that includes me  mom  come on lets go no more moping  im not moping im sleeping  oversleeping 3rd time this week the only way you gonna get over dexter  is if you take charge of your day  come on youre not in high school anymore  go scrub your face and ill heat up some oatmeal  didnt hear you come in last night  well it was late  i was quiet  yeah youre good at quiet  guess you kind of have to be with me crashing here and ritas mom over there  you and rita fuck quiet too  and shes off right out of the gate  because me i wake the goddamn dead   its a problem  i know only too well  scary right  sometimes i disturb myself  so what kind of noises does rita make  could we not talk about sex  or rita  why  cause we broke up  for real  its over  you break up you get back together thats just what goes on  i mean you and rita are forever  say youre sorry and send some flowers  youre not hearing me  when all this blows over ill spend a few days at gabriels and  you can screw rita as loud as you want   big news dex  feel like i got caught in a wave  the miami tribune received a 32page manifesto in the mail  its looking good for the bay harbor butcher   ive heard that one before  look this may be legit  the manifesto includes the names of 3 victims we never released  that is big news  im heading over to the tribune now for special agent lundy  he put me in charge of the team   go angel  yeah im psyched  yeah me too im about to be published  i sent that manifesto to the tribune  guess ive been taking some cues from lila lately  and not just in bed  im tired of reacting to the moves of agent lundy  and his super posse  time to control their actions for a change  betsy court 16 bluntforce beating  looks like she was sunning herself and never saw it coming  who called in the body  craig wilson the stepfather hes right over there  wilson told the reporting officer  that he came home for lunch and found her that way  you and dexter resolve your issues  as far as im concerned why the bitch come crying to you again  theres blood work to be done and if you cant control yourself  i need to call in another detective  i wont say anything to hurt the girls feelings   goddamn it im not joking  do i look like im laughing   i wish you wouldyou used to  bullshit i never laughed  yeah youre probably right  im not gonna try to scare you anymore reality is youre out of free passes  i already stopped dexter from filing a complaint against you once   i never asked you to do that  i did it  out of my own concern over your obsessive behavior  im on the line so if you bully dexter in any way  if you even look at him wrong i wont be responsible for the fallout   you got it  i got it   youre backing the fucking freaktard  james  where you been dexter  you dont bring me doughnuts  you dont sing me love songs  how are you camilla  ive been better  well that doesnt sound good  sergeant doakes dropped by my file room yesterday  he requested the case files for the 1973 shippingyard murders  i gave him the same line i gave you when you came sniffing around  said all that old stuff was boxed up in the basement of city hall  that made him real angry  he scared me dexter  thats not right he shouldnt do that  i always assumed your father asked me to destroy those files to protect you  now  im not sure whats going on   camilla  now i dont want to know  i just dont want to get fired  im retiring next year did i tell you  ive been looking forward to staying home with gene  you wont lose your retirement i wont let that happen  i can stall sergeant doakes for a few days  but eventually hell figure out the files missing just like you did  and hell track it back to me just like you did  ill take care of this  you have my word  so much for threatening doakes  he wont back off till he exposes the twisted branches of my family tree  from my fathers indiscretions to my murderous brother  to the root of all evil  me   why arent you at the tribune  what for  our guys not gonna leave dna evidence on a document  but the thrill of the hunt  ive had that particular thrill ill leave it to younger men  besides  its easier for me to do my part from here  yeah what part is that  operating on favors political leanings  posturing  ive been trying to find the right music  right  so im off duty today but here are those marina reports  and after my workout ill swing by and pick up a copy of the manifesto  look at that board  these kills are precise  but theres also a fluidity even some improvisation  if i could just find the music  want to borrow my ipod  got any chopin  no fresh out of chopin  shit  chopins perfect  did you just swear  what can i say youre rubbing off on me morgan  but chopin is perfect  so this is how you do what you do  the truth speaks to me from a peaceful place  i got to set the stage to hear it  you know what i mean  i thrive on chaos  but this is good too  i didnt kill her  i was just trying to stop the blood  no forceful impact spatter  hes telling the truth i can tell  palms up please  when i found betsy she was still breathing  i wanted to help her  you believe me right  im just the lab guy mr wilson sorry  arms down at your sides please  blood misting  i need to collect his shirt for evidence  the girls mother was at work but she isnt really defending her husband  wilson and his stepdaughter fought all the time  the neighbors heard him yelling at her this morning  then he comes home for lunch motive and opportunity   whatd the blood say  the one on his hands could have come  from trying to help her like he claims  but i did detect blood mist on his shirt  a blood mist  the kind that comes from beating on a teenage girl  no  yes  youre absolutely sure  its too fine for a bludgeoning the mist is from a bludgeoning  mediumvelocity impact spatters no doubt about it  okay morgan make sure you get me your blood report as soon as possible  this is my chance to make doakes go away  without spilling a single drop of his blood  of course i have to sell an innocent man down the river  sorry mr wilson but i wont let you float too far  i was just thinking about you  i like the sound of that  yeah i had to do a little creative problemsolving  at someone elses expense  bravo  yeah i figured youd like that  whats up  well you know that art installation  ive been working on  the cannibals  theyre not cannibals how barbaric  their eating is symbolic of the way we consume others to feed our needs   thats what i meant  well  it sold  i didnt even create it to sell but one of my buyers  fell in love with it and i named an outrageous price  and she paid me a deposit on the spot  so  you in the mood to celebrate  definitely  im afraid we cant seat you tonigh twithout a reservation  as you can see we are completely at capacity  no im sorry you have to help us i made this reservation 2 months ago  this is our 10year anniversary  this is the place where dexter proposed to me  on the patio in front of the fountain  he told me to make a wish and when i looked down  there was my diamond ring  sparkling under the water  that is so romantic  in case youre wondering  theres nothing sparkling under that water tonight  im sure youll dazzle me somehow  youre a creative problemsolver now right  a changed man or at least changing  i suppose  theres no supposing about it dexter  youve taken control of your addiction in a way that few people do  its been about a week since weve even discussed your recovery  i think youre right   and you havent felt the need to use  incredibly no i feel  you know like im finally in control of things again  we call that warm fuzzy feeling the pink cloud  its when an addict experiences acceptance for the first time  youre saying it wont last  im saying that you have to work it thats all  but i know that you will  because i believe that weve found a true substitute  for your addiction  whats that  life  youre making us all look bad  im the manager of il bistro vino happy anniversary on the house  thank you  did you hear that darling  i heard it darling  enjoy your evening  thank you  happy anniversary my love   arent we in recovery  this its just bubbles  were not gonna shoot it up are we  you really have a way you know that  a way of what   of whatever the hell you want  well  heres to 10 more glorious years  of whatever the hell i want  hi im cody and i researched saudi arabia   for my cultural report  thats good sweetie  now look at me when you talk and try and stand up straight  my board  is covered in sand because saudi arabia is one big desert  one great big desert  one great big desert  it only rains in a tiny corner of the country  so they save rainwater  okay try and keep your fingers off your face  you dont want people to think youre picking your nose  you mean like this  cody you need to take this seriously  dexter said it should be fun  dexter does drugs hes wrong  i finished my homework  for the week  hey im home   mom  sorry im late  im so happy to see you  mom  what a greeting  okay why dont you guys go get ready for bed   really mom i just got home  they need their rest  i will be in in just a minute to check on you  those two are making great progress   progress towards what  their full potential  i know youre good at these things but now that youre here  have you thought about applying for a teaching job  no im through with the schools  well i thought teaching was your life  and your children are going to be the beneficiaries  of all that i have to offer  our injunction stopped  the tribune from publishing the manifesto for now  at the very least  well have time to get a jump on things before the news frenzy hits  so  lets take advantage of this window  our goal for the next 48 hours is to wade through  this shining piece of social commentary  ive never seen so many dense and convoluted ideas in my life  but we need to search them all for clues to his identity   so first impressions  i got something  there are a lot of literary references in this document   how do you know  i like to read books   what kind of books  all kinds who cares  anyway  i see lots of references like this one  you cant depend on your eyes  when your imagination is out of focus  hes a trekker  that shits straight from deep space nine  what mark twain said that  its one of his most famous quotes  twain was never on deep space nine he was on next generation   he didnt say it on star trek  so whats it from  a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  what other literary quotes are in that manifesto  this guy hes the best boxing student i have ever had  after four weeks hes getting in shots to my head  finally he says i think im ready im like ready for what  and he says  to kick my moms ass  im like youre learning how to box  because you want to beat up your mom  what the fuck  did you hear what i said i was gonna hit the showers   ill meet you back here in 10 minutes  okay yeah 10 minutes  who the fuck are you  im lila  pardon my tits  we thought you were crashing at your boyfriends tonight  we we who  dexter and i  could you wait here a minute  whos the skank   did knocking occur to you  who is she  and are you trying to fuck her or set her on fire  i didnt do this to you when you were riding  squarejaw guy with the handcuffs  thats different i wasnt cheating on anyone with gabriel  how could you do this to rita not to mention her kids   youre like their father  rita broke up with me okay  you fucked up dex   bigtime  excuse me  dont worry  she just needs some time to adjust thats all  i had officers tear apart the stepfathers house  no murder weapon but he had to hide it somewhere   wheres wilson now  interview room 2  we still have him   why didnt his lawyer post bond  well he tried but  i pulled in a favor at the court and got a bail enhancement  so they had to start the paperwork all over again  ill break that cocksucker today  what evidence you say we got on this guy  he was dripping in the victims blood he was home alone with her   they fought the morning of the murder  circumstantial  but the blood spatter on his shirt was a result of a bluntforce beating  id like to see the blood report  youll get it as soon as i do  if youre looking for me ill be questioning the suspect  theyre still playing my tune  its like im conducting a final symphony  requiem for demonic dexter  and forming the entire brass section  sergeant james doakes  when i reach the end  maybe i can lay to rest the monster formerly known as dexter  just hang in there mr wilson  ive asked a psycholinguist at mit to analyze our manifesto  his computer tabulates punctuation  misspellings and sentence structure  to identify a set of key words which hell use  to create a profile of our killer  complicated  stay on it  okay weve been at this too long  its 100  lets break for lunch   are you alright  yeah im fine  anything you want to talk about  no not really   if you change your mind  its my brother  he was dating this chick  supersweet a little doeeyed  but god for him fucking perfect and he just threw her away  im just pissed at dexter not to mention my boyfriend  who did absolutely nothing wrong  but every time he opened his mouth last night   i wanted to fucking slap him  youve been listening to chopin  yeah i downloaded a chopin  nocturne number 2 in e flat major  one of my favorites  it  can have this effect on people  it can stir up some dust  no shit  listen you can heal yourself sir  you just need to talk to me  get it off you otherwise itll haunt you for the rest of your life  why dont you just listen to me  i didnt do this  you cant say it and make it true  you have a conscience  and its really fucking with you right now   i wish it were me i wish i were dead  yeah  why are we questioning that guy  hes a murder suspect  no hes not hes innocent   what did you say  my blood report backed his story  mr wilson found her dead  like i told sergeant doakes at the crime scene  you turned in the blood report when  i dont know at some point before i went home last night  i put it right on the sergeants desk just like he asked  its a green folder  according to my findings the mist  on the stepfathers shirt was exhaled  from the victim when he tried to revive her  the autopsy confirmed she had severe internal bleeding  due to the bludgeoning  but he could have beaten her first  thats impossible  the crimescene photos show blood radiating outward  around the victims body  such a bludgeoning wouldve covered the killer in blood from head to toe  thanks  mr wilson youre free to go  lieutenant this man is a killer  this man has been through enough for one day  theres an officer in the hallway  hell see that you get your personal belongings back and take you home  thank you maam thank you so much   what are you doing  trying to save your career   did you even check the blood report  i didnt get the blood report  its on your desk and it exonerates your suspect  we should be out there looking for the real killer  thats not what he told me at  that motherfucker   hes good  who  morgan  he planned this whole thing maria that psychopath set me up  dexter again youre blaming dexter for this  do you have any idea how pathetic that sounds  this is not about dexter  this is about the poor judgment you have been displaying  in this department for months now   you want to work out  no  i wasnt talking about the gym  youre sweet but im really not in the mood  so what do you want to do  i think i want to break up  for real  yeah  is that okay  no its not okay  fuck what did i do  nothing i swear to god  youre smoking hot and  fun and   soulful and  age apropriate  but what  but  sometimes the truth speaks from a peaceful place  its taken me a long time to find that place but i think i have  and its telling me youre not the right one for me  im so sorry  you live in a nice neighborhood  yeah i had no idea im usually passing by at 35 miles per hour  im not a real big walker  everybody walks in london  of course theyre usually walking to the pub  how far are we going  youre a bit grumpy tonight  whats wrong  come on   dont close up on me now  no i honestly dont know  i mean thanks to you things are  actually looking up some people at work have been   after me i think i have em under control  so why the grouchiness  is it because your sister thinks im a trollop  its not just  deb its the suddenness of all of this  losing rita the kids  theyve been the only thing keeping me  human for a long time  were they keeping you human though  or were they the ones making you feel   like the monster that you were talking about  keep going  your friends and family have to accept you  for who youre evolving into now that youre clean  is that what i am  clean  cause i dont feel that way at all  no you certainly dont  god  i wish i could fuck you right now  whose house is this   couldnt tell you  god  hes a man of many talents  look im some old bitch  better not press our luck we should go  hi dexter  cody  can you come to my school tomorrow  whats at your school buddy  im doing my cultural report  saudi arabia  can you watch me im kind of scared  cody what are you doing  who is this  who was that  ritas son he wants me to come see him at school tomorrow  poor kid  he doesnt understand that youve gone  i think ill go  whatever you thinks best  hey guys  im home   hello  theyre in bed  why so early  cody is being punished for sneaking away to make a phone call without permission  astor joined him in a misguided show of support  well who was cody calling  he was trying to invite him to his school  can you imagine  mom we need to have a talk  i made a phone call of my own today  i spoke with aunt cecilia  she told me the school district fired you almost a year ago  we had philosophical differences  the educational system is falling apart  school should be life itself not a preparation for living  do you know that they give trophies to every child now   whether they win or lose  yeah i finally get it  it took me a few decades but its not just me  nobody can deal with you  you dont leave room for anybody else to exist  its not my fault that so many people are willing to settle for mediocrity  just look at you first paul then dexter  rita you lack even common sense  and now youre passing that torch  of ordinary character on to your children  shut the fuck up  nobody talks about my kids that way  thatagirl   thats what ive been waiting to see  yeah im done with you  no youre not  but you go you give me hell  no i wont do that  i wont let you turn me into you  heres whats gonna happen  first thing in the morning youre gonna pack up and go home  youll come and visit us for birthdays and holidays  but youre not gonna live with us anymore  well   if thats what i have to sacrifice  to get you on your feet  kill one man and youre a murderer  kill thousands a conqueror kill them all and youre a god  does it sound to you like our guy has a narcissistic personality disorder  a classic god complex  i think youre onto something  to tell you the truth i dont know what my alter ego  had in mind when he wrote that crap  i just pulled from various blogs on the net  mixed and matched presto manifesto  you finally decided to fight back  i been waiting  hope you dont expect me to comment on that so you can record it  on your hidden tape recorder i wasnt born yesterday  you might have been for all i know  your past is a bigger mystery than fucking jimmy hoffa  i tried every avenue legal and otherwise  but there aint no paper trail on the early years of dexter morgan  i guess theres no recorder running after all  no man  unlike you i do everything out in the open  in that case sergeant let me put this in the open for you  no matter what you try no matter when no matter how hard you work  ill always be a step ahead of you for one simple reason  and whats that  i own you  fuck  get him off of me get off me  why are you doing this  i want your gun  your badge and your police id  i want your access card too  now  type a statement that sergeant doakes is on administrative leave  pending an internal affairs investigation  you two get him out of here  thanks  what the hell happened  i dont know he jumped me  that guys always had it out for me   thanks for meeting with me don  i dont know what the point is  the district court injunction hearing starts in 3 hours  which everyone here knows were going to lose  dont look so shocked we always lose these things  you bastards and your free speech  my boss never lets me say anything  ill tell you what i will agree to dropping the injunction  which will save us days of courtroom arguments  and a boatload of legal fees  if we can agree  on some simple ground rules on how you publish that document  ground rules were not gonna have any ground rules  my only goal here  is to avoid compromising an investigation of a mass murderer  who could hurt a lot more people  give me just a second will you frank  i cant believe you got those assholes  to publish the manifesto without the victimsnames  and as a page3 story  no sense hyping it it might just inspire the killer to greater heights  wait  its quiet here  peaceful  its a good spot  for what  its 100  so it is  i brought my own sandwich  i thought you didnt like the quiet morgan  i didnt  i dont  when im alone and its quiet i get scared  shitless  like i start hearing whats really going on inside  i see  so if its all the same to you maybe i can just practice when youre around  cause when youre around i kind of feel like i can deal with anything  you know  like what happened to me  i dont have to run from it  i dont have to jump into bed with some guy and hide there  you give me strength  im kind of opening up here  what do you want me to say  i dont know  youre the fucking zen master figure it out  ive got plaque in my arteries i know the lyrics to elevator music  my hair isnt getting any thicker  youre gonna do great up there you just have to remember something   theyre more frightened than you are  no theyre not  are so youll be staring at them the whole time  if one of those unsuspecting moms or dads  does something embarrassing while youre on stage   like pick their nose  youre gonna be the one who sees it   yeah  thats power  now go have fun  dexter over here we saved you a seat  thanks guys  there you go  18000 ill send a truck for the piece tomorrow  i am telling you lila  this is going to create a critical mass for you  according to the psycholinguistic analysis of the manifesto  our killer is a white male  in his 50s  what else  the killer has no girlfriends   and considers himself a good catholic  hold on  how can you tell all that by putting words in a computer   i dont know its science  how about common sense  i think the guy were looking for is pissed off at god  thats why he kills people  really i found him very politically motivated  yeah like a modernday revolutionary  which would suggest that hes killing for social change  this is what he wants   whats that  confusion chaos  its what the killer wants  hes always been an intensely private figure  dispatching victims silently  now hes suddenly a media whore it doesnt make sense   hes creating a clusterfuck  very good officer morgan  the killers making us chase our tails you know what that means  he knows how we work look how he hits every major theme  political environmental religious  in one section he manages to weave together julius caesar  berlin germany the pittsburgh steelers and gandhi  its scattershot  he knew that this would send us scurrying like squirrels for nuts  yeah but to suggest that he might be one of us  how can you be sure  hi im cody and i researched saudi arabia  for my cultural report  my board is covered in sand because saudi arabia is one big desert  as you can see i used coffee beans to write saudi arabia  arabic coffee is very famous  im a little confused  lila is the one showing me how to take control  stop killing get my life clean  but its the 1st time since i went into recovery that i actually feel clean  the children in saudi arabia are just like us because they  this is the saudi arabian flag  the arabic letters mean there is no god except allah  do you know how tough it is for a woman in saudi arabia  they cant drive or have powerful jobs  or get this they cant even go to the movies without mens permission  after they turn 12 they have to wear long black sleeves  and they cant hardly even talk to men until they get married  the new king abdullah is trying to change some old bad rules  so women can do more things  thank you very much for listening or as they say in arabic shokran  i cant believe how calm you were up there  yeah you were like a professional talker  you were pretty good  can dexter come for ice cream with us  can he mom please   sure dexter can join us  i wouldnt miss it  maybe theyll have some delicious saudi flavors like sand or oil  hang on a sec guys  are you hurt  okay im coming now  i know me too  come on kids dexter
