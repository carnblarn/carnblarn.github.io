                 previously on dexter   think this is our guys work  the icetruck killer  laguerta insulted the real killers intelligence  and now hes getting back at us for chasing after the wrong guy  its the guard  tucci   i think hes alive  tuccis alive  the icetruck killer is  keeping him alive to perform amputations  hes sending me a message  he wants me to go there  please  he was left here so i would kill him   just kill me  i cant kill this man  taking tucci over to county alive  i dont know who your contacts are morgan  but you are my upandcomer  you saved a mans life tonight  the thing that surprises me most about rita is  how much i like being with her  theres all sorts of things i can do  what  what are you doing  whatever i want  my new friend thought i wouldnt be able to resist  the kill he left for me but i did  im not the monster he wants me to be im dexter  i like to pretend im alone  completely alone  maybe postapocalypse or plague  whatever  no one left to act normal for  no need to hide who i really am  it would be  freeing  stop grinning like a fucking psycho and get back to work  sorry sergeant  i was just waiting for forensics to wrap up before i  tear the bed apart  im not the only one who enjoys isolation  my shadow companion chose this place well  this was his sanctuary  for a while at least  all these people pawing over it seems  disrespectful  tell me the sick bastard bled on something dexter  he was here for days playing with sharp objects  ill keep looking but so far this place is spotless  amazingly so  the only blood i found belongs to the security guard   has he said anything yet  mr tuccis still unconscious  lieutenant up here  theres got to be something here find it  the guys not a ghost tony tucci is evidence of that  hey dexter you get all this blood on camera yet  its like shooting a jackson pollock  well your jackson pollock is in the bag  ready  okay  what was that   did you see that  what  damn rats  were all gonna get histoplasmosis from all their shit in the dust  well be coughing up blood skin lesions  mouth sores  lovely can we get the lights guys  you ever heard of ratbite fever  masuka whatd i say about the fucking rats  you havent found anything wont find anything   this is a bust right  in so many words  which means im just jerking off till tucci wakes up  so take a break youve been working this thing 247  or are you still avoiding a personal life  oh fuck you  and yeah im better off just focusing on the job  thanks guys   it doesnt have to be eitheror  maybe not for you  if i found someone so can you right  yeah the trouble is keeping them  tell  me about it  yelina are you okay  im sorry im fine  ernesto hasnt arrived   im sure hell be here soon  no  the coyote wanted more money and i didnt have it  coyote  you mean the man you paid to bring him here  he said he sent ernesto back to cuba  but that was a week ago  and no one in crdenas has heard from ernesto  yelina how did you contact this coyote  this was his number but its not working anymore  i was supposed to leave him money in a park  listen my boyfriend works for the police im sure he   no no no we cant go to the police  he said hed hurt my family in cuba  no its okay its okay dexter will know what to do  i feel just terrible for her  and they were supposed to be married after he got here  i do know someone in the department who deals with immigration issues   i can talk to him  thats really kind of you dex  i mean can you imagine  not knowing if your fiance is dead or alive  uh no  every night after work yelina goes  across the street to the beach  ive seen her there just  staring out at the water willing him to walk out of it  have you ever longed for anything like that  she wants something from me ever since the blow job  she assumes weve taken it to the next level  she doesnt know yet  i dont have a next level  well when i was a kid i would have killed for an atari  you know  cody would laugh at the graphics now but back then man  it always comes to this once sex is introduced  small talk no longer cuts it  eventually shell call me a science project  and slam the door in my face  but when do you think hell wake up  yeah i did call an hour ago  but theres a killer out there thats into whores and security guards  but ill bet nurses are next  yo check you  all mpd blue  shanda what are you doing here  you have another lead on the icetruck killer  man i got bigger worries than that sick shit  now i got me a girl on the inside right  im not springing your pimp if thats what youre after  oh hell no  but my landlords another fucking story   trying to kick me out of my home   shanda  he got no cause  except  hes a bornagain hypocrite motherfucker  yeah and you want me to talk to him  no i want you to beat in his pasty white face  morgan found this in evidence  masuka was gonna grease it through  a cigarette butt  jesus we could pull dna off of that or even a print  except it would be your print  you were smoking on a crime scene  not  on the crime scene  like on the wayfar end of the park  the whole areas a crime scene you should know that by now  maybe you ought to just calm the hell down my brother   who the fuck is that  give it a rest shanda  morgan go do something useful  go sit on that security guard until he wakes up  and do not talk to him without me  believe me  your maid is not the first one to get screwed  no shes a maid shes not my maid  so have you heard of any other cuban immigrants disappearing  a few  the poor bastards they spend their life savings  get stuffed into a fishhold  puke the whole 90 miles to miami  then they get here thinking im an american im free  except the damn coyote  he wont let them go till his family comes up  with a surprise release fee   if they cant pay  they disappear  freedoms just another word for one more way to get fucked  sounds like someones doing something very bad  you have any suspects  sure four or five mostly cubans themselves  but not enough evidence for a conviction  or even a warrant  if warrants were applied for their names will be in the database  look buddy i know you want to help out your maid  but there aint a hell of a lot you can do  youd be surprised  jorge castillo  number 3 on the departments list of suspects  but the only one even remotely close to the park  where yelina was supposed to drop the money  they never got enough evidence for a search warrant  but i dont need permission to keep an eye on this guy  no neighbors no foot traffic  its promising  a good place for human trafficking  or worse  excuse me private yard  im just praying you have a 69 stingray headlight somewhere in here  dave cutler  castillo im sorry but i dont  man my restorations almost done shes a beauty  i dont do individual sales mr cutler  but i can give you the name of a corvette shop i deal with  ill be happy to look around myself  no offense man but i cant take my phone orders   if

fishing i got a 32foot concept what about you  i got a rowboat with a hole in it  a lo major los pescados te encuentran  i dont speak spanish sir  sorry i just assumed you were cuban  american pal just like you  just like me  hes on heavy sedatives at the moment i think he deserves them  ill wait  hey  mr tucci  tony  im gonna find this cocksucker  i swear  i dont understand americas obsession with cars  i can just imagine squeezing rita and the kids into that thing  and hitting the open road  cramped quarters public bathrooms  hours of nothing but conversation  its someones american dream  my nightmare  this must be where castillo locks them up  but if hes killing them when they cant pay hes not doing it here  so where are they   dexter morgan  gerard here  theres a floater down in south beach morgue  could be a match for your maids fianc  shes a maid shes not my   is it all right if i bring her down  the sooner the better  okay then thanks have a good day  tonight at the salsa

senses im not a shoulder  bad sign  shes catching on  i dont know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube  is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean  if you ask me man its darwins theory at work  that must be what love looks like  the inability to feel has its advantages  sometimes   hey dexter   hey mindy   do you need any help  no  so are you gonna go to the spring formal  why would i want to do that  she wanted you to ask her to the dance dexter  thats not what she said  well you have to learn their signals  yeah well i dont really care about girls  i just like being alone  but  most normal people dont  and its important that you seem normal  even though im not  because youre not  well start you off with a temporary prefab  and then make adjustments as we go  rudy heres gonna put me back together again good as new  half the battle is attitude and you have a great one  well im alive  i didnt see that happening but here i am  yo pretty boy youre stealing my thunder  and i got a hottie waiting on me so  i dont know  i just might have to fight you for this one  okay well armwrestle later now get out of here  watch out for this guy hes a dog  excuse me  i know what you need guys but i didnt see much  well any detail will help mr tucci  well he came up on me from behind and  he wore a mask when he made me put the  the the things on the ice  gosh ill get it  angel of mercy just how merciful are you  you are a dog arent you  so the ladies tell me  can you tell us how tall he was or  if he was black white latino  white i think im guessing maybe average height   not fat not thin just average  i dont know  and when he started you know working on me  i was blindfolded so  did you hear anything  did he have an accent or anything  he didnt talk much or hed whisper  and thats all you heard  except the rats  sometimes they would crawl up on the bed and id have to shake them off  some crapass witness i am huh  youre doing fine youve given us a lot  yeah  you know sometimes when im trying to remember something  i close my eyes  really  we could even blindfold you again  im kind of tired right now  its okay get some rest officer morgan and i are leaving  alone  no pretending no hiding  no time to relax im too close  jorge castillo is bad that i know  but bad enough to have killed yelinas fianc  that i have to prove  jorges notsohumble abode  yeesh  new money  normal people dream of this   a new car a big home a boat at the reef shore marina  and a beautiful wife  too bad  i never enjoy making someone a widow  theyre so happy  she has no clue who shes with  maybe thats the secret to a successful relationship  mr perry you were on the grounds of the same hospital  where we found mr tucci and you were alone that night  it was just me and caesar my dog  he likes abandoned buildings caesars a ratter   what did this guy do  why does he look familiar  yes he looks like an actor from that john singleton movie  what was that  how about you focus on whether or not he was the man  you saw at the old hospital that night mr perry  well it was difficult to tell it was dark  you said you got a look at him  he had a cap  hey is that kg230 hooked into a digital cctb network  ooh you better have a hell of a firewall  you get better resolution with the 440 hello  were done here  give me a minute  morgan thank mr perry for his horseshit and send him home  christ on a crutch he could tell us something  sergeant doakes says he is a lookyloo  we get dozens like that every time a story hits the news  now do me a favor  get him out of my precinct thank you  you could try being a little more optimistic  i mean if tony tucci can be optimistic i think we can  you might get more out of people  how do you know perry doesnt know anything  because ive been doing this a lot longer than you  okay  this case is getting colder every minute  you waste on bullshit like perry  and wanting to blindfold a trauma victim  what the fuck were you thinking  tuccis closed for business now  and you shut him down  i i was trying a new approach  maybe you should just learn the basics  before you reinvent the damn wheel  come  on how can you not dance to this  its a gift  we just need some more patrn compadre  another round  no more for me i got to get up early  killers to catch  forget that the nights just beginning right ladies  yes  ladies excuse us angel come

alive  what about communication trust   la pasin  wait  what if she wants something more  then you reciprocate  you know la pasin  no i meant what if she wants something more emotionally  dont go down that emotional road just go down on her  its easier and shell be distracted  come on lets dance angel  so  what do you want to do now  dance with her dexter be polite  get her punch open the door for her  and if you find yourself alone with her and things get romantic   dad ive kissed a girl before   you have  yeah   and  i dont know it was okay  dexter women are different from men  weve had this

just wait and ill drop you at your car  wheres your bathroom  somehow its reassuring to know  im not the only one pretending to be normal  i found hair on this one that doesnt belong to tucci   rat hair  i probably picked up a parasite just   dont test me masuka  you see all that shredding  half of this sheet must be lining their nests  they took evidence away from the crime scene   exactly  so we check their nest  wild goose chase without knowing what were looking for  we could talk to tucci again  he knows more than he thinks and my gut tells me he can take it  cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force  masuka run the sheet see if we can trace it to manufacturer  ive got court in the morning so call me on my cell   all right i get it im a newbie  but you are old and tired and you need new eyes on this  so when youre ready to let me do my job you let me know  and dont you fucking say a word masuka  how do you get rid of the ones who dont pay out  you drop them in the middle of the ocean  tell them to swim for shore  you cant hide for long jorge   hello  dexter its me  look im sorry i havent talked to you since that place  the morgue  do you think theyll be able to catch whoever did this  im sure hell get what he deserves how are you doing  still a little shaky  i have some latenight work i have to do but i could  stop by earlier if you want   maybe we could rent a movie  yeah ill pick up a dvd   something light  maybe if i dont blink my eyes will tear up  i hate this  im questioning every move its exhausting  i should just break it off already  unless i can pacify her give her something  reciprocate  la pasion  dexter  im sorry i  i was just  you were so generous with me  i was gonna return the favor  no thats very sweet but  sorry im just not in the mood for that   that you dex  yeah sorry im late  its okay son you must have been having fun   no i pretended to  thats good dexter  dad  do you think that maybe one day ill  you know feel it for real  i hope so son  i really do  alone id be better off  relationships are too confusing  but this i can figure out  this i do well  jorge castillos boat if hes a killer then theres proof  theres always proof and ill find it  happy and in love  the perfect couple  i wonder if rita and the kids would like fishing  focus  if one of these matches the contact number for ernestos coyote  youre it jorge  he drowns them here then dumps them out there  if they wash up itll be chalked up  to another innertube mishap  yep   this i do well  think about his shoes  did he walk with a limp  did he move smoothly like an athlete  try to remember tony for me  i would if i could hon  youre a sweet lady and smart   using your charms on me  no no i dont mind  its probably the last time a woman will flirt with me  looking like this  its okay tony maybe later  we should try the blindfold  what   i dont want to do that  im sorry mr tucci  i cant even begin to imagine what youve been through  but its our job to make sure that  nobody else goes through it too  so morgan youre up  he was hard to hear i never knew where he was  so hes agile thats good tony what else did you hear   rats always those damn
