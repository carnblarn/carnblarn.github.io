something scary happening  hey its halloween put the book away  for your information im about to read a tale by edgar allan poe  wait thats a schoolbook dont worry you wont learn anything  its called the raven  once upon a midnight dreary  while i pondered weak and weary  over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore  i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping  as of someone gently rapping at my chamber door  just some visitor i muttered  tapping at my chamber door  only this and nothing more  are we scared yet bart hes establishing mood  ah distinctly i remember it is in the bleak december  each dying ember wrought its ghost on the floor  eagerly i wished the morrow  vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow  sorrow for the lost lenore  oh lenore  for the rare and radiant maiden whom angels name lenore  nameless here for evermore  the silken sad uncertain rustling of each curtain thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before  to still my beating heart i stood repeating  a visitor at my chamber door and nothing more  my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer  sir said i  or madam truly your forgiveness i implore  i was napping and you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping  tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you  here i opened wide the door  this better be good  darkness there and nothing more  you know whats scarier  what anything  back into the chamber turning my soul within me burning  soon again i heard tapping something louder than before  surely said i  something at my window lattice  let me see what thereat is and this mystery explore  i flung a shutter with a flirt and flutter  in stepped a raven of the days of yore  no obeisance made he not a minute stayed he  mien of lord or lady perched above my door  perched upon a bust just above my door  perched and sat and nothing more  thy crest be shorn and shaven i said  art sure no craven ghastly ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy name is quoth the raven  eat my shorts he says nevermore  and thats all hell ever say okay okay  then methought the air grew denser  perfumed by some unseen censer stupid censer  swung by seraphim whose foot tinkled on the floor  wretch i cried  god lent thee by angels sent thee  respite from thy memories of lenore  quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore  quoth the raven nevermore  be that word our sign of parting i shrieked up starting  get thee into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore  leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken  leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door  take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door  quoth the raven nevermore  take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door  quoth the raven  nevermore why you little  come back here you little raven  nevermore nevermore nevermore  the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting  on the pallid bust just above my chamber door  his eyes have the seeming of a demon that is dreaming  the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor  my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor  shall be lifted nevermore  lisa that wasnt scary not even for a poem  it was written in 1845 maybe people were easier to scare  like friday the 13th part i its pretty tame by todays standards  children bedtime  i guess ill have no trouble getting to sleep tonight  oh no marge come on please  im not sleeping with the lights on  theyre just childrens stories they cant hurt you  oh i hate halloween
