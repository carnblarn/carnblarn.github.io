at our table i feel like a kennedy  i dont see how that despicable man has a chance against mary bailey  our states most beloved governor  now heres the problem as i see it  while bailey is beloved by all  98 percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse  so we got the finest campaign team money can buy  this is your speech writer joke writer spin doctor  makeup man and personal trainer  their job to turn this mr burns into this  why are my teeth showing like that  because youre smiling excellent  this is the kind of trickery im paying you for  how do we turn joe sixpack against mary bailey  with this team your muckraker character assassin  mudslinger garbologist hello  their job is to turn mary bailey from this into this  visual aids help so much thanks  but first theres a burning issue that we need to neutralize  i hate that fish  thank you for watching movie for a dreary afternoon  next a political announcement from the friends of montgomery burns  burns change it you do it  i did it last week  fine be a jerk well just sit here and watch it  oh no an election thats when they close the bars isnt it  sorry barney  i wonder if hell talk about that fish  oh marge i bet

ill be sore tomorrow weve done all we can  the rest is up to you dont worry  when this announcements done  every johnny lunchpail in this state will be eating out of my hand  hello friends im montgomery burns your next governor  im here to talk to you about my little friend blinky  many of you think hes a a hideous mutation  that simply isnt true dont take my word for it  lets ask an actor portraying charles darwin  hello hello charles  tell them about your theory of natural selection  glad to every so often mother nature changes her animals  giving them bigger teeth sharper claws longer legs  or in this case a third eye  if these changes are an improvement  the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the earth  so this fish might have an advantage over other fish  it may be a kind of superfish  i wouldnt mind a third eye would you  no you see friends  if our antinuclear naysayers and chooseupsiders  came upon an elephant next to our power plant  theyd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman  this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that cant be beat  so say what you want about me i can take the slings and arrows  but stop slandering poor defenseless blinky good night and god bless  only a moron wouldnt cast his vote for monty burns  wow superfish  i wish the government would get off his back  that burns is just what this state needs young blood  i hope we can count on your support  homer im a bailey booster oh yeah well im a burns booster  congratulations mr burns the polls show youre up six points  giving me a total of six were on our way  my worthy opponent seems to think that the voters are gullible fools  ill rely on their intelligence and good judgment  interesting good luck  and i say taxes are too high  have you found any dirt on mary bailey  we went through her trash talked to her maid  the only dirt weve got is from a guy who dated her at 16  and he felt her up  not good enough  were gonna send a message to those bureaucrats  down there in the state capital  is your boss governor yet not yet son not yet  the voters see you as godlike hot dog  but the downside is youre losing touch with the common man  oh dear heaven forefend so the night before the election  we want you to eat at the home of one of your workers  i see every joe meatball and sally housecoat in this godforsaken state  will see me chow down with eddie punchclock  the media will have a field day  the only question is can we find someone common enough  well i knew there would be sacrifices  great toast marge oh by the way the night before the election  mr burns is coming to dinner what  and some camera crews cool man a media circus  absolutely not come on marge  im ringing doorbells for mary bailey  kids please leave i dont want you to see this  please please please please  wed like one of the children to ask a question  can you memorize this  your campaigns moving like a runaway freight train  why are you so popular very good  can i ask him to assuage my fears that hes contaminating the planet  and making it uninhabitable  the card questions fine i think her question is valid  dont worry im sure shell be able to memorize it by tomorrow  finally mr burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him  but remember he hates being touched  marge get back in bed no im fine right here  i just wanna snuggle i dont feel like snuggling  whats that got to do with it you dont let me express myself  you express yourself in the home you keep and the food you serve  okay homer fair enough you got it  all right good

congratulations mr governor  excellent bart would you say grace  god we paid for all this ourselves so thanks for nothing  only a child could get away with such blasphemy  god bless them all amen  hes smokin  you know mr burns my family and i feel that taxes are too high  where do you stand on this controversial issue  i didnt realize this was going to turn into a charged political debate  i was only reading i agree if i am elected governor  ill lower taxes whether bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not  lisa do you have a question for uncle montgomery  yes sir a very inane one  your campaigns moving like a runaway freight train  why are you so popular a tough question but a fair one  theres no single answer some voters respond to my integrity  others to my incorruptibility and determination to lower taxes  and the bureaucrats can put that in their pipes and smoke it  oh mom that felt awful im sorry it will all be over soon  but weve become the tools of evil  youre learning lessons tonight  and one of them is to give your mother the benefit of the doubt  or even a square deal  smells delightful  all right threeeyed fish can i have your plate  i dont believe it hes blown it  ruined before it hit the ground  heres your headline burns cant swallow own story  burns popularity has plummeted to earth like so much halfchewed fish  you must have a few tricks left up your sleeve  make coffee were not licked yet  yes we are come on wait come back  you cant do this to me im charles montgomery burns  smithers tip over this table yes sir  make them stop  mr burns  shut up and wreck something  i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions will accomplish  shes right take me home smithers well destroy something tasteful  ironic this anonymous clan of slackjawed troglodytes  cost me the election but if i had them killed  id be the one to go to jail thats democracy  youre poetic in defeat sir  simpson i shall make it the focus of my remaining years  that your dreams will go unfulfilled  youre busted dad  my dreams will go unfulfilled i dont like the sound of that  that means i have nothing to hope for marge cant you make it better  when a mans biggest dreams include seconds on dessert  occasional snuggling and sleeping in on weekends  no one man can destroy them  hey you did it
