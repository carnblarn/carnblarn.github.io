court has no choice but to  stop  principal skinner  i thought he was dead  i suppose youre wondering where ive been  it all started a week ago  i was at my desk  updating the school dress codes  when i was confronted by toughs  acting on behalf of one bart simpson  or so they said  we think the boy has promise  get out  to get my mind off that ugly confrontation  i went home and began bundling my old newspapers  suddenly the pile fell  i was trapped  let this be a lesson to recycle frequently  i stayed alive by eating my mothers preserves  and maintained my sanity  by dribbling a nearby basketball  i made a game of seeing how many times  i could bounce the ball and breaking that record  the police arrived to search my home  find anything boys  no sign of him  princess opal  im afraid

i had to do it myself  i formed a crude rocket  from a cigar tube  remembering an experiment from my days  as a science teacher  i concocted a fuel  from baking soda and lemon juice  the rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide  dragging a vacuum cleaner cord  i grabbed the vacuum cleaner  pushed the cordretractor button  and was on my way to freedom  and thats my courageous story  the prosecution moves  that this testimony be stricken from the record  denied case dismissed  your honor  uh do i still get paid  i hope there are no hard feelings  get bent  i deserve that  i know we let you down but me and the boys  we still think youve got a big future  in racketeering and extortion  i used to think your gang was cool  but now i learned  that crime doesnt pay  yeah youre
