refer to as fear of failure  bart is an underachiever yet he seems to be  how should i put this proud of it  one of his problems is a short attention span  blah blah blah  bart failed his last four exams is there anything you havent told us  everyone else in the class has shown some improvement  yet you continue to struggle why i dont know  look at these results 55 42 26 a 12 on state capitals  why are we dancing around the obvious  we all know it im dumb as a post  think im happy youre just a late bloomer  it isnt that simple  as emotionally crippling as it may be my recommendation is for
