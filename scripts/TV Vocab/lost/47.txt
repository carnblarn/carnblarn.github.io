names down four of your friends  we need you to bring them here  you have to bring only these four people michael just them  if you dont bring all the people on the list  youll never see walt again  ok ok ok  do you understand michael  yes what do i tell them  doesnt matter  make up a story  theyll be angry enough to believe whatever you say  whos james ford  you know him as sawyer you know the rest of them  yeah  i know them  if i do all this if i do what you say  youll get your son back  and you both go free  and i want the boat  when the plane crashed i was on my way to los angeles to bury my dad   im sorry to hear that  yeah  it seems like such a long time ago now  i was gonna go right from the airport to the cemetery but  i had no idea what i was gonna say  and here we are again  i think michael has been compromised   lets keep walking jack  what do you mean compromised  his actions are not of a man who is telling the truth  why would he lie to us  because i believe a father would do anything for his son  because i believe that michael may have freed henry  and because i believe hes leading you into a trap  you believe a lot sayid  and i also believed that henry was one of them   all right lets go talk to him  no he must believe hes in control   why the hell would we wanna do that  so we can create an advantage   how  i dont know yet  but we have one more night to figure that out  ana lucia cortez was  before we crashed she was a police officer  i dont think it was easy for her being here  but i think she did the best she could  she was a woman of few words and im gonna follow her example  rest in peace ana  libby was  she was  she  libby was a psychologist  or a psychiatrist  one of those either way she probably helped a lot of people  she helped me  she was my friend  its not fair that this happened to her its not  im going with you  goodbye libby  boat  boat
