this  wait  eko   may i  please be my guest  we were gonna have our first date  date  yeah  picnic on the beach  im glad youre ok man  john  hello im dr mark wickmund  and this is the orientation film for station 5 of the dharma initiative  station 5 or the pearl is a monitoring station  where the activities of participants in dharma initiative projects  can be observed and recorded not only for posterity  but for the ongoing refinement of the initiative as a whole  as karen degroot herself has written  careful observation is the only key to true and complete awareness   your tour of duty in the pearl will last three weeks  and during this time you will observe a psychological experiment in progress  your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island  these team members are not aware they are under surveillance  or that they are subjects of an experiment  working in eighthour shifts you and your partner will record  everything you observe in the notebooks weve provided  what is the nature of the experiment you might ask  what do these subjects believe they are accomplishing  as they struggle to fulfil their tasks  you as the observer dont need to know  all you need to know is the subjects believe theirjob  is of the utmost importance  remember everything that occurs  no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant must be recorded  each time a notebook is filled  with the fruits of your diligent observation  roll it up and place it in one of the containers provided  then simply place the container in the pneumatic tube  and presto  it will be transported directly to us  at the end of your eighthour shift proceed to the pala ferry  which will take you back to the barracks to prepare for your next  on behalf of the degroots alvar hanso  and all of us here at the dharma initiative thank you  namaste and good luck  would you like to watch that again  no  no ive seen enough  what are you doing  im taking this back with us  why  because they may be important  important  im sorry werent you just watching the same thing i was  yes john and i believe the work you have been doing  is more important now than ever  what work  pushing the button  thats not work thats a joke  rats in a maze with no cheese  it is work john we are being tested  tested  the reason to do it push the button  is not because we are told to do so in a film  oh well well then what is the reason mr eko  we do it because we believe we are meant to  isnt that the reason you pushed it john  i was never meant to do anything  every single second of my pathetic little life  is as useless as that button  you think its important you think its necessary  its nothing its nothing  its meaningless  and who are you to tell me that its not  thats flight 815 leaving from gate 23   thank you  840 starting to board at gate 16   what are you doing here  i had to see you   look your father said  i know  he doesnt want me talking to you and i know you probably think im crazy  but i have a message for you and i promised to deliver it  a message   he says you were a good priest  who says that  yemi  speaking about my brother is not a joke  so you should be very careful what you say next  i saw him when i was between places he said that you would come and see me  he said even though you were pretending youre a good man  who put you up to this did your father tell you to do this  he will see you soon  he said that even though you dont have faith in yourself he has faith in you  why are you doing this to me what do you want   why are you doing this to me  is everything all right  he has faith in you one day youll believe me  oceanic airlines flight 815 is now boarding for los angeles  this cross was worn by my brother yemi  yemi was a great man a priest a man of god  and because i betrayed him he was shot and died  he was placed on a plane  which took off from an airstrip in nigeria  half a world from here  then the plane that i was on crashed on this island  and somehow here i found my brother again  i found him in the same plane that took off from nigeria  in the same plane that lies above us now  that has concealed this place  and i took this cross from around yemis neck and put it back on mine  just as it was on the day i first took another mans life  so let me ask you  how can you say this is meaningless  i believe the work being done in the hatch is more important than anything  if you will not continue to push the button john  i will  can  can i talk to her  sure  hey  its hurley  hugo  im sorry i forgot the blankets  im sorry i forgot the blankets  libby   michael  michael  hes ok he made it libby its ok its all right
