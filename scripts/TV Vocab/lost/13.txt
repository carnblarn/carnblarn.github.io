the night  if theres anyone on this island your brothers safe with its locke  they teach you how to predict the weather at a box company  i brought you a present  for helping me with the translations  i didnt have a chance to get it gift wrapped so  oh  i found these in the wreckage and i have no use for them personally  theyre actually my size  well half a size off but i swear this place is making my feet swell  another mysterious force on the island revealed  yo boone   question for you dude  yeah  you and locke are hunting boar every day right   what about it  its cool except  how come youre not coming back with any  we havent had fresh pork on our plate in about a week  its not like theyre domesticated animals   maybe you arent trying hard  were hunting  i hope so cause people need food

to ask you about  um  anything i tell you is uh  doctorpatient confidential right  yeah  the thing is i havent been feeling so great  whats the matter  well its kinda like uh my stomach  ive been having some um  major digestive issues   what have you been eating  the usual  bananas papayas mangoes  guava passion fruit  coconut some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill  someone said theyd be good for digestion  let me tell you they lied  it might help if you had a little more protein  what can i do theres no boar no boar no protein  you can eat fish jins been catching a lot of em   that guy has it in for me  come on  im not kidding he offered me something to eat like  right after we you know got here   um that thing with the spikes  sea urchin  yeah when i turned him down its like  i soiled his family honor or something  he hasnt looked me in the eye since the guy holds a serious grudge  youre not eating those are you  dude these arent for eating  excuse me  i can see you there you know  i wasnt hiding  i just didnt want to disrupt you from doing  whatever it is youre doing   its not like its a secret  hard to tell with you sometimes  ah gross little grayish yellow

i wandered into this place the other day when i was picking fruit  this is beautiful its great  she planted some herbs and some lowgrowing stuff here  and then she started a grove over there  smart  with the boar running out were gonna need as much food as we can get   maybe its not running out  what do you mean  maybe lockes just decided not to catch it for us anymore   why would he do that  a lot of mouths to feed  if the boars thinning out why should he feed everyone else at his expense  that glass isnt breaking and the door is sealed shut  i think its cement   what is that  hmm  the stuff in the bowl what is that  its for later  not to be too difficult  but weve been coming here for two days just staring at this thing  im not really sure what were supposed to be doing  lodovico buonarroti  michelangelos father  he was a wealthy man  had no understanding of the divinity in his son  so he beat him  no child of his was gonna use his hands for a living  so michelangelo learned not to use his hands  years later a visiting prince came into michelangelos studio  and found the master staring at a single 18foot block of marble  he knew the rumors were true michelangelo had come in every day  for the past four months  stared at the marble  and gone home for supper  so the prince asked the obvious what are you doing  and michelangelo turned around and looked at him and whispered  im working  three years later that block of marble was the statue of david  were not gonna stare at this thing for four months are we  how we gonna open it  thats what we have to figure out thats why were sitting here  i mean how do you open a  hatch that has no handle no latch  no discernible way of opening it  yeah   im looking for shannon  who are you  im her brother   boone  whats going on  what are you doing here  fifteen hours i just spent  im happy to see you that might work  listen this isnt really the best time  bryan and i were on our way out to meet some friends  give me
