other  my name isnt hurley its hugo reyes  hurleys just a nickname i have all right  why im not telling  the point is we got to find out who everyone is   you want to start a census  a registry  names what people look like whos related to who  we lay down the law people will stop attacking each other  seems like someones punched or stabbed every other day  we got to find out who did this to her

hey you bastard dont you dare try and justify what youre doing  i have done nothing ive done absolutely nothing  what i have  you dont think ive seen what youve done   excuse me  you were supposed to be on the pill   you think i got pregnant on purpose  i dont even care  or that this was some kind of plan you are out of your mind   its over claire  no its not over   im out of here  thomas  john right john locke  is this about your census  yeah you know i thought it would be a good idea you know  get everyones name and place of residence  and whos checking on you  uh me  it was a joke   uh good one  yep  you already know my name  i lived most of my life in tustin california  cool and reason for travel  the reason you were in australia   i was looking for something  looking uhhuh  right on  something  so did you find it  no it found me   anything else  no no thats good  uh thanks  hey uh i know i already talked to you  but i just wanted to get away from him for a second  did you see anyone leave the beach last night  people come and go but  no i dont know  what   im not sure anything happened  wait what  claire told michael and i that this attacker  tried to inject her with something but there was no mark on her stomach  she wakes up two nights screaming first time sleepwalking  think shes making this up she was terrified  she said he was hurting her baby why would someone do that   with us 20 feet away  you think shes lying  no pregnant woman have extremely lucid   lucid  textbook anxiety nightmares  you know everything thats going on with everyone  so what do we do  claires due in a little more than a week maybe two  but if she stays stressed out like this  or has another panic attack it could trigger an early labor  out here with no instruments no monitors no anesthetic  that would not be good  its not all in her head   hey lance  sorry  lance your names lance right   ethan  dude thats right  lance is a skinny guy with glasses and red hair  i can see how youd confuse us  sorry dude lots of names and faces  pathetic youd think after a couple weeks on the island  with the same people wed know each other   youre right you would think so  so were doing this list  all the survivors names home addresses stuff like that  okay well you already have my name   all right not lance  definitely not   last name  rom   rom rom  thats right   great where you from ethan rom  ontario  right on love canada great uh  well that should do it thanks for your time dude   hey whats this for  oh its nothing  just you know thought itd be a good idea  claire  did you find him   um no  what if he comes back  claire  this situation that were in  the crash that no ones coming this place  it can kind of mess with your head a little  and make you see things that arent actually there  now i know it feels very real   i dont under  look your babys coming  soon  and i cant even imagine how scary that must be for you  but the more upset you are the more dangerous it is for you and your baby  so i want you to take these   what are they  its a sedative  very mild commonly used in situations like yours  it wont harm the baby i promise  you dont believe me   claire  you think im making this up  i get attacked and you want to give me sleeping pills  theyre not sleeping look its a very mild sedative   im leaving  what no claire claire  it was safe at the beach its not safe here   dont do this think about the baby  dont talk to me about the baby  im sick of everyone telling me what to do let go of me  you okay  what did you say to her   yes  mr malkin we met before   yes i remember  you wouldnt give me a reading  i was hoping you would now  if youre a psychic why do you have to count it   thats not how it works  i was just joking  so how does it work  i dont know  when did he leave you  last week  is that why you didnt want to do my reading  no no no i saw something sort of a blurry thing  and blurrys bad  blurrys bad  thats why i stopped the reading  are you sure you want to go on now  yes please  i can tell you  this is important   okay  it is crucial that you yourself  raise this child  you mean with thomas is he  the father of this child will play no part in its life nor yours   so what exactly are you saying  this child parented by anyone else  anyone other than you   danger surrounds this baby  danger  your nature your spirit  your goodness must be an influence in the development of this child  look if thomas and i dont you know get back together  im putting this baby up for adoption  i just wanted to find out what would give the baby the happiest life  there is no happy life not for this child not without you   i dont  there cant be another  you mustnt allow another to raise your baby  okay great thanks for taking my 200  look take it miss littleton i am begging you just to consider   i cant raise this child by myself  you have to listen to me  thanks for your time and my money back  the baby needs your protection  miss littleton please   hello  miss littleton its richard malkin    oh my god  listen to me i have a plan   something that will make this all better   youve got to stop calling me its too late all right  im going to see adoptive services tomorrow  ive been telling you for months  you cannot do that   what i do with my baby is none of your business  if you dont do what im suggesting   great danger will befall   great danger will befall you if you dont stop calling me   in the middle of the night  i know what youre feeling inside   youre doubting your decision to give up the baby   look im begging you dont do it  at least hear my plan first   good night  hi   where are you going  back to the beach   well what happened did jack  jack tried to dope me  he thinks im making all this

claire the pregnant girl  you know her she uh kind of got attacked   what  she okay   yeah shes a little shook up but  i am not moving to the rape caves  your life would be much easier if you just had

okay you do that  i hear you have the flight manifest  and i need it and want you to give it to me   that so  now you could do what you normally do  when someone asks for something tell me to screw

please let me carry your bag  im fine  i know youre fine but i can carry your bag  why did you come after me  well its probably because i like you   what  you dont like me charlie okay  you just want
