                charlie  charlie   how about you and i go for a walk  no  no thanks locke im gonna stay in today  come on  fresh air will do you good  i take better pictures than that  smaller too if you want something for your wallet  i just came by for a few things and this was  this was with my stuff  so youre not staying  call me a broken record but caves are natural shelter  and a hell of a lot safer than living on the beach   youre mad at me  no  kate im  i just dont understand why you wont come with me  us its maybe a mile up there if that   im not setting up house here  i want off this island too  but we know thats not gonna happen soon  sayid has a plan  to find the source of the distress code  the signals coming from the island  the signal has been running on a loop for 16 years kate  and the woman that left it she wasnt rescued  what makes you think itll be any different  i believe it  i wish i shared your faith  i wouldnt mind sharing a few things with her myself  what do you want sawyer  heard the doc here was vacating the premises  thought id lay claims to my new digs before somebody else  i could fix this place up might find somebody to share it with  ill talk to you later  locke  is that you  bless me father for i have sinned  its been a week since my last confession  go ahead my son  last night i had physical relations  with a girl i didnt even know  i see   anything else  yeah  right after that i had  relations with another girl  then straight after that i watched  while they had  relations with each other  you see its my band father  drive shaft  weve been playing the clubs in manchester  and weve been getting some heat  a following you know and  the girls  theres some real temptations that come with the territory  if you know what i mean  well we all have our temptations  but giving in to them thats your choice  as we live our lives  its really nothing but a series of choices isnt it  well then ive made my choice  i have to quit the band  and the meek shall inherit the earth  liam what are you doing this is a church   get your boots off  relax choir boy  i bring good tidings of great joy  weve just been signed a recording contract  youre gonna be a rock god  nice work charlie  you make excellent bait  im glad i could oblige  now give me my bloody drugs  did you hear what i said  i want my drugs back i need them  yet you gave them to me  and i bloody well regret it  im sick man cant you see that  i think youre a lot stronger than you know charlie  and im gonna prove it to you  ill let you ask me for your drugs three times  the third time ill give them to you  now just so were clear this is one  why why  why are you doing this to torture me  get rid of them and have done with it  if i did that you wouldnt have a choice  having choices making decisions based on more than instinct  is the only thing that separates you from him  three antennae  three points of a triangle  one here on the beach  another kate will position in the jungle roughly two kilometers in  and the third ill take to high ground up there  if the french transmission is coming from somewhere within our triangulation  ill be able to locate the source   but there are two complications  of course there are  the power cells ive grafted onto the antennas are dry  no telling how long theyll last  a minute maybe more maybe less  so we have to wait until were in position  how are we gonna tell that were in the right position  we have no way to communicate with each other  bottle rockets  thank god for firework smugglers when im in position  ill fire off my rocket  when you two see it you fire yours  as soon as the last one has gone up well all switch on our antennas   you said two complications  the battery in the transceivers dead  without the transceiver all of this is for nothing  something from a laptop would probably work   but ive not found anything  i think i might know where to look  youve been hoarding like a packrat and you dont have a single laptop  we are testy  still upset about your little breakup you and jacko  it must be exhausting   whats that  living like a parasite  always taking never giving  boy you got me pegged dont you  i get it you dont want off this island because theres nothing to go back for  nobody you miss and no one misses you  oh youre feeling sorry for me  i dont feel sorry for you i pity you  all you had to do was say please  whats in these things cinder blocks  packed everything i thought useful without leaving the others shorthanded  you guys need a hand  i used to lug the bands equipment  before we had roadies way back in the day   here let me  no charlie the zippers  broken   sorry i was trying to help  i know its okay  hey you wanna help me grab the rest of those bags  oh could i  what are you doing  oh uh i have a headache  diazepam  its for anxiety   i was looking for aspirin  pretty strong stuff for a headache   yeah right  hey   you okay youre

charlieboy we cant do this without you  you are bloody drive shaft  watch the language  this is our shot at the big time  what you dont want to be famous  its not about that i only care about the music  your music your songs that got us signed  im just a clown with a pretty face that sings them  you wanna take away my chance to be somebody  liam its not about you  its i love the band  its not

drive shaft  i wrote a bunch of tunes on that you all everybody   listen man jack just wants you to find another place for it  hes moving supplies and says its in the way  you know a lot of people

well look out for each other  calm down youre not yourself right now  you dont know me im a bloody rock god  oh no  oh  charlie wheres jack  wheres jack  jack   jack can you hear me  i dont know what happened  we were talking and it came down   it happened so fast  we gotta get help   go down to the beach and get help  okay im on it  and make sure you tell kate  what were doing  chasing some phantom distress signal  what are the odds of this working  no worse than the odds of us surviving that plane crash   people survive crashes all the time  not like this one  the tail section broke off when we were still in the air  our section cartwheeled  and yet we escaped with nothing but a few scrapes  how do you explain that  blind dumb luck  no ones that lucky we shouldnt have survived  sorry sayid but some things just happen  no rhyme no reason  hey  hey   we need help  whats wrong man   its jack hes trapped  what   our cave collapsed weve got to go  hey scott   im steve  im scott  we got an emergency lets go   we gotta go now  come on go  come on lets go  shannon you have to be ready to do something important  at 500 sharp you need to be ready to turn that antenna on   theres a switch at the base  why  kate and sayid are triangulating the french signal  but the antennas power is really weak  so you have to wait until they fire their bottle rockets  then you fire this one then you turn on the antenna  got it   the switch is where now  did you hear a word i said   can you or cant you do it  yeah i can  okay okay  wait kate   hey we have to tell kate about jack  sorry sport you just missed her  her and muhammad headed into the woods   which way  dont sweat it amigo   i know which way they went  but  ill tell her you just keep doing whatever it is you do around here   you all

check it out before you move things   if its unstable  how do you know  eight years of construction work i dont want you near the rocks   take the dog  you should get mr locke  lockes in the jungle killing stuff who knows where he is  all right this area here is load bearing  we gotta dig where theres no danger of the wall buckling in  all right here we dig in here so the wall doesnt collapse  four at a time by hand till we can find some kind of shovel  we take shifts and go slow  whoever isnt digging should be clearing the rocks  and bringing water to who is working okay lets move  hey  what the hell are you doing here  easy i just came to tell you something  what makes you think im interested in anything you have to say  you were right about me  that i dont help anyone but myself  well here i am ready to pitch in  youre here to help  hey you act any more surprised im gonna get offended  something wrong charlie  yeah jack  hes  theres been an accident in the caves  jacks trapped

feeling like this  come here let me show you something  what do you suppose is in that cocoon charlie  i dont know a butterfly i guess  its much more beautiful than that thats a moth cocoon  its ironic butterflies get all the attention  but moths they spin silk   theyre stronger faster  thats wonderful but  you see this little hole  this moths just about to emerge  its in there right now struggling  its digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon  now i could help it  take my knife gently widen the opening  and the moth would be free  but it would be too weak to survive  the struggle is natures way of strengthening it  now this is the second time youve asked me for your drugs back  ask me again and its yours  keep going keep going  were through we got a hole  jack  jack can you hear me jack  come on dude answer me   oh  i hear him   hes alive  jack bro you okay  im pinned i cant move  i cant move  what do we do how do we get him out   charlie was with me  hes okay he
