wouldnt be an irrational fear  if i could pull myself together  who is he how did he get here  i cant exactly perform an autopsy  but there doesnt seem to be any major trauma to the bones  we got another one over here someone laid them to rest here   who  i dont know  where did they come from  didnt you guys shoot a polar bear last week   yeah  whered that come from   any idea how long theyve been here  long it takes 40 or 50 years  for clothing to degrade like this  what is it  hello anybody there  everyone all right   a few stings aside  you two run away fantastically  im glad my diversion spared you  i was only stung several hundred times  oh and  someone left this  it was it was full of bees  id have thought cs actually  sorry  bloody hell  are these the people who were here before us  what are you talking about  well just  you know there could have been people here before us right  clearly  but who were these men  actually one of them is female  our very own adam and eve  ah  one of us should stay and help charlie salvage the wreckage   you offering  sure  give me a chance to get to know him a little better  we should move out people are probably getting thirsty  what  fortysix people need to drink a half gallon a day each  carrying all this water back and forth is gonna be a real pain in the ass  youre starting to make me regret volunteering  these caves make too good a shelter just to be used for burial  adam and eve they must have lived here  their plane crashed or maybe they were shipwrecked  they probably found this place and knew they could survive here  unlimited supply of fresh water  tree canopy keeps the temperature down  shields out the sun  the openings are narrow easier for protection against predators  we dont need to bring the water to the people  we need to bring the people to the water  i think we could live here  hey what are you doing  did you say something to my boy  yeah nice talking to you too  move it walt   how come he doesnt like us  what  you said people like him dont like people like us  oh man no  look thats not true and  i dont think like that anyway i was  i was angry   what did you do to him  what did i do to him  you tell me ive been with you since we crashed  have you seen me do anything to anyone  what kind of man do you think i am  what did your mother say about me  she never talked about you  you dont know anything about me do you   you dont know anything about me  i know a lot  yeah whens my birthday  august 24th  whens mine  forget it come on man   are you checking me out  what   theres no harm in it if you just  trust me  if i was checking you out youd know it  yeah then what were you thinking right now   i sure as hell wasnt thinking that  dont stop to think just tell me  i was thinking that if we were living at the caves  we could build a dam around that spring  so that everybody could have fresh water  and we could get the infirmary off the beach   you think its a bad idea  no no it makes sense  but   no but  good  a lot of people are still hoping a rescue boats gonna show up  they arent thinking about their own safety  were gonna have a lot of convincing to do  we  you still havent convinced me yet   are you following me  yes  theres no need im just going to the loo  is there something you want to tell me charlie   im going to the loo  its dangerous out there  until we get back im not breaking line of sight with you  bugger off  i know who you are and i know what youre looking for  drive shaft you played bass  and guitar  on a couple of tracks   youve really heard of us  because im over 40  doesnt mean im deaf  i have both your albums  although i thought that your selftitled debut  was a much stronger effort than oil change   its a shame what happened to the band   how long since you played  my guitar  eight days eleven hours give or take  you miss it  well a lot of wreckage it might still turn up  undamaged still playable i dont think so  i wish but there was this bloke at the counter who made me check it in   no  yeah  there wasnt enough room in the cabin fascist  youll see it again  oh yeah   what makes you say that  because i have faith charlie  its about time i am dying of thirst  i think ill let him sit in the sun a while longer  then ill take his wife aside find some way to communicate   she knows why he attacked michael  sure you dont want me to talk to her  if youve got that under control  im gonna talk to people about the caves  i might be able to get a few to go with me before nightfall  start setting up camp  youre serious  is there a reason you didnt consult us  when you decided to form your own civilization  im talking about moving to the valley  what happened to live together die alone  digging in together is the only way well survive  our best hope is in being spotted by a plane or a ship  for that we need to organize to keep that signal fire burning  while others scout for supplies digging in anywhere else is suicide  it is the only source of fresh water weve found sayid  and staying on the beach in the sun without water thats not suicide  i am not going to admit defeat  now what  i already gave you my statement sheriff  i came to apologize i shouldnt have been suspicious  you were the victim in the attack  i appreciate that  but i can tell you didnt come all the way over here just to say youre sorry  people are considering following jack to the caves  id like to know where you stand  right here  i got one priority and thats getting my kid off this island  a boat passes im not gonna be on the hook for missing it  good  slowly just a little bit at a time a little bit  glad youre coming  hey man i go where the boars at  so what up with you and kate  you guys gonna move into a cave together   am i in high school  well that wasnt a denial  just get your stuff together we gotta get out of here soon  well well well if it aint the belle of the ball  whats it like having the doctor and captain falafel fighting over you  just call em how i see em freckles  truth be told im not the only one wondering where youre gonna weigh in  on this moving off the beach thing  are you going with the pessimists or waiting for the rescue boats   are you going  well thats the real trick isnt it  we all pack up stakes for the caves next day a plane passes by  theyll go on their way and be none the wiser  on the other hand stay here  get eaten by boars fall off a rock  theres not gonna be anyone to answer that 911 call   you havent answered my question  you didnt answer mine  and i asked first  great look who came to chat  i need to talk to you  you speak english   yes  wait  you speak english   why didnt you say anything  my husband doesnt know  why would you learn english and not tell him  he has a bad temper  what my husband did to you today   it was a misunderstanding  no i got it   loud and clear  it was the watch  your husband tried to murder me for a watch  i found this watch two days ago  it belongs to my father  protecting that watch is a question of honor  trying to kill me in front of my kid is honor  you dont know my father  i need your help  listen to me you old git im going in the jungle  a man has a right to some privacy  just hand it to me  youre gonna run out  my guess is sooner rather than later  painful detox is inevitable  give it up now at least it will be your choice  dont talk to me like you know something about me  i know a lot more about pain than you think  i dont envy what youre facing but i want to help  do you want your guitar  more than your drug  more than you know  what i know is that this island just might give you what youre looking for  but you have to give the island something  you really think you can find my guitar  look up charlie  youre not gonna ask me to pray or something  i want you to look up  hey  its almost time to go  i dont want to be eve  no ones asking you to  i just cant  dig in  why not  someone else can stay here keep a lookout wait for rescue  why does it have to be you   thats not it  then what is it  kate how did you get to be this way  just what is it that you did  you had your chance to know  if you need me you know where to find me  you know where to find me too  i know you cant understand a word and im not the talkingoutloud type  but since i have a captive audience i hope for your sake you pay attention  im not exactly having the best month of my life  i barely knew my son and now i gotta be his daddy  and then to top it off i have a deranged korean guy trying to kill me  and for what  look i get it all right  its the watch mine broke  i found this in the wreckage  and i figured hey why let a 20000 watch go to waste  which is ridiculous since time doesnt matter on a damn island  son of a  stay away from me  and my kid  in 16 hours i land in lax and i need that coffin to clear customs  because there is going to be a hearse waiting there  final boarding call for oceanic flight 125  nonstop to
