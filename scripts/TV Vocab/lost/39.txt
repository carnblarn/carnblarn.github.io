problem is theres no way we can be sure hes telling the truth  that is not necessarily true  does jack have the combination to the armoury  for now he does  how long would it take for you to change it  if youre angry looking for someone to punish  why would i need to punish anyone  i want to find out who he is  i want the truth  we both know that jack will have issues with what must be done to get it  so how long john to change the combination  couple of minutes tops  then i suggest you get started   did he say anything while  no he didnt  he was in shock  we cant just leave him laying here jack  people will see him itll create a panic   where do you think we should put him  i say we put him in the armoury  its secure  better to err on the side of safety at least until we can be sure  ok  for now  we can pull that cot in here he shouldnt be on his back  good idea  sayid  hey what the hell are you doing sayid   what needs to be done  hey  the pilot was executed two days ago  he is buried in a field four kilometres from here  i can take you there  damn it sayid open the door   sayid answer me  jack  why isnt this combination working john  did you change it  yeah  why would you do that   youre raising an army  what  why you didnt ask me is your business  but theres only one reason to raise an army and thats because were at war  and like it or not whatever sayid has to do behind that door  thats a part of it too  what if hes telling the truth john  what if hes not  get up  whats happening  here let me help you  you said youve been here for four months  what  you said

merciless  and can take any one of us whenever they choose  so tell me charlie  have you forgotten
