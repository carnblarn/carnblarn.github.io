know what youre doing not gonna happen man get back to bed  whoa dude  please just listen to me  i keep telling you i dont know who alex is  im a survivor of a plane crash  i found the wire on the beach i followed it  i thought it might have something to do with  a transmission we picked up on a receiver  a recording a mayday  with a french woman repeating on a loop for 16 years  sixteen years  has it really been that long  you  you just happened to hear my distress call  i know what you are  rousseau   how do you know my name  i read it  there on the jacket  what is this place  those batteries wouldnt be able to produce enough power  to transmit your distress call all these years  broadcasts from somewhere else  but they control it now  they  you and the others like you  i  i dont know who you think i am ive already told you i am not  sayid   how  my name was on a jacket  yours is on the envelope you carry who is she  the woman in the photographs  nadia  her name is nadia  we cannot tie noor abed jazeem to the bombing  but we know her sympathies  shes a known associate of kurdish and shiite insurgents  she knows who orchestrated the bombing  that my friend is exactly what you will find out  noor abed jazeem  im going to ask you some questions  if you refuse to cooperate im going to hurt you  nobody calls me noor sayid  you of all people should know that  what  you dont remember me  am i so different from the girl in the schoolyard  who used to push you in the mud   nadia  and your mother would tell my mother  why must you pick on little sayid  and id answer  because he ignores me  you had enough attention  with your familys wealth and your charm  such things matter little to children  but then you always were older than your years  werent you sayid  not old enough to understand that being pushed  was a sign of affection  now youre a traitor to your country  tell me what you know about the bombing nadia  tell me or i swear i will hurt you  hmm oh i know sayid  this is not my first interrogation by the republican guard  this is where they burned me with acid  they pierced my hands with a drill  would you like to see the soles of my feet  where they flayed the skin off  these are handiworks of your friends  the people you swear allegiance to  if you were innocent im sorry  but this bombing is a different matter   nadia  go on sayid  do your work  im not going to tell you anything  then im going to hurt you  i know  you have a bullet wound  i was a soldier  you were  and are you still  it was a long time ago  tell me more about her the woman
