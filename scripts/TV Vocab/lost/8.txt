around sunset  well im afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is the boar  that i was skinning for our dinner  i heard you were trying to send out a distress call  so it would seem whoever attacked you has a reason  for not wanting to get off the island  maybe someone who is profiting from our current circumstances  and from what ive seen you and mr sawyer  share a certain animosity  no he has an alibi  just before i was struck he set off a bottle rocket  a signal wed worked out two kilometers away  he couldnt have had the time  unless he found a way to timedelay the fuse on his rocket   how could he  anyone who watches television  knows how to improvise a slow fuse  use a cigarette  just in case theres a next time  just try to breathe breathe  come on shannon work with me  give me the inhalers  now  hell i was wondering when you were gonna stop asking nice  well its about time cowboy  ive been telling you since day one were in the wild  didnt think you had it in you  is that

figure out why you beat up boone  instead of just telling him you didnt have his sisters medication  why you pretended to have it anyway  the thing that i keep coming back around to is that you want to be hated  and then i looked at the envelope  americas bicentennial knoxville tennessee  you were just a kid   eight maybe nine years old  kate  this letter wasnt written to you  you wrote this letter  your names not sawyer is it  it was his name  he was a confidence man  romanced my momma to get to the money  wiped them out clean left a mess behind  so i wrote that letter  i wrote it knowing one day id find him  but that aint the sad part  when i was 19  i needed six grand to pay these guys off i was in trouble with  so i found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money  and i got them to give it to me  hows that for a tragedy  i became the man i was hunting  i became sawyer  dont you feel sorry for me  get the hell out  get out  it was like some miracle she showed up
