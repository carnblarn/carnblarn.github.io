did you get that  war wound   looks more like a surgical scar  like i said war wound  the planes radio was boone able to pick up a signal  i was on the ground all i could hear was static   so it was working  yeah  but i cant imagine it survived the fall  some of its parts might work in the transmitter im building for the raft  if youd be willing to take me  of course   how did you find this plane  luck  you and boone were hunting   that a question  yes  boar got scarce a couple weeks back  we werent hunting we were exploring  so you just happened upon a beechcraft perched in the trees  yep  at the funeral you said your leg was injured  it was just a charley horse   a cramp  i know what a charley horse is john  back in iraq you were an interrogator   is that a question  yeah  a long time ago i was  well you havent lost your touch  why would i interrogate you john  jack called me a liar in front of every man woman and child  ive come to know over the past month  theres a part of you that thinks maybe there isnt a plane here at all  i know when im being lied to  theres a plane  like i said you havent lost your touch  youve lost your edge old man  i never had one when i played you  were you always this slow  come on lets play  you have to get out of that apartment practice more  haddad would like that  more blending in with the community  hes got his eye on a target  what makes you say that  for two weeks hes been asking me about explosives  blast radius transport  haddads very thorough  has he gotten hold of any yet  explosives i dont know  all i know is theres going to be an operation  and there is going to be a martyr  you  haddad told me this morning  come on lets keep playing   essam  im going to wipe the floor with you  what is it  what is it  i dont think i can do it   youre kidding me right  listen to me  i can get essam to turn himself in   does he know where the c4 is  the other two are the ones you want   essams confused  does he know where it is   no  then hes useless  these cells run top down its all needtoknow  the recruits handed a bomb and a target at the last possible moment  the way to find the c4 is wait for essam to walk out with a target to hit  hes in over his head doesnt know why  thats why you convince him to go through with it  no  no i will not   excuse me  im done its over  youre not even close to being done my friend   what are you going to do arrest me  no  well arrest her  your girlfriends an iraqi living abroad with a record of insurgency  wouldnt it be terrible if she got picked up as an enemy combatant  so if you want any chance of ever seeing her again  go and talk your good friend essam  into blowing himself up   the itsybitsy spider   climbed up the spout   down came the rain and drowned the spider out    when the   dude its washed  washed the spider out  unless theres some kind of british version  okay   down came the rain and washed the spider    oh bollocks shh shush  whats the matter man  i cant get the bloody thing to stop crying  maybe hes hungry  no claire nursed him five times  he make any deposits you know diaperwise  all right  time to break out the big guns   whoa i feel good   i knew that i would now   i feel good   i knew that i would now   so good so good   i got you bombombombom  ow  dude thats all i got  heroin  cargo hold is full of it  best i can figure they were smugglers  the plane was perched in the canopy  right up there  and boone climbed up by himself because of your charley horse  yes thats right  why did you lie  i made a mistake  im going to salvage what i can of the radio  if we leave now we should beat the storm back  why dont you trust me sayid  for one thing  youve been carrying a gun youve told no one about  we found one of the smugglers about half a click west of here  dressed as a priest nigerian currency in his pockets  and this  now youre armed and im not  does that earn me any trust  you gave this to me because i caught you concealing it  that earns you adaptability  ill tell you something you dont know  please do  a week after the crash there was a cavein   jack was trapped remember  of course  you kate and sawyer  went out into the jungle to triangulate a signal  yes  you were hit knocked unconscious  when you woke up the transceiver your equipment was destroyed  that was me  this is one time you better not be telling the truth   it was in everyones interest  ruined my chance to find the source  of a distress call saying theyre dead it killed em all  is that a place you really want to lead people to  why wait all this time why not tell me then  because back then you wouldnt have engaged in a reasonable debate  nobody else would you were so focused to get off the island  you werent seeing things clearly like whats happening with the raft   did you burn the raft  no sayid i didnt  what is the hatch  the hatch  boone mentioned it before he died  the hatch  two hatches on a plane could be forward or aft  im not sure if i can do this  you wouldnt be a martyr if you didnt have to overcome fear  im not afraid to die  its all the innocent lives all those people  the imam preaches peace sayid  that every human life is sacred  its true innocent lives will be lost in service of a greater good  what if im doing this because im angry  what if im doing this because they killed her  what if you are  should we just accept what happened to zahraa  what about others like her we just accept their deaths  because if we do it means ultimately we care nothing about them  i lost someone too essam  i will never be whole again  there need to be consequences for those responsible  thats my duty that is how i will honor her  haddad was right  it was fate that brought us back together  sayid  will you do this with me  i will  how are you   do you want to take a walk  sure   i spoke to locke  what did he say  he took me to the plane  i believe what happened was an accident  then why did he lie  i have no idea  but i dont believe he meant to harm boone  so thats it  i know how strong the need can be to find someone to blame  you dont get it do you   shannon  just forget about it okay  how much weight can this hold  i dont know  a lot enough  yeah tighter got it   what if it tips over  it wont  thats why we made it this wide  there that should do it  right good  good   all right  what if a shark attacks  sharks aint getting anywhere near us man  what if we die  we are not gonna die  boone died  michael do you know anything about babies  i cant get this guy to be quiet   walk with him hell
