spinal artery in the l5 area  plus all this extradural growth  im surprised it hasnt caused permanent ischemia  he says you dont need to talk in whispers  he knows he doesnt have a chance   your father appreciates candour  we both do  then tell him im very sorry  but hes not a candidate for surgery  the way the tumour is situated on the spine its not possible to remove it  he wants to know why you wont try  because what your father is looking for is not a surgical procedure  what he is looking for is a miracle  he said i did not come all this way for you sir  i came for him  ms busoni  you fixed a woman with a crushed spinal column  an impossible surgery and now she walks yes  i consulted many medical journals before making this trip  then you know it was a very different case under different circumstances  but a miracle right  everything that my fathers saying the risks the unlikelihood  hes absolutely right  but will you try  ill have to admit him in the next couple of weeks  run some tests  locke  john  stay in there   michael  stay in there jack   whatevers going on  im going after my son  and nobody is going to stop me  that is my right that is a fathers right  theres

bandages changed   why cant you do it for me  because im not your nurse  and jacks got the bandages  of course he does  wanna give me a hand  thanks  come on   this place still creeps me out  youll

been doing tests for a month now  im thorough  i have a confession to make  i dont believe in miracles  guess im not too sure about them either  i bet your wife feels differently  your wife she is the woman you fixed isnt she  yes  im thorough too  she must be very special to let you work until 430 in the morning  completely lost track   i gotta will you excuse me  of course go  and jack thank you  of course  good night  hey  how is he  hey sorry to wake you  i gotta get up anyway  so how is he  about the same  sarah im sorry i meant to  it just got  thats the price of being a miracle worker   where you going  i gotta go to the gym  then i got some papers to grade  i didnt wanna say anything until i knew either way but  i was late so i got a pregnancy test  dont worry it was negative  do you wanna talk about it  whats to talk about  sarah i  see you later jack  well  i cant say its definitely michaels but it looks like his boot print  theres one over here too  that sounds like a trail   you got a gun for me  youre not coming  excuse me  someone has to take care of the button  so why should that person be me  youre not coming youre staying  all right  lets go   whatd she do to you  what  kate whatd she do   she didnt do anything  right  yelling at her because she wanted to help get mike makes a lot of sense  why dont you go back and see if i hurt her feelings   im just saying  yeah i know   you love her  whatd you say  what  any of this look familiar from when you were coming back  yeah theres my favourite leaf how could i forget this place  whats wrong  when you came across the island what side was the ocean on  you came from the east michaels heading north  what the hells that supposed to mean  hes not going back to where you came from  hes heading somewhere else   hello hurley  hey  cool hat dude   is kate all right  yeah  i guess michael took off  what do you mean  he stole some guns and he went all commando  said he was going after walt  later dudes gotta get to the hatch  doc you wanna slow down  take a break a minute  good idea  he still heading north  yep   you think hes lost  doesnt seem to be  trails as straight as the interstate  the path of a man who knows where hes going  where are you going jack  what  lets say we catch up with him   what are you gonna do  im gonna bring him back   what if he doesnt wanna come back  ill talk him into coming back  this is the second time hes gone after walt  he knocked me out he locked us both up  something tells me he might be past listening to reason  you think we should just let him go write him off  who are we to tell anyone what they can or cant do  its not too late to go back  the tumours aggressive  but your father could lead a normal life for another year  go back where  home   have you changed your mind  no  is that it  even if you dont succeed youre giving us a chance  thats all we wanted  ill come out and check on you before i scrub in  ok  am i interrupting  no i was just leaving  ill see you in the morning  ill see you in the morning  itr reports need to be signed by you as chief resident  what  careful  theres a line son you know its there  pretending its not would be a mistake  guess you would know  it may be ok for some people but not for you  you sure mike went this way   why do you ask  i dont know mr clean  i probably would have gone around mount vesuvius  whyd you pick that name  aint it obvious  all you needs an earring and a mop  no your name whyd you pick sawyer  pick  after the census hurley gave me the flight manifest  your name is james right james ford  whats it to you  just an interesting name to choose  whod you get it from  who says i got it from anybody   michael  jack get down   michael  jack  michael   michael  jack  what   hes close  he was shooting at someone   you want them coming back  personally hell yeah  you said these people were two days away  they took cindy less than a mile from our camp  over here   shell casings how many  three michaels  you boys deaf i heard at least seven shots  you heard them daniel boone whats your count  seven sounds about right  its getting dark which way did mike go  what  you out here for michael  or just payback for getting shot  why are you out here doc  you got your reasons and i got mine  jack  jack   i had it  i know son  i got it all i had it  he was a sick old man on a table for seven and a half hours  his heart gave out its nobodys fault  ive got to go tell her  ive already done that  lest you forget i am still chief of surgery  where is she   maybe you should go home  where

dont want to find him  ive been running through the jungle toward the sound of gunfire  because i dont care about michael   dont turn around on me  you wont get him to come back  if we just turn around and go back were never gonna see him again  and thats gonna be on us on you and on me  youre exactly right  but if i were you id listen to mr locke  who are you  hes the son of a bitch that shot me on the raft  why dont you point the gun down  probably be best if we just keep our hands at our sides gentlemen   wheres michael  dont worry about michael  hes not gonna find us   what do you want  why dont you build us a fire  i think its time we all had a talk  geronimo jackson  as an expert in all things musical i never heard of these guys  shocking as that may be geronimo jackson  this looks sweet lets give her a rip  so what do you think is the story with that libby chick   the story  shes kind of cute right  in a ive been terrorized by the others for 40 days kind of way  there is that  i think i have a chance with her  its the classic desertisland scenario  if i ever had a shot this is it  you think claires missed me yet  dude its been a day   this music is quite depressing  we can change it dude  you ever hear of geronimo jackson  im afraid not where is jack and locke  they went after michael   michael  hes run after walt again   everyones gone to bring him back  whos

since the dawn of our species  man has been blessed with curiosity  you know the other one about curiosity dont you  this is not your island  this is our island  the only reason youre living on it  is because we let you live on it  i dont believe you   you dont believe what  i think you got one guy with a gun  i think theres more of us than there are of you  i think if you had any real strength  you wouldnt have had to send a spy  ethan  thats an interesting theory  light them up  we got a misunderstanding your people my people  so listen carefully right here theres a line  you cross that line  we go from misunderstanding to something else  give me your weapons turn around and go home  no   jack maybe  no  i hoped it wouldnt come to this  bring her out alex  she was following you  like i said curiosity  dont  the decision you gotta make right now is this  can you live with the fact that i shot this woman right in front of you  and you couldve saved her life by giving up and going home  or are you gonna give me your guns turn around and walk away  its your call   if you touched a hair on her head  shut up  im going to count to three  one  two  stop  now them  give me the other
