dear old dad mr francis price heatherton  who my friend is bloody loaded  how you amass this information never ceases to amaze me  ready to fall in love mr charlie pace  of the legendary rock band drive shaft  absolutely  oh seriously ladies i demand you stop buying me more drinks  im a man of high moral standing  your obvious plan to take me home and ravage me will not work  saucy sirens  i believe in monogamy i will not be shared like a curry   are we that obvious  dreadfully  call yourself ladies jane austen would be ashamed  i personally feel misunderstood im sensitive  the girl is pregnant very pregnant  are we to believe that she escaped from him   whatre you getting at  ethan infiltrated us  whoever he is and wherever he comes from hes intelligent   whos to say he didnt send claire  youre off your head mate  charlie calm down thats a stretch sayid  tell me doctor how many times have you diagnosed amnesia   and such a selective brand of it  okay its rare  shes been through a trauma  it is possible that her memory reset to the crash  and the chances of that memory returning   i dont know  you know what  talk about claire all you want im gonna spend time with her  i get the impression she might be a tad upset  oi jin  you heading back to the caves  safety in numbers right  of course you have no idea what im talking about  how nice it must be to not be involved in the bloody insanity  that surrounds us at every turn  its quite beautiful really  you take care of your wife  everything else is someone elses problem  no need to be involved in the decisionmaking process  no treeshaking behemoths french transmissions  just sweet bloody ignorance  you dont know how lucky you are  must be nice you wake up and  what  charlie i want her back   what  i want you to bring her back  what did you do to her  what did you do  you bring her here  if you dont im going to kill one of them  then if you dont bring her back before sundown tomorrow  ill kill another  and another  and another  one every day  and charlie  ill kill you last  what do we do   we go out and we kill him  calm down  we dont want the others to get upset   forget them hes out there now  i think hes right  the man threatens to kill one of us and what  we just wait for that to happen  we tracked him once before we can track him again  youve forgotten how that turned out he bested you physically  he hung you from a tree  running into the jungle is not gonna get it done   so what does get it done  we circle the wagons  tell a select few we post them as sentries here and at the caves  tell a select few  he does what he says hes gonna do and that bloods on our hands  okay jack we tell everyone  but you wanna protect them you need to think defense  we move everybody off the beach back up into the caves  what if ethan isnt alone  what if he delivered his threat so that we would gather like sheep  in a space where they could roll in and take us all in one fell swoop  okay john  i mean obviously you have a plan so lets hear it   the others are avoiding me  sorry  no one will talk to me  you know it just feels like somethings going on  anything coming back  after the crash no  some of this stuff is probably better forgotten  i dont know about you but the rest of us been having a wonderful time  we even built a golf course  you sure theres nothing going on  absolutely  okay  youre quite enamored of yourself  now lucy i know its our first date and you need to appear demure  but if you want to invite me for sex  dont say tea say sex   do you want tea or not  id love some

im not a cold man  i feel for the loss of one of our own  but nothing fundamentals changed  whoever he is wherever he comes from were on ethans turf  he has the advantage  to him were nothing more than scared idiots with sharp sticks  what if i told you that i had a way to get the advantage back  then i would ask what way might that be  why doctor youve been holding out on us  im guessing you know how to handle one of these  are you insane   its the best chance we have  no bloody way  to capture ethan we have to ensnare him the only way to do it   is by giving him what he wants  you have no idea  this guy he will kill all of you   you cant protect yourself  charlie i can talk for myself  claire they want to use you as bait  i dont remember ethan  i dont remember what he did to me  but if i can help stop him from hurting anyone else  i have to do that  im coming with you  you said there were four guns  you ever fire a weapon charlie  all right we should do this  lets figure out a game plan all right sayid soldier  locke youre the hunter  allow me to demonstrate the awesome speed  of the c815 using  one of your  technical manuals  not a problem theres probably something in here  one second one second  bear with me  charlies right  about what  we have four guns we should have four men  help moi   you know how to handle a gun or not  i know at least one polar bear seems to think so  whered you get the hardware hoss  i wanna come  sorry were out of guns  and no one goes out there unarmed  how much ammo you got   hundred rounds give or take  all nines right  nine

remember you shot him and missed  yeah well bygones  and hell five guns are better than four  youll be surrounded at five points  everyone will be in visual contact  make sure you stay in the area ive shown you  and remember the guns are a measure of the last resort  we want him alive  over here  jacks got him  hold your fire dont shoot  we want him alive  claire   you all right  yeah  over here   hey hold your fire  easy  winner by a knockout nice one doc  maybe somebody can tell me who or what this son of a bitch is  uhuhuh jungle boy not even for one sec  charlie  why did you do it charlie
