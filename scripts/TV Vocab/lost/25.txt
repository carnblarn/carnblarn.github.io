really think all this is an accident  that we a group of strangers survived  many of us with just superficial injuries  you think we crashed on this place by coincidence especially this place  we were brought here for a purpose for a reason all of us  each one of us was brought here for a reason  brought here  and who brought us here john  the island  the island brought us here  this is no ordinary place youve seen that i know you have  the island chose you too jack  its destiny  did you talk with boone about destiny john  boone was a sacrifice that the island demanded  what happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events  that led us here that led us down a path  that led you and me to this day to right now  and wheres that path end john  the path ends at the hatch  the hatch all of it all of it happened so we can open the hatch  no no were opening the hatch so that we can survive  survival is all relative jack  i dont believe in destiny  yes you do  you just dont know it
