its real man  none of its happening  its all in your head my friend  the second you closed that window your brain popped a gasket  you went back into your coma thing  and thats where you are right this very second  in your own private idaho inside santa rosa  no  i had  my mom  my friend johnny   i won the lottery  whoa wow  awesome dude  what numbers did you play  leonards numbers right from the hospital what a coincidence  you seen them around anywhere else   the hatch  bingo the hatch  with the button that you gotta push every 108 minutes or the world ends  oh oh oh and whats the code for the button  oh yeah the numbers  but i got better   i changed  changed are you kidding  youve been on a deserted island for over two months  and you havent dropped ten pounds  how is that even possible man  i just destroyed my stash ive been exercising   libby says it wont  right libby  the megacute blonde chick  who magically appeared from the other side of the island  oh yeah and who just happens to have the hots for you  come on man lets take a walk   so this is all in my brain  every rock every tree  every tree frog even me the real me the one they told you was imaginary  he went out that window man  right now hes probably bouncing from hot chick to hot chick  unlike me whos really you  whos got more important things to do   so im making you up  well sorta  im part of your subconscious man  all the people on this island are  what part of me are you  im the part of you that wants to wake up man  follow me  this is it dude   it  the big finale  the answer to all your problems  a way for you to wake up snap out of it  i dont wanna kill myself  who said anything about killing yourself man  this is gonna bring you back to life  the only way for you to bust out  is to tell your mind that you dont believe any of this  so  if i  all this will be gone ill just wake up  thats right  and when you do wake up come find me  im sure i miss you  see you in another life hurley  dave  jack not back yet  nope hes telling everyone at the beach that weve got one of em  something tells me people have a lot of questions about our houseguest  i want to talk to him  i dont think thats on todays program  well all due respect ana lucia but i dont care what you think  five minutes  i earned five minutes with him  whats your name  your real name  why dont you just keep calling me henry  ive gotten used to it  did you get caught on purpose  you and your people have been here for god knows how long   and you got caught in a net  god doesnt know  excuse me  god doesnt know how long weve been here john  he cant see this island any better than the rest of the world can  may i ask you a question  what possible reason could i have for putting myself through all this  maybe your people were looking for this place  this place  this place is a joke john  what are you talking about  i crawled through your vents  and i stood at your computer as the alarm beeped  and you know what happened  the timer went all the way down to zero  and then some funny red pictures flipped up in its place  they looked like hieroglyphics but im no expert  then things got real interesting  there was a loud clunking  and a hum like a magnet a big magnet  it was really very frightening  and do you know what happened next  nothing happened john  nothing happened at all  your timer just flipped back to 108  i never entered the numbers  i never pressed the button  youre lying  no im done lying  dave  whos dave   what are you doing here  what are you doing here  how did you know where i was   jin saw you while he was fishing  ha jin doesnt speak english  sun was with him she translated hurley what is going on  no youre just the part of me thats scared  you dont want me to wake up  well guess what im not scared  ok hurley youre having some sort of panic attack  i get that   but this isnt like you  like me you dont know me  i was starting to  yeah well did you know im so fat that i killed two people  and that i have an imaginary friend  hurley please youre gonna hurt yourself  no im not because this isnt happening  none of it im just imagining it  this isnt real life  why would you say that  because in real life  no girl like you would ever like me  you remember when i said i knew you from somewhere  well maybe its cos i made you up  what was the mans name who broke his leg  the day of the crash on the other side of the island  eko brought a man with a broken leg to me for help  what was his name  i dont know  you dont know you know why  because it happened to me  his name was donald and i buried him  i buried a lot of people hurley  so dont tell me that that wasnt real  and dont tell me you made me up  its insulting  when you saw me on the beach this morning was i holding a slipper  no not that i can remember no  hurley  look at me  i am real  youre real  the way i feel about you thats real  and that was real  maybe you should do it one more time  just to be sure  ready to go back  do you really think i can you know change  yeah  yeah i do  why dont you get a little closer together   say cheese  cheese  great  you need some water to go with that   nope im good  ok well fine  see you later guys thanks for the photo op  heres your pill libby
