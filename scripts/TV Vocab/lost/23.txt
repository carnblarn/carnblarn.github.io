                previously on lost  i found the wire on the beach  i thought it might have something to do with a transmission we picked up  a frenchwoman repeating on a loop for 16 years  has it really been that long  have you seen other people on this island  no but i hear them they whisper   we need to get off  are you suggesting something  yeah we build a raft   youre making a lot of progress  yeah trying  got this bamboo for the decking  a piece of the fuselage for the cabin  itll work we can do this  its been raining every afternoon  that means that we are on the cusp of monsoon season  why are we listening to arzt youre a damn high school science teacher  i was assuming you didnt want to die   so when do we have to leave  yesterday  yeah all right    whatre you doing  watching tv   yeah oh yeah   yeah the powers amazing   oh man you see what time it is go back to sleep walt  i always watch this show  okay then  could you at least turn it down  i said turn it down

are coming  our ship went aground  on this island 16 years ago  there were six of us  my team six  by that time  i was already seven months pregnant  i delivered the infant myself  the baby and i were together for only one week  when i saw black smoke  a pillar of black smoke five kilometers inland  that night they came  they came and took her  alex  they took my baby  and now theyre coming again  theyre coming for all of you   whos coming  the others  you have only three choices  run  hide  or die  this woman blew up her own shelter  now she talks about black smoke and hearing whispers  shes not playing with a full deck  that doesnt mean what shes saying isnt true  you can focus on the what ifs  im sticking with the tangible and thats the launching of the raft   hows it going  i wanted to get off today  but realistically man after we get the rudder done  we still gotta lay the rails to get her down to the water  wouldnt it save time to lay the rails while you finish the rudder  manpower shortage  what do you need to lay the rails and move the boat  get it all done today pretty much everybody  all right give me 20 minutes  grab as many palm tree logs as you can find  the longer the better over to the raft area   michael knows what to do  see ya then  you need to get em in there tight  and leverage to get em on the rails  yeah thats good  good thats good  okay thats good man  just get it under there okay okay   you all right  yep  so listen on my count  ill do one two three lift and then push okay  got it okay come on  once its down to the water line well drop it and load it up  all right ready  one  two  three lift  push  push come on guys  push push  use your levers use the levers  yeah good good  one two three lift  hey keep it straight  oh no come on i

space  this is a mistake we dont know about these others  were reacting with no information no intelligence this might be theirs  black smoke doesnt mean   it means theyre coming  yeah we got that  you boobytrapped your shelter with explosives have any more  dynamite at the black rock  in the dark territory  thats three reasons to go right there  if were to make it back by sunset  we have to leave within the hour  tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon  why were you yelling  the girl at the checkin counter  you were yelling at her  im sorry uh do i know you  im on your flight la  so your dad died huh  i thought you didnt hear what i was yelling about  i was being polite  yeah my dad died  how  a heart attack  not a drinker huh  no not really  no ring cause youre single or because you

into the jungle for supplies  well be back in a few hours  in the meantime do everything you can  to help michael get that raft on the water  and after that go to the caves  well be back as soon as we can i promise  hey nice speech  plans a little flawed but nobodys perfect   my plan  your plan go in the jungle  and get dynamite and blow open a hatch  and then hide everyone inside  you wanna keep a secret dont tell the fat guy  what do you want arzt  god knows how long that dynamite has been out there  and from what i can tell madame nutso  doesnt seem too concerned with how to handle it  so unless you want to blow up im coming with you  okay grab some water bottles  were leaving in a half an hour  we can salvage the cables but we need new bamboo for the mast  we need to fix the rudder before we start to think about that   you need help  lets get this done first  hey this wasnt my fault so put me to work  no offense we just work faster this way okay  all right what do you think im

boomsticks huh  yeah  time you get back well be in the water  guess this is pretty much goodbye then  yeah i guess it is  good luck sawyer  jack  about a week before we all got on the plane  i got to talking to this man in a bar in sydney  he was an american too a doctor  ive been on some benders in my time  but this guy was going for an alltime record  so it turns out this guy has a son  sons a doctor too  theyd had some kinda bigtime falling out  the guy knew it was his fault even though his son  was back in the states thinking the same damn thing  see kids are like dogs  you knock em around enough  theyll think they did something to deserve it  anyway  theres a pay phone in this bar  and this guy  christian  tells me he wishes he had the stones  to pick up the phone and call his kid  tell him hes sorry  that hes a better doctor than hell ever be  hes proud  and he loves him  i had to take off  but something tells me he never made that call  small world huh  yeah  good luck jack   youre gonna be armed  yes sir an ankle holster  stow this in the crew luggage compartment in front  no problemo  why do you need five guns  gee you wanna tell him kate  why do i need five guns  shes shy  whats this then  thats a good story you wanna tell it  huh kate  this belonged to her childhood sweetheart  who she got killed a couple of years ago  when she was on the run  poor guy had a wife twoyearold kid  what was his name  somewhere during the three years i was chasing her  she starts calling me at my house  and whining on about her mitigating circumstances  but what shes really doing is taunting me  so i tell her that ive got  whatshisnames little toy airplane  in a safe deposit box in new mexico  so she somehow figures out which bank  which safe deposit box  she seduces some idiot to rob the damn bank  then puts a bullet in her new friend because shes done using him  but she leaves all the money she just takes the plane  because thats the one thing in the whole world  that kate does care about  she has no attachments  and i think shes telling herself she needs it  to atone for killing her boyfriend whatshisname  come on what was his name  tom  it was tom you son
