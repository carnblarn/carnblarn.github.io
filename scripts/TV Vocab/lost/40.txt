always sleeps through the night   this rash somethings wrong  babies get sick   what about the fever cough  its normal   and he hasnt been eating at all  claire hes ok  its probably roseola  its a virus thats common in children his age   and the rash is a sign of it  ok what if its not  what if he caught something really bad   like some kind of infection  infection  where did you get that idea  rousseau was here   what did she say to you  she said she knew he was sick ok   that hes infected  claire there is no infection  weve been on this island for two months and no ones gotten sick  rousseaus crazy were gonna let the fever just run its course  hes gonna be fine ok trust me  im gonna get back to the hatch  but ill come back in a couple hours and check on him again ok   ok  yeah  hey im sure that if there was something wrong jack would know  are you sure about this we dont really know her  i think she can help me   hey  hey guys  so youre a shrink right  im a clinical psychologist but shrink works too  can you help people remember things  i guess it depends on what you need to remember  so it was our second week on the island  i was out in the jungle and i i thought i was having the baby  charlie was with me and there was this man ethan  we thought he was one of us from the plane but he wasnt  so he took me he took both of us  and i dont remember i dont remember anything  when jack and i found charlie he was hanging from a tree by his neck  i have no idea what happened  and now im seeing these flashes of things and  you know i have amnesia  theres two weeks missing from my life  claire i dont think you have amnesia  sometimes when something terrible happens  a little switch in your head flicks on  to protect us from having to deal with it  maybe your memories arent gone  maybe youre just blocking them  then i need you to unblock them  because my babys sick and they did something to him   do you have to go to the bathroom  no   well just let us know when you do  yeah ill look forward to that  thought you might like something to read  dostoyevsky   you dont have any stephen king  mmmm librarys a little outdated  right  well thanks  whats with the book  just something to pass the time  did you know that hemingway was jealous of dostoyevsky  no john i didnt know that  he wanted to be the worlds greatest writer  but convinced himself he could never get out  from under dostoyevskys shadow  kind of sad really  what are we doing jack   what are we doing  we cant hide him down here forever  changing shifts will make people ask questions  i just want to know what the longterm plan is  well john let me ask you this  we dont have a longterm plan for the button  but we keep pushing it dont we  look until we know who he is whether or not hes telling the truth  we have to keep doing what were doing  if youve a better idea lets hear it  how about you let me go  now were away from all the noises of the camp  just breathe  let your whole body relax  good listen to the waves  good in  and out slowly  good  keep your eyes closed  very relaxed claire  just keep breathing  now i want you to visualise yourself when you were pregnant  keep listening to my voice  think about what you see  we dont want him to get sick  when was your last checkup claire  oh i havent been in a while  ive been busy   im going to los angeles
