coincidence i just stopped being a doctor   whyd you quit  i didnt  my son ratted me out for drinking on the job thank you  lost my license  yeah i know its hilarious  no no its just that  i dont believe parents and their kids should work together  too many issues  ill drink to that   so where you headed  sydney sydney australia  you wanna come  im serious  why would i go to sydney with you  maybe fate has thrown the two of us together  you know like two drinks in an airport bar  why would fate do that  same reason fate does anything so we can help each other out  you do need help right  unless you dont  what im doing down there could be dangerous  i need someone to protect me a bodyguard  its perfect for someone who stopped being a cop  i dont even know your name  lets not use real names  ill tell you what why dont you pick a name for me  and then ill pick one for you   you look like a tom  tom what an excellent name  and you should be a  sarah  australia  what happened  i cut

 im so glad my head didnt break it  why  now thats a broad question  why did you try to hurt ana lucia but not me  im not sure i know what youre getting at  i was trapped under that blast door  helpless you couldve crushed my skull but you didnt do a thing  why didnt you  because youre one of the good ones john  what good what  none of this matters im dead anyway  the doctors gone to make a trade  we both know hell come back emptyhanded then  ive lost my value  either jack comes back and kills me  or my people find out where im being held and they do it  why would your own people want to kill you  because the man in charge  hes a great man john a brilliant man  but he is not a forgiving man  hell kill me because i failed john  i failed my mission  what mission  when that woman caught me in her trap  i was on my way here john  i was coming for you  locke  locke get out here  john  hey ive been knocking those things down for 20 minutes  get your hands off my mangoes  didnt figure you for the fruitpicking type  what do you want  i need a gun  well heres an idea why not go to your buddy jack hes got himself a gun  thats right hes still traipsing around the jungle with kate  if you got a problem because hes making time with your girlfriend  dont take it out on me man  how about you just give me a gun  heres another idea scram  you heard me now git  sarah  sarah open the damn door  good youre up  its time protection duty  come on lets go  after four days of drinking and doing nothing  now in the middle of the night youre ready  thats exactly right  its time come on fates calling sarah  this is it pull over right here  this is what you needed protection for the suburbs  just stay in the car  should i keep the meter running  look shes my daughter and i have every right to see her   no you dont get out  im coming in here   you cant stop me  get out get out of my house  i pay the mortgage on this house and you wont   i wanna see my daughter  what the hell is wrong with you  dont you ever come back here  i was just having a conversation with her  you need help   dude nice hole  what is it hurley  you remember that radio we made  i was thinking maybe i could get it to play some music you know for libby  it worked only once and then just for a minute  ive tried several times since and only gotten static  heres the thing even that would be good  libby would be like its the thought that counts  and ill score major points  especially when she sees me hold it over my head  why would you hold a staticgenerating radio over your head  they didnt have say anything in baghdad its awesome  a dude gets his boom box  holds it over his head outside a chicks window  and plays some peter gabriel song for her and bam the girls his  after her dad goes to jail but then he gets her   i think i get the idea  you should check it out sometime  i mean if we ever you know get off this island  if you want to do something nice for libby  theres a beautiful beach three kilometres from here  you could take her there  you think shed like that  i took shannon there once  michael  so it worked  what are you talking about john  your deal the trade   if they gave us michael  they didnt give us anything  so it was just a coincidence that he came wandering out  i was shouting he heard my voice  what they just let michael go  hoping we would keep up our end of the bargain  you think theyre on the honour system   hey  hey  come out come out whoever you are  i know youre there  dont make me come in after you  well well well what do we got here  was little red
