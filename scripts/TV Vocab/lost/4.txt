                help me  walt you gotta keep that dog quiet  i dont know whats wrong with him come on vincent cut that out  aw  hey sorry sorry  whats he barking at   what is it  somebodys in there   everyone in theres dead  sawyer  right behind you jackass  jack  im gonna shed some light on this thing   run get out of here  oh crud now what  come on   theyve gone  what the bloody hell was that  boars   those boars were looking to feed  we have to get rid of the bodies  bury them theres a whole bunch in there  more than 20 digging will be difficult without shovels  not bury we need to burn them   theyre people  i know theyre people kate  burning the remains they deserve better than that  better than what being eaten by wild animals thats whats gonna happen  any bodies we bury are not gonna stay buried for long  look i know this seems harsh but that fuselage in the sun  its not about what they deserve  theyre gone and were not  what you say may be true  but for us to decide how these people are laid to rest its not right  no regard for their wishes their religions  we dont have time to sort out everybodys god  last i heard we were positively made of time  im not happy about it we crashed a thousand miles off course  theyre looking in the wrong place its been four days  no ones come  tomorrow morning we need everyone to start gathering up wood dried brush  well turn that fuselage into a furnace  wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night before we set the fire  if hes so eager to burn the bodies why are we waiting till sundown  hes hoping someone will see it  looks like im not the only one who didnt sleep last night  there are better things to do with my time than collect firewood  you dont agree with jack   what are you making  too soon to talk about  im not sure if it will even work  trying to pick up the transmission the one we heard on the transceiver  if the french womans transmissions have been playing on a loop for 16 years  there must be a power source on the island  a significant one   and you can find it  hypothetically yes  im making an antenna of sorts  with a few of these mounted at different points on the island  i may be able to triangulate the signal   find out where its coming from  so what can i do to help  it appears youre as anxious to get off this island as i am  catch the ball catch the ball vincent good boy  good job vincent  hey hey where you going man  nowhere i just thought id see what mr locke was doing  hey why dont you help your dad with the wood  im sure mr locke doesnt want a kid hanging around him all day  at least he talks to me  come on vincent   whats your problem hand em over  how about no  theres other people here  if one of us wouldnt eat more than his fair share   thats bull  knock it off  youre not happy unless youre screwing   im peachy  knock it off   stay out of this metro  hey   whats going on  jethros hoarding the peanuts  my own stash i found it in there   what about the rest of the food  there is no rest of the food dude   we kinda ate it all  what  nothings left what are you talking about   okay everybody just calm down  we can find food  there are plenty of things we can use for sustenance  and exactly how are we gonna find this sustenance  we hunt  howd you get that knife on the plane  checked it  you either have very good aim  or very bad aim mr  locke his name is locke  mr locke what is it that were hunting  we know there are wild boar on the island  razorbacks by the look of them  the ones that came into the camp were piglets  a hundred 150 pounds each  which means that theres a mother nearby  a 250pound rat  with scimitarlike tusks and a surly disposition  whod love nothing more than to eviscerate anything near  a boars mode of attack is to circle and charge from behind  so it will take three to distract her long enough for me to flank a piglet  pin it and slit its throat  and you gave him his knife back  well if youve got a better idea  better than three of you wandering into the forest  to bag a hunk o ham with nothing but a little bitty hunting knife  hell no its the best idea i ever heard   who is this guy   yes  colonel is this line secure    line secure gl12 go ahead  target area is acquired   maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours  repeat we are a go   roger that well convene at the usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours  locke i told you i need those tps reports done by noon today   not 1230 not 1215 noon  i heard you the first time randy  and no personal calls during office hours colonel  so  hunting boar now huh  who says this is my first

problem staying in one place  you wanna tell me why youre really going  sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard   find the source  this isnt about boars  im a vegetarian   but why cant i come  cause i said so  hi hi excuse me  um  um  look i am going off  away to uh hunt  and i was wondering if you  if you could keep an eye  on my boy walt  and im michael  anyway
