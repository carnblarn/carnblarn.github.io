just got a job in rome with her boyfriend  they want to take walt with them  dont worry im gonna take real good care of you mr dylan  dawson  right sorry dawson  so this boyfriend this is this guy brian porter  yeah why whats it say  it seems that susan wants you to relinquish your rights as walts father   so that mr porter can adopt him  she wants me to sign my son away  its the only way they can proceed with the adoption yeah  listen if you sign this document  legally hell be no different than any other kid you pass on the street  youd be giving up your paternal rights all of them  so then can i stop her from going  well i guess we could file an injunction   so she couldnt leave the city but  yeah that that i want to do that  right  mr dawson  the fact that you came in through these doors tells me something  it tells me that im the best that you can afford  if we go forward with this its gonna take money  a lot of it even at my rates  this is david and goliath so i gotta ask you  are you sure you wanna do this  theyre not taking my son away  walt   mike you should save your energy  they took my son  yeah i saw onto a boat which means hes not in shouting distance   you dont know that  i got a good sense  even if he was theres nothing you can do  if he can hear me he knows im alive  that im coming for him that im going to get him back  right now all i got is that maybe my son can hear me   does that make any sense to you  yeah  walt  kate  kate   john  easy easy easy  behind you  are you him  are you him  jin  jin  i thought we had to save our energy  yeah well jins still out there in the water  so if its ok by you im gonna keep shoutin awhile   feeling guilty  what  you made me fire that flare  i made you fire  what this is my fault  they took my son  they found us took walt because you made me fire the flare  well at least walt is on a boat probably wrapped in a blanket   with a cup of cocoa while were on  get off my raft   what  get  what the hell was that  i see you managed to hold on to your best friend there  thing aint gonna work anyway   itll work  you were underwater  what do you know about guns anyway hoss ltll work  if the bullets are dry the powders dry if the powders  what the hell is that  its a shark  its only a shark  its only a shark thats supposed to make me feel better  well i guess i know why the shark is hanging around your shoulder  oh well ill just stop bleeding then  you suddenly forget what happened why i got shot   what  how about a little gratitude here  i mean how about thank you  thank you for what for you trying to save your own ass  you want me off this raft you got it  i was trying to save your damn kid  lets talk about walt shall we mr dawson  sure ok  when was the last time you actually saw your son   about a year ago  it was fourteen months actually   is that a question lizzy  why is that mr dawson   why so long  susan took him to amsterdam for work   you didnt have a problem with that  excuse me  well since shes now going to rome and youre filing an injunction   it just seems a little inconsistent  incon no   no no no no no  dont  she took him though i didnt want her to go   you said there was nothing i could do  and you didnt did you   hes not gonna answer that  because there is no answer  you were in an accident recently  yeah  you had several surgeries spent weeks in a private hospital room  extensive rehabilitation   who paid for all that mr dawson  i didnt ask you for anything  could the record reflect mr dawson acknowledged miss lloyd paid his bills  susan tell them that i didnt ask you  please dont address my client directly  do you know what walts first words were mr dawson   im sorry what  his first words  do you know what they were  i  no i i wasnt there  do you know what his favourite food is   do you  no  ok this is unnecessary  no  well for someone who wants to retain his paternal rights so badly  you dont seem to know much about your son mr dawson  im his father  im sorry could you say that louder please just for the record  im his father  are you crazy you gonna take the bullet out with your bare hands  you got a better idea  then go to hell  never gonna be able to do it by yourself   i thought we parted ways  were caught in the same current  hes still talking  come on  you got a bandaid  are you are you him  yes  yes i am  i cant believe it youre finally here  well here i am  whos she  shes with me  what did one snowman say to the other snowman  i dont know what youre talking about  get rid of the knife youre not him   we didnt come

jungle  you found it  yeah be careful  be careful with it here hey take aaron  come here there you go  you gotta be careful with it you know its the virgin mary shes holy  i didnt realise you were so religious  im not its just you know it might come in handy  be a nice thing to have around  it wasnt the flare  i said it wasnt the flare  those people that did this  at first i thought they were fishermen or pirates or something  then i got a good look at their boat  you know anything about boats mike  boat like that wasnt built for the open ocean  waters coming over the side the first little squall  maybe got a range of a hundred miles  nope a boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close  like the island  french chick said the others were coming for the kid  i think they came mike   what  hes the one they wanted  why i got a bullet in my shoulder  hell bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid   you saying this is my fault  yeah thats what im sayin  they took him because of you they were sailing away  they found us because they were looking for us for walt   dont ever say his name again ever  what you gonna do splash me   look i know  shut up  dont even  you have no idea what its like to care for somebody else  hi   where are your lawyers  i told them i wanted to talk  just you and me   but if you want yours i understand  no its ok  i think youre gonna win  excuse me  in court i think youre going to keep me from leaving the country with walt  but i just have to ask you why   why what  why are you doing this   hes my son  since when michael  look i know you dont care about whats best for me  but in rome ill be a senior partner at the firm  ill be able to give walt anything he needs  youre still on disability michael you cant work  youre about to be evicted   got your lawyers checking up on me  of course i did  just like you had your lawyers check up on me nobodys winning  then stop  michael the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself  you need to get healthy you need to get back on your feet financially  so you can get back to pursuing your art  you have rare talent as an artist michael  but how are you going to do that
