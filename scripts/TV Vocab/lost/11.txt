                previously on lost  i think i think im all right   i told you id take care of you  thanks  youre quite welcome   listen to me  sayid  were not alone  i was sleeping and i woke up  and he was trying to hurt my baby   we gotta find out who everyone is  a census   lance  sorry   your names lance  ethan  dude thats right  i want you to take these theyre very mild  you think im making this up  it was safe at the beach its not safe here   what did you say  we got a problem  the census i interviewed everyone  one isnt in the manifest he wasnt on the plane  ethan   who wasnt on the plane  ethan  hes not on the passenger manifest   where is he  i saw him yesterday   has anyone seen ethan  yeah he went to get some wood  took off on the path to the beach is he okay what happened   wheres charlie  what  wheres charlie  he went after claire  jack  she was moving back to the beach  claire thats hers  what happened where are they  i dont know  footprints  at least three distinct sets all over the place  it looks like there might have been a struggle  what what is it  drag marks here and here  claire and charlie they were together  i think theyve been taken  claire charlie  jack jack  shh  the tracks are still fresh  this doesnt make any sense  how could one man drag two people one pregnant  youre asking the wrong question not how why   you think it was ethan  feels like it was ethan  by himself how  we cant account for all of our people  and more importantly whos to say theyre even our people   what  sayid said there were others   sayid said were not alone  semantics  sayids injured we dont even know where he went   this is what the ground is telling me  so which way  jack we dont know whats going on here   we know enough  we need to prepare  we could be back at the caves organize a search party  which way did they go locke   stats are dropping  come on   shes bleeding  got the artery almost there   arrest  one milligram epi lets get the crash cart  all right arterys sealed close her up   charged  charged  clear   charged  were charged  clear  come on  come on back now  come on now come on back  come on  call it  come on baby come back come on baby  come on now you can do this  come on  call it jack  its over call it  you call it  you let him go alone  dont worry ill catch up  whats the word from the beach  nothing nobody has seen him   im coming with you  i figured you might  what are you doing  we need to get back to the beach  youre forming a search party can i help  its an island theres no choppers  how exactly are you gonna find them  by following ethans trail  no one can walk without leaving signs bending grass  breaking twigs especially with captives in tow  and yes i could use another hand if youre up for it   im up for it  then lets get moving  i could take vincent he can sniff something that belonged to charlie   and i can help  i said no man  hey locke  a lot of us dont wanna sit here waiting for news  thanks but were set   anyone else is gonna slow us down  okay  maybe ill just put together another party  good idea  were going north you go south  come on  never thought id see the day jack  you barge into my or you work on my patient   you didnt have to do this  i dont have to do anything  yeah of course you dont  i chose to do this procedure  this emergency procedure because when this girl crashed in the er   they called me  i was right upstairs  you shouldve stayed how did you find out  one of the nurses came to get me  who  oh thank god i have you  and some anonymous nurse to rescue me  she told me your hands were shaking   my hands were not  you cut her artery  she was in a car crash jack her insides were a mess   they called me  you made a mistake  i dont care whether they called you you made a mistake  are you lecturing me you tell me if you were upstairs  and i was in a restaurant having lunch then why did they call me  how many drinks did you have at lunch dad  jack  jack  good thing you were going in a circle  not much of a search grid but we never would have found you otherwise  did you find anything  no  you should go back to the caves sayids leg  i dressed sayids leg you found me  we can find charlie and claire do we have a trail   jack this was my fault  what  i hunted with ethan i spent time with him i never sensed anything  off for everything i know about hunting and tracking  whoever he is he knows more  if we catch him i dont want anything to happen  to the only physician on the island so go back be the doctor  let me be the hunter  can we go now  follow me  im trying to help and the guy tells me go south  like what im gonna get in his way or something  were all tweaked lockes feeling it like the rest of us  i got five guys who are going with me  putting our necks on the line to find charlie and claire  im saying im sick of being treated  like a secondclass citizen around here  because mount baldy can bag a boar  he knows a lot more than how to catch a boar  mr lockes a warrior he can hunt  he can track stuff and hes the only one who brought knives  so if it were me id listen to him  well i dont want you to  you understand  you stay with hurley  i might not be a warrior  but i am going south  back home  im known as something of a warrior myself  we mark our progress by line of sight  tie these off so we dont get lost  you can lead us back to camp right  if nothing happens to me  maybe id better take marker detail   anything  not yet   if you cant find the trail  ill pick it up again  we need to rest get our clarity back  youre gonna take a break its gotta be almost 400   when the sun sets  its 425  and yes im taking a break  can i talk to you for a sec  would it kill you to give the guy a little space  it might   stop that  what  that  whats going on  i didnt believe her   claire i gave her a sedative  jack  she told me someone was after her she was being attacked and i  she just seemed so out of it  i thought that her pregnancy was amping up her stress and i  i didnt believe her  jack  what is it   look familiar  its charlies  you think it just came off  no  hes leaving us a trail  they went this way  im not so sure  theres another trail here   what do you mean  these are footprints  people moved off this way  charlies leaving these for us they went that way  unless charlie isnt the one leaving them  if ethan knows were behind him he could be setting up a dummy trail  take off in one direction double back in his own footprints   wait now youre a tracker  youre just full of surprises  so weve got two trails lets split up ill take that one  we should stay together  why weve got two trails and apparently two trackers  be careful   who got taken by what  charlie and claire   they think ethan took em  ethan took em  yeah  took em why and who the hells ethan  i dont know he wasnt on the list thing the manifest  ever think he might have lied about his name  its stupid to lie about your name  all righty tattoo where do you think ethan came from  maybe he was already on the island before we were  got yourself one hell of an imagination kid  there could be lots of other people  so a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp  to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from vh1 hasbeens  yeah fiendishly clever  and why am i getting the news from a 6yearold   im 10  okay then it must be true  if you dont believe me ask sayid he said were not alone  sayids back  red shirt  huh  red shirt  you ever watch star trek   oh not really  the crew guys that would go down to the planet with the main guys  the captain and the guy with the pointy ears  they always wore red shirts and they always got killed   yeah  yeah  sounds like a pisspoor captain  what do you do in the real world mr locke   its john  john  why dont you guess  youre either a taxidermist or a hit man  i was a  regional collections supervisor for a box company  a box company  they made boxes  yeah right   please slow down  you said they went this way  i think they went this way im not as good at this as locke is  so whered you pick up the tracking skills kate  was that before or after you were on the run   im trying to help  you know what might help  a little honesty just give me something real anything  my dad was in the army ranger battalion  he was stationed at fort lewis washington state  wed go hiking together  one day we spent eight hours tracking deer  being in the woods it was like  it was like his religion  that was real  anything you wanna share  well thanks for coming in jack have a seat   whats it say  the truth  a patient was brought to the er following a car accident  rushed into surgery with internal bleeding  you joined me and in spite of our most heroic efforts  the patient succumbed to her injuries  looks like you fixed everything but the patient  you had no business being in or  you think i would have walked in there   if i couldnt handle it  youve done it before  thats right because i am capable of making those  how can you say that after what happened   the problem is not  you were impaired  i know my limits   i wont sign this  you were part of a team jack  im not the only one on the hook  you called me off  you were the surgeon of record when she died  look accidents happen in surgeries all the time  thats the truth and you know it  but if you contradict this report  if you mention alcohol  well thats the only fact thats gonna matter  theyll strip me of my license  yes  they will  i know i have been hard on you  but that is how you make a soft metal into steel  that is why you are  the most gifted young surgeon in this city  i mean this this is a career  that is all about the greater good  ive had to sacrifice  certain aspects of my relationship with you  so that hundreds and thousands of patients will live  because of your extraordinary skills  i know its a long  long time coming  what happened yesterday  i promise you  will never happen again  after all that ive given  this isnt this is not just about my career jack  its my life  thank you son thank you  well well well  i dont know if you islams got a concept of karma  but i get the sense this island just served you up a platter  of cosmic payback   what do you want  dr doright doesnt trust me  with his antibiotics so i gotta hump it up here every day to get my meds  you know a less magnanimous man than i  might be thinking he could beat the living snot out of you   without fear of reprisal  you want a shot take it  know that i left this camp out of shame for what i did to you  it was never my intention to return  sorry fresh out of sweet forgiveness  if it wasnt your intention to return then why did you  i was taken prisoner by the french woman  one whos sending out a distress signal for 16 years   shes alive  she was on a science expedition   she said they shipwrecked  she alone  she said that there are others on this island   her people  no  she believed they had all gotten sick  she murdered her entire team  right   these others who are they  i dont know   shes never seen them  shes never seen them   but she knows theyre there  if you believe her  do you  maybe  maybe not  but on my way back  i heard something in the jungle   surrounding me  something like what  have you got something to say to me sawyer  or are you going to ask me questions  you know i dont have the answers to  tides coming up the beach  the plane hulls almost in the water  i kept your signal fire burning   crap  your blots cant get in  i know my blots cant get in   my roll  yahoo  i need a fourthree  dude would you please roll   yes  no  your turn  its okay i wasnt good when i started playing either  i didnt just start playing  i took 17th in a tournament once   no 17th is very good

subsidiaries  so whos running it now  i guess it doesnt matter does it  im sure there are people who can handle it temporarily  its gonna start raining in one minute   one minute  give or take a few seconds   you should head back  what  trails been cold dangerous terrain ahead  youll make it back before dark   and you  i take care of myself   no  i admire your courage  im not heading back  all

  no no he was here  you have to stop  the rain has washed away the trail even if he was here youve got   im not letting him do this  not letting him  not again  she had massive internal hemorrhaging  we realized that her blood pressure was continuing to drop precipitously  at which point the patient went into cardiac arrest  of course every effort was made to resuscitate her  but the severity of her injuries  the amount of internal bleeding  made that impossible  in my professional opinion ladies and gentlemen  and thats all i have  by the time i was called in  the damage was irreversible  okay thanks christian   sorry about this formality  of course  just one final detail you were aware of the patients pregnancy   when you went into the procedure  absolutely  the patients husband had informed the attending in the er  it was however extremely early in the pregnancy  so our primary focus had to be on the mother  okay i think were done here our final report will be filed  okay  i need to   revise my statement  i didnt come in until well into the procedure  jack  i was warned by one of the nurses  that my father was operating  under the influence  jack this is not  by the time i got there it was clear my father  was not only incapacitated but that he had also  severed the patients hepatic artery  which in my professional opinion  caused the crisis which led to her death  no  we gotta cut him down  hold on charlie hold on there  i cant reach  pull him over  harder  hes not breathing  come on breathe  breathe charlie come on  breathe  come on  come on  come on  come on
