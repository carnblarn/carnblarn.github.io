runnin out the jungle  hurry hurry come with me  he brings me down here  first thing he does cos its beeping  he types in the code pushes the button and it stops  what was all that about i say  just saving the world he says   saving the world  his words not mine  so i started pushing the button too  and we saved the world together for a while and that was lovely  then kelvin died and now here i am all alone  the end  dont tell me you believe this this is crazy  you think that makes sense pushing a button   youre going to take his word for it  his word is all we have jack  you dont have to take my word for it watch the film   what  the bookcase top shelf  behind turn of the screw projectors in the pantry  here  dude i gotta say i didnt think we were gonna get through the night  and i

sick   you didnt ask anything about him  he was the one with the gun  you seem calm for someone who believes the worlds going to end in 45 minutes  hell fix it  you understand that what hes saying its insane its impossible  why is it insane  the last time i saw the computer that would save the world  it didnt look like that  is the reason youre so upset because he said he recognised you  because that would be impossible  welcome im dr marvin candle and this is the orientation film  for station three of the dharma initiative  in a moment youll be given a simple set of instructions  for how you and your partner will fulfil the responsibilities  associated with this station but first a little history  the dharma initiative was created in 1970  and is the brainchild of gerald and karen degroot  two doctoral candidates at the university of michigan  following in the footsteps of visionaries such as bf skinner   imagined a largescale communal research compound  where scientists and freethinkers from around the globe could pursue research  in meteorology psychology parapsychology zoology  electromagnetism and utopian social   reclusive danish industrialist and munitions magnate alvar hanso  whose financial backing made their dream  of a multipurpose social science research facility a reality  you and your partner are currently located in station three or the swan  and will be for the next 540 days  station three was originally constructed as a laboratory  where scientists could work to understand  the unique electromagnetic fluctuations  emanating from this sector of the island  not long after the experiments began however there was an incident  since that time the following protocol has been observed  every 108 minutes the button must be pushed  from the moment the alarm sounds  you will have four minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor   induction into the programme  when the alarm sounds either you or your partner must input the code  it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts  in this manner you will both stay as fresh and alert   utmost importance that when the alarm sounds  the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion  do not attempt to use the computer for anything  congratulations  until your replacements arrive the future of the project is in your hands  on behalf of the degroots alvar hanso  and all of us at the dharma initiative  thank you namaste and good luck  were gonna need to watch that again  whats that  its a present its been six months sort of an anniversary right   i didnt get you anything  thats ok  only cost me a buck  its to my place thought you might be tired of knocking  well helen i  i dont know what to say  theres just one condition though john  when you stay over you stay over  what do you mean  i followed you last night  to that house that you go to  is it your fathers house  why would you follow me helen why would you do that  you sneak

would get over it but i i couldnt do it alone  i needed to find help  you help me john  and i can help you  you just have to promise me that youre not gonna go to that place anymore  all right  all

died waiting for his replacements  so you dont get out you dont see anyone wheres your food come from   you really think this is happening  why wouldnt it be  it says quarantine on the inside of the hatch to keep you down here  keep you scared but you know what  weve been up there for over 40 days and no ones gotten sick  you think this is the only part of it thats true  did you ever think they put you here to push a button every 100 minutes  just to see if you would that the computer the button  its just a mind game an experiment  every single day  and for all our sakes i hope its not real  but the film says this is an electromagnetic station  and i dunno about you brother  but every time i walk past that concrete wall out there my fillings hurt  right  oh no  what happened  its over  what do you mean its over  what are you doing are you leaving  desmond wait  we can fix the computer sayid is coming he knows  give him my best  wait wait where are you you cant leave  where are you
