forget it  i didnt hear anything  what are you so afraid of  youre the one trembling sweetness  okay this is really awkward  but if i dont say something now  things are liable to get downright embarrassing   hibbs  hello sawyer  maam i must apologize  i figured my good friend sawyer here would be alone  i just need a few minutes   listen baby  baby who is this  listen you go down to the bar

right  besides we both know you aint the killing type  here  figure that makes us even for the tampa job  what could possibly make us even for the tampa job  how about the known whereabouts of the man who ruined your life  im gonna make myself a drink you want one  you remember old man parks right  ran capper for us on that gig in atlanta  yeah what about him  hes been working at an offtrack parlor in sydney  so last week one of his regulars  gets too sauced runs his mouth off about his glory days as a grifter  that guy frank duckett  hardluck case gambling addict alcoholic  runs a shrimp truck  back in the day this guy duckett was quite the hustler  he ran the romance angle  hook the wife take the husband for the money  was pretty good at it too from what i hear  until sadly one of his marks in despair  took a gun shot up his wife and blew his own head off  all in front of their little boy  i paid tony to pull his jacket  turns out frank duckett used to be named frank sawyer  a name i believe you appropriated for yourself  this is him  thats him  thanks for the loaner  always a pleasure  is anyone curious where they came from  they knew there was a marshal they assumed he was traveling alone  protecting them from terrorists  sounds like a good theory to me   did you get all the guns back  all except one  who  how about i give you three guesses  sawyer i can get it back  really  how are you gonna do that  i speak his language  youve done this before and if i remember it right  you made out with him  and he never even had what you said you could get  well i only made out with him because torturing him didnt work  let him keep the gun its not worth it  worried hes gonna shoot me if i ask  i just dont want you to owe him anything   hey  hi  how you feeling  very pregnant  l um had some dreams last night  actually more like memories  you were in them  sorry  thought id see if you wanted to go for a walk  sorry  i have to  do something  sure  see you later okay  itll come back around   son of a bitch  a boar did all this  last night it wrecked my tent  this morning when i went to get my tent back  it attacks me from behind  runs off into the jungle like a coward  a boar wouldnt just attack you for no reason  thank you boar expert  this one did  its harassing me  what are you doing   getting even  would you listen to yourself  its a boar  just go tell locke and hell kill it   nope this is my fight  do you know about hunting boar  you are gonna get yourself lost or worse   since when do you care  i dont  good then if youll excuse me ive got some revenge to tend to  you must be hibbss mate  i did a few jobs with hibbs back in the states   nice enough fella  hes a son of a bitch  right indeed he is  a few disclaimers  australia doesnt allow its citizens to carry handguns  you get nicked with this  im not gonna rat you out  secondly you know ive been doing this for a while  and a man who buys a compact357 with hollowpoint loads  hes not looking to scare or steal  hes looking to kill when it comes down to it  if he finds he doesnt have what it takes to do the job  your sales pitch needs some work  what im saying is  you look a man in the eye and point a gun at him  you find who you really are  and should you find youre not a killer  theres no refund  wont be a problem  hurley i appreciate the help  but you dont have to  i killed ethan i can bury him  yeah until he rises from the dead  dude i know how this works this is gonna end  with you and me running through the jungle screaming and crying  he catches me first because im heavy and i get cramps  are you all right  yo sayid  can i ask you a question  of course  did you ever get that gulf war syndrome   that was the other side  oh right  then whats the one when youre all shellshocked   posttraumatic stress disorder  yeah did you ever have that  why do you ask   im worried about charlie  whats wrong with charlie  i mean he killed a guy he shot him in the chest four times  maybe you should talk to him  its a footprint  based on the weight and the distance between strides  id say youve been following boone for an hour   look  could be charlie i suppose  im tickled you have an interest in my affairs  i really am  dont take it personal when i tell you to  i want carte blanche   what  its simple  you cant track this boar without help  over the last few hours you have managed to follow the tracks  of humans birds a rock slide yourself  basically everything except boar  you have no idea what youre doing   carte blanche  blank check   i know what it means  anytime i want something from you  medicine soap whatever i get it no questions asked  take it or leave it  all right  you got a deal   whered you get that  the plane  jack was looking for the liquor cart  its a good thing i found it instead then   got any more of those  i got a lot more of everything  but you aint got carte blanche yet  is that a no  all right sassafras  but if you want a drink you gotta play   play what  i never  what  i never  am i supposed to know what that means  call it a way to get to know each other better  for example   i know youve never been to college  and how do you know that  if you had youd have heard of i never  its simple  you say i never and then you finish the sentence  if its something you did you drink  if its something you never did you dont drink  that makes absolutely no sense  learn by example  i never kissed a man  now you drink  cause youve kissed a man  your turn  i never implied that ive been to college  when i never have  i never been to disneyland  oh thats just sad  i never wore pink  i knew it   the 80s  mmhmm  i never voted democrat  i never voted  ive never been in love   youve never been in love  i aint drinking am i  ive never had a onenight stand  bottoms up sailor   i gotta drink for each one  your turn  i never been married  it didnt last very long  ive never blamed a boar for all my problems  i never cared about having carte blanche  cause i just wanted to spend some time  with the only other person on this island that just dont belong  i never carried a letter around for 20 years  because i couldnt get over my baggage  i never killed a man  well  it looks like we got something in common after all  itll come back around   are you okay  youre shaking  im fine  i was just having a  i cant believe this  there are hoof marks everywhere  it ate all our stuff  nope it ate your stuff mines fine  oh that hog is gonna suffer  i swear to god  morning  what happened to your campsite  what are you doing all the way out here   looking for salvage from the crash  find anything useful  the occasional scrap of metal a few bags of coffee  i picked up your path a mile back i thought id say howdy  oh son of a oh  peed on my shirt took my shirt out of the bag  and peed on it and you say this aint personal  he thinks the boar were after has a vendetta against him   uhhuh  thats three times its attacked me  maybe its got your scent doesnt like your cologne   i dont wear cologne  yes you do  yeah well   the things got it in for me  its a boar sawyer  my sister jeannie died when i was a boy  she fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck  and my mother well my foster mother  she blamed herself of course  thought she wasnt watching close enough  so she stopped eating stopped sleeping  the neighbors started talking  afraid she might do something to herself i guess  ooh thats good  anyway about six months after jeannies funeral  this golden retriever comes up our driveway  walks right into our house sits down on the floor  and looks right at my mother there on the couch  and my mother looks back at the dog  after about a minute of this them staring at each other like that  my mother burst into tears  beautiful dog no tags no collar  healthy and sweet  the dog slept in jeannies old room on jeannies old bed  and stayed with us until my mother passed five years later  then disappeared back to  wherever it was she came from in the first place  so youre saying the dog was your sister  well that would be silly  but my mother thought it was  thought that jeannie had come back to tell her  the accident wasnt her fault  let her off the hook  good to go  only two choices  shrimp in mild sauce shrimp in hot sauce  pal  ill go with the hot  hot it is  ah a fellow american huh  good for you you
