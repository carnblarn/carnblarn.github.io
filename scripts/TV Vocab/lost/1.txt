of an odd thing  when i was in residency my first solo procedure  was a spinal surgery on a 16yearold kid a girl  and at the end after 13 hours i was closing her up and i  i accidentally ripped her dural sack  its at the base of the spine where all the nerves come together  membrane as thin as tissue and  so it ripped open  nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta  spinal fluid flowing out of her and i  the terror was just so  crazy so real  and i knew i had to deal with it  so i just made a choice  id let the fear in let it take over let it do its thing  but only for five seconds thats all i was gonna give it  so i started to count  one two  three four five  and it was gone  i went back to work sewed her up and she was fine  if that had been me i think i wouldve run for the door  no i dont think thats true  youre not running now  you think they would have come by now  hmm   who  anyone  as if im gonna start eating chocolate   shannon we may be here for a while  the plane had a black box idiot  they know exactly where we are theyre coming  ill eat on the rescue boat  ill eat on the rescue boat   hungry  yeah thanks  any more you know baby stuff  no im okay   well hang in there  yeah you too  you sure youre warm enough  do you think hes gonna live  do you know him  he was sitting next to me  we mustve been at about  we hit an air pocket and dropped  maybe 200 feet  the turbulence was  i blacked out  i didnt  i saw the whole thing  i knew that the tail was gone but i  couldnt bring myself to look back  and then the front end of the plane broke off  well its not here on the beach  neither is the tail  we need to figure out which way we came in   why  theres a chance we find the cockpit  if its intact we might be able to find the transceiver  we could send out a signal help the rescue party find us  how do you know all that  i took a couple of flying lessons  wasnt for me  i saw some smoke  just through the valley  if youre thinking about going for the cockpit im going with you  i dont know your name  im kate  jack  what was that   that was weird right  is that vincent  its not vincent  did anybody see that  yeah   boone  terrific  so hows the drink   its good  that wasnt a very strong reaction  well its not a very strong drink  just dont tell anyone  this of course breaks some critical faa regulations  excuse me   sir excuse me  guess he really had to go  sir excuse me  the pilot has switched on the fasten seatbelts sign   please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts   its normal  oh i know ive just never been a very good flier  my husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air  well he sounds like a very smart man  be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom  well ill keep you company until he does  dont worry its gonna be over  it didnt sound like an animal not exactly  i keep thinking there was something familiar about it   where you from  bronx   monkeys  monkey island  dont know if were on an island  you ready  you showed me where the smoke was i can get there myself  im coming  well youre gonna need better shoes  whatever it was it wasnt natural   does anyone have any sunblock  yeah i do  so i was just looking inside the fuselage  its pretty grim in there  you think we should do something about the  b odys   what are you spelling man bodies  bodles  that sounds like a good idea  no theyll deal with it when they get here  im gonna go out and look for the cockpit  see if we can find a transceiver to send a distress signal help the rescue team  see if we can find a transceiver to send a distress signal help the rescue team  you need to keep an eye on the wounded  if the guy in the suit wakes up keep him calm  but dont let him remove that shrapnel
