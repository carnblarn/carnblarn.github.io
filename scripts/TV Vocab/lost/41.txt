figure out if this mans telling the truth  does jack know youre coming to me with this  we got a serious problem ana lucia  all of us  im taking the necessary steps to solve it  i dont need jacks permission  right now theres a man sitting in a room in my hatch  and i want him out  i dont wanna give you anything  its the thought that counts and you didnt think  i think all the time maybe you

maam  dont pay him any mind honey  hes just mad at the world because he forgot my birthday  i didnt forget i dont even know what day of the week it is  its saturday bernard   honey can you walk  really im all right   maybe we should go get jin  no  i think i was just out in the sun too long  you spend time around the baby maybe you caught something   at least talk to jack  really im ok  thank you both of you  in english  iii  i would like an iced tea please   very good  thank you  morning jack  you couldnt wait until i was done  the steam opens up my pores  mans got no shaving cream hes got to improvise  i also thought this might be a good time to talk about our problem   our problem  our henry problem  weve had him locked up for three days  i get the sense that hes just not motivated to cooperate with us  and how are we gonna motivate him john  theres nothing we can do we need to bring in some new blood  obviously you have someone in mind  what do you think about ana lucia  why her  you went to her to start an army to fight these people  why not her  unless youre worried about what shell do to him   ill talk to her  i already did  in there with him now  were you on the plane too  i was in the tail section  we crashed on the other side of the island  you walked across all the way here  that must have been fun  it had its moments  you gonna tell me your story henry  why ive told it to everyone  jack locke the big black guy that cut off his beard in front of me  oh yeah and my buddy sayid   you see how much he liked my story  so how about you try me  i dont mean to be ungrateful but why are you gonna help me get out of here  on the other side of the island there was this guy with us  i was 100 convinced that he wasnt on the plane  so i dug a hole and i threw him in it  and what happened  i was wrong and now hes dead  but good news for you henry i dont make the same mistake twice  so how about you tell me your story  sawyer  well hey there sunshine what can i do for you  hows your book  predictable not nearly enough sex  i heard that you have all the medical supplies   you heard correct  may i look through them  no you may not but if youll tell me what youre looking for  forget it  ok hold on  now im intrigued  tell you what tell me what youre looking for and its yours gratis  cant i just look myself  its not a drugstore sweetheart  i need  a pregnancy test   i cant hear anything  shes only been in there 30 minutes  he might have snapped her neck  how do you know she hasnt snapped his  so you and your wife travel around the world  and crash here in a smileyface balloon  then she dies you get captured by a french chick who brings you here  and then they lock you up  sounds silly when you say it like that   why dont you have a beard  because i shaved  because i needed something normal  ok so why dont you draw me a map to your balloon  well go there find it and everybodyll believe you  they all keep asking me to draw a map  if i mess up theyll crucify me  you flew around the world in a balloon  and you dont think you can draw a map  air travel its a different animal its about wind currents  do you or do you not know where it is  yeah i know where it is  i went back there to bury my wife  whyd you do that  because that balloon was the closest thing we had to home  you people have been looking for someone to punish  for everything thats happened someone to blame  and now youve got him  it doesnt matter what i do im dead already  you draw up that map henry  ill find your balloon  but if you dont  things are gonna play out just like you said  hey sun  look what i found in the jungle  its not even melted or nothing crazy huh  dyou wanna split it  no no thank you  i was just heading to the beach  ok well later dude  coming out  he told me the same story he told you   believe him  i dont know yet  i need more time with him   hes all yours  tomorrow  i wanna give him some time to think  if thats ok with you  i didnt tell anyone ana  no worries man  bit large for a diningroom table  if we cut them in two it will suit the purpose  sayid can i talk to you  of course  alone  whatever you need to say you can say it here   its about the hatch  the guy locked in the closet there  what about him  its to his balloon   how did you get him to do this  i asked nicely  do jack and locke know about this  jack and locke are a little too busy worrying about locke and jack  all i wanna know is if this guys telling the truth  why come to me  judging from what you did to his face thats what you want too  this is at least a days walk  then we should get going   you ok  fine thanks  that cliff there appears to be this  score one for henry  pointing out a touchstone does not mean hes leading us to a balloon  maybe not but at least were on the right island  humours not his strong suit  and im saying this to you   you looking at my bum  no im looking at your gun  my what  maybe you should give the gun to somebody who knows how to use it  maybe i will as i recall the last time you had a gun you murdered someone  thats enough  well go as far as the base of the cliff and well camp there   how long is it supposed to take  up to two minutes   im sorry im just  i know  where did sawyer find one of these anyway  i mean who flies with a pregnancy test right  have you ever taken one  yeah  thank you for waiting with me  and not asking why youre here and not jin  youre welcome  its time  youre pregnant  is it 100 sure  theres only one way to find out  these tests are pretty accurate  a false negative in the first week maybe but a positive is a positive   but its impossible  oh no its possible  are you feeling queasy lightheaded  please jack this is private  nobody can know   youre not gonna tell jin  in time i will its just  its complicated  as complicated as jin being the last one here to find out you spoke english  sun my advice and its just that  because im the last person to ask about this but you should tell him  and when you do you should tell him everything the whole truth  ive gotta get back to the hatch congratulations sun  youve been down there a lot jack  is everything ok  sure yeah everythings fine  you ok  sun  sun  sun  sun are you all right  yes im fine  you were distracted for our entire lesson youre not fine  we  jin and i went to see a doctor  he said i cannot have children  im very sorry sun  i was glad  im not saying you should stay for jin  you mind  you should sleep while you can  yeah i cant sleep  people dont like me  ive tried to get them to most of my life but  i guess i just gave up a while back  i mean  i am what i am  but you youve got a good reason to hate me  im sorry  im sorry for what i did  you were trying to protect your people  it wasnt you that killed shannon it was them  and once we find out he is one of them  then something will have to be done  what  nothing  its gonna rain   we should get moving  morning who wants breakfast  i have papayas and papayas  lets go  right why eat  this is it  this balloon it would be rather large right  why am i not surprised   we need to look some more  this is where he said it would be  if im gonna back your play on this sayid we need to be sure  ill divide the area into three grids  well search as thoroughly as you please  oh for the love of god  no no no no its not for fish no no no  oysters  oyster  pearl for rose pearl  no oyster no oyster here  of course not why would there be  yo daddyo   sawyer  way to go papasan  you didnt waste much time  id give you a cigar but im fresh out   suns pregnant  keep it down there suzy  i dont think jin senior here knows yet  daddyo  i love you  how is it  men reject their prophets and slay them  but they love their martyrs and honour those whom they have slain  so whats the difference between a martyr and a prophet  either way it sounds like you end up dead  thats the spirit  you in the mood for some breakfast   whats the computer for  nothing  cereal  wow whered you guys get cereal  it was down here all along pantrys full of food  how old is it  you guys dont know much huh  id be asking all kinds of questions about all this stuff down here  you guys dont seem that curious  do you want the cereal or dont you  this must be my reward for good behaviour  i guess i earned myself goodwill for finally drawing that map for ana  what map  to my balloon   did you  no  wow you guys have some real trust issues dont you  i guess it makes sense she didnt tell you  with the two of you fighting all the time  of course if i was one of them  these people that you seem to think are your enemies  what would i do  well thered be no balloon  so id draw a map to a real secluded place  like a cave or some underbrush  a good place for a trap  an ambush  and when your friends got there a bunch of my peopled be waiting for them  and then theyd use them to trade for me  i guess its a good thing im not one of them huh  you guys got any milk
