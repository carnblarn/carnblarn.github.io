did you tell locke you gave me a statue from the plane  why would i do that  he knows man that bald wanker knows something  is something wrong  apart from me losing my mind no everythings peachy  why would you say you are losing your mind  how about the fact that ive been sleepwalking  stealing babies from their cribs  and the vivid dreams that make me feel like im awake  until of course i wake up  what are your dreams about  variations of aaron being in mortal peril  trapped in a piano  drifting out to sea  theres the flying dove and claire and my mum dressed as angels  telling me i need to save the baby  what  have you ever considered that these dreams mean something  like what  what if you do need to save the baby   i have to talk to her  nows not a good time   shell wanna hear this  tell me and i will tell her   not now  please aarons in danger   what  the babys in danger  ive been having these dreams i know what they mean now  we have to baptise aaron   what  we can do this ekos a priest   its time to go  wait we have to baptise aaron  hes in danger weve got to do this  here for when it rains  thanks  when are you gonna tell me what happened in the jungle  i already did pull it tighter or itll sag  you told me what that guy said  you didnt tell me what made you turn around  what made you come back  he had a gun at kates head  you hitting that   what  plane crash you both survived  nice beach shes hot youre hot  thats what people do  im not hitting that  hey  karen kicked me out man  what  what happened  she thinks im dangerous  why would she think that  because i dropped her i dropped megan  liam its all right  weve got no money weve got nothing   what are we gonna do  well get through this  yeah hows that  im writing again  i got a new song its about two brothers   who shouldve been butchers  dont say that this is a good one  i feel like this might be the one listen to this  nice man   this could work  its good right  we could make it work write all night just like the old days  so baby brother  you got any  im disappointed in you   you followed me  how long you been coming out here  youve got the wrong idea man  you said you destroyed them and yet here they are  i came to finish the job to get rid of these  very convenient now that ive found them  what are you doing  there was a time when i let you choose  whether or not you were gonna do this to yourself   now im making that choice for you  you dont believe me  give them to me right now ill destroy them  ill throw them in the sodding wind  i know i lied just wait  remember all those talks we had you and me  you said everything happens for a reason  this island tests us  thats what this is this is my test thats why these are here  these are here because you put them here  wait  what are you gonna do are you gonna tell claire  you cant if she sees them im done  shell never trust me again and she has to  its about the baby aarons in danger  you have to believe me  youve given up the right to be believed  hey  hi   hows our boy  hes good   can i ask you something  sure  do you think aaron and i  could stay in the bedroom in the hatch for a while  alarm goes off every hour and a half  its not the best place for a baby to sleep through the night  yeah sure  how about if i move my stuff down here set up right next to your tent  thatd be great thanks  then consider it done  you dont know anything about baptism do you  not a whole lot why  charlie came by my tent before  he told me aaron had to be baptised  that he was in danger  my understanding is baptism is about making sure children get into heaven  should anything happen  call it spiritual insurance  there isnt any danger charlie just  charlie just feels like he has to save the baby  because he cant save himself   ill see you tonight  ok  charlie can you give us a hand  nows not a good time sayid  lets lift this  i got it   fire  where  grab tools containers for sand anything you have  if we dont stop it now itll burn right through the camp  stay here with aaron  we need to cut a fire break right here form a bucket line  some of you people down to the water  sawyer  youre heading them off right

clinic in sydney  i just needed the money to get us there  i have to do this  i have to take care of myself for them for my family  im your family  wait will you just wait   i cant  what about the band  what about the song  try to understand i have to go  i have to  ill give you a call when things settle down for me  for you what about me what about my family  what about my family   what are you doing  im doing what i have to do   hes got my baby stop it  its all right its not  help help  somebody help hes got my baby  come on please stop  i just want to save him   charlie  its all right  give me the baby  eko tell them tell them what you told me  that the baby has to be baptised  this is not the way  give him to me  who the hell are you aarons not your responsibility  where were you when he was born when he was taken  youre not his father youre not his family  neither are you  i have to do this i need to  im not gonna hurt him  youre hurting me  im sorry  you need stitches  try to be still  i started the fire  yeah i know  i was desperate  i need to know youre never gonna do anything like this again ever  i know what this looks like what people think  it doesnt matter now but i didnt use  i wanted to  i really wanted to  but i didnt  thats not what i asked  its not gonna happen again  charlie told me youre a priest  he said you told him that i had to have  i did not tell charlie to do what he did  im sorry if he misunderstood me  but do you think the baby has to be baptised  do you know what baptism is  its what gets you into heaven  it is said that when john the baptist baptised jesus  the skies opened up and a dove flew down from the sky  this told john something  that he had cleansed this man of all his sins  that he had freed him  heaven came much later  i havent been baptised  does that mean if you do it to aaron and something happened to us  that we wouldnt be together  not if i baptise you both
