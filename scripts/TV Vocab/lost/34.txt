the program  when the alarm sounds either you or your partner must input the code  it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts  in this manner you will both stay as fresh and alert   utmost importance that when the alarm sounds  the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion  do not attempt to use the computer for anything  congratulations  until your replacements arrive the future of the project is in your hands  on behalf of the degroots alvar hanso  and all of us at the dharma initiative  thank you namaste and good luck  all right  so youve been pushing that button every two hours since you got down here  thats right  hows that even work  ive set up twoperson shifts six hours everyones on the roster  dont they wanna know why  i think the films pretty selfexplanatory  really all i heard was something about electromagnets and an incident  what about all the missing pieces  you mean the splices  just a frame here and there i think nothing important  what do you think  about the film what do you think  im sorry i missed it her funeral  i had to be with sawyer so  why arent you with him now  because im going crazy  do you believe in ghosts sayid  i saw walt in the jungle just before shannon was shot  does that make me crazy  its a long drive back to the arraignment you comfy  why now   what  nice cornfed farm girl like you  no history of violence straight as no record couple of speeding tickets  i just gotta wonder why did you kill him now  right yeah dont tell me you wouldnt wanna incriminate yourself  not after you were so smart planning it  that jury back in lowa sure aint gonna get hung up on premeditation  and a gas leak  come on thats amateur hour from top to bottom  sounds like youve got it all figured out   i have you all figured out  you dont know anything about me  whitetrash mom divorces dad starts up with some guy whos a drinker  maybe he knocks her around a little bit so she marries him  because you know thats what happens  then this drunk this wayne he moves into your house  and you get to lay there every night and listen to him doing your mom  right there in your daddys old bedroom  and even that wouldnt be so bad if he didnt beat her up all the time  but she loves him  she defends him  if that dont make a person want to kill somebody i dont know what does  but the question is now why now  why after all these years did you just decide to blow poor wayne up  he come knocking on your door late at night  he never touched me  look out  why cant you just put the numbers in now  no doesnt work that way the alarm goes off at four minutes  you cant type anything until then  you mind if i check out some of this hardware  sure  just dont break it   hello again  hello  i have something i think you should see  if you dont mind i will begin at the beginning  long before christ the king of judah was a man named josiah  boy when you say beginning you mean beginning  at that time the temple where the people worshipped was in ruin  and so the people worshipped idols  false gods and so the kingdom was in disarray  josiah since he was a good king  sent his secretary to the treasury and said we must rebuild the temple  give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done  but when the secretary returned he had no gold  and when josiah asked why this was  the secretary replied  we found a book   do you know this story  no afraid i dont  what the secretary had found was an ancient book  the book of law  you may know it as the old testament  and it was with that ancient book  not with the gold  that josiah rebuilt the temple  on the other side of the island  we found a place much like this  and in this place we found a book  i believe whats inside there will be of great value to you  hey  so roses husbands white   didnt see that one coming  is there something you need hurley  nope just taking a walk  thought id say hey  whos taking care of sawyer  sun is  so youre like mad at him  why would i be mad at sawyer  maybe because hes the one who always comes down here  and chops wood and now you are  its like transference  are you a shrink now  thats what they called it in the mental hospital  im not mad at anyone  wheres jack  i dont know he didnt come back  has he said anything  sawyer  no hes still sleeping  can you watch him   i can stay if you  no yeah i can  thanks  right  yes im sure thats the exact form you got  ill send one over to you right  ill call you back later  hi dad  the police and the us marshals are looking for you   you shouldnt

for your birthday  so i called one of your cos to get some pictures of you in uniform  the pictures he sent me had dates on the back  photos of you in korea up until four months before i was born  why didnt you tell me that wayne was my father  why  i didnt tell you because i knew youd kill him  and your mother loved him  you were five years old i wanted to take you along with me  but she wouldnt let me  so why didnt you kill him  because i dont have murder in my heart  im gonna have to call them  can i have an hour  bye daddy  can you hear me  sawyer  wayne  im probably crazy  and this doesnt matter  but maybe youre in there somehow  and you asked me a question  you asked me why i  why i did it  it wasnt because you drove my father away  or the way you looked at me  or because you beat her  it was because i hated that you were part of me  that i would never be good  that i would never have anything good  and every time that i look at sawyer  every time i feel something for him  i see you wayne  and it makes me sick  thats about the sweetest thing i ever heard  sawyer  who the hell is wayne  am i in a bunk bed  yeah youre in a bunk bed  are we saved  no sawyer  not yet  voil  what

plane fall on different parts of the island  youre over there im over here  and now heres the missing piece right back where it belongs  what are the odds  dont mistake coincidence for fate  youve gotta be kidding me  airlocks over this way  come on admit it weve been rescued  you got it sorry  watch yourself  son of a bitch  watch yourself ok   i got it  ok  home sweet home  yeah  i really

the alarm sounds either you or your partner must input the code  it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts  in this manner you will both stay as fresh and alert   utmost importance that when the alarm sounds  the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion  here it comes  do not attempt to use the computer for anything else  other than the entering of the code this is its only function  the isolation that attends the duties associated with station three  may tempt you to try and utilise the computer  for communication with the outside world this is strictly forbidden  attempting to use the computer in this manner  will compromise the integrity of the project and  worse could lead to another incident  i repeat do not use the computer for anything other than entering the code  congratulations  until your replacements arrive the future of the project is in your hands
