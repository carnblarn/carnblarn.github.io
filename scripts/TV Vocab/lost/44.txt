inviting you im inviting kate  ive already got a gun but thanks for offering  how in the hell did you get a gun  does it matter  ill get my things  ok two months weve been on this island two months  and already we have a water trough  and weve got a food pantry  and people are taking showers in your hatch  have you forgotten that we all crashed on this island   its like none of you want to go home  how can you say that of course we do   why arent we doing anything about it  dude we like built a raft  but it got blown up  ok so what are we doing now  that pallet of food had a parachute  which means a plane dropped it  which means there are other planes that fly over the island  so we are gonna build a sign a massive sign along the beach  so that way if a plane flies over or a satellite takes pictures from up there  we wanna make damn sure that they know were here  that they know about us  maybe we should speak to jack about this first  well do we have to run everything by jack  i mean hes not the president hes hes a doctor  youre a dentist  could i speak to you for just a second  come here  honey it is just a sign i dont see what the harm is  the harm is you are telling these people about airplanes and satellites  coming out of nowhere to save the day  im just trying to do something i want to get back to our life  well the only thing you are doing is giving these people false hope  excuse me  i have a sign to build  all right i want to get this going right away  weve waited long enough  its just amazing isnt it  oh sure its beautiful   youre not impressed huh  oh yeah  so what does god have to do to get your attention  bernard what are you doing  rose  id been a bachelor for 56 years  and then i met you and we just fell into this rhythm  like we had known each other forever  i had always dreamed of finding somebody like you  but id given up hope that i ever would   bernard  i know i know its crazy  i mean we just met five months ago  but

fault  at the very least i expected your support  you had to go and attack me  have you ever stopped to think maybe people are quitting  because youve got yourself a management problem  what is the matter with you rose  i am just trying to do something  thats right youre always trying to do  why cant you just let things be  if i didnt always have to do something you wouldnt be here  im flattered  yeah why is that  because you chose me to go with you instead of sawyer  i asked sayid first but he turned me down  and i only asked you because they dont want you  they grabbed you had you at gunpoint  they coulda kept you but they didnt  then again they didnt really want me either  damaged goods both of us  whats that  kate   its a doll  wait dont  dont dont  sorry   you ok  yeah  oh good

sense of humour got trapped under that door with your leg  i saw your husband walking through the jungle hauling rocks  hes building a big sign in the sand so the satellites will see it  that man doesnt know the difference between an errand and a fools errand  well rose most of us dont  what are you doing down here john  cant remember the last time i saw you out of that hatch  im done with the hatch  oh now youre just frustrated  youll be out of that splint and running around the island again in no time  and yet jack said itd be at least four weeks  but honey you and i both know its not gonna take that long  right this way rose  please make yourself comfortable isaac will be right with you  you must be rose  why dont you have a seat  so how does this work  i sit here and you chant or pray or what  there are certain places with great energy  spots on the earth like the one were above now  perhaps this energy is geological magnetic  or perhaps its something else  and when possible  i harness this energy and give it to others  may i  what  what what is it  im sorry  i cant do anything for you rose  i didnt expect you to  its not that you cant be healed  like i said theres different energies  this is not the right place for you  where is the right place  i wish i knew   ill return your husbands donation  dont  im gonna tell him you fixed me  im going to tell him you fixed me  what did you mean back there   what  in the net  you said they were sophisticated the others  last week when the baby got sick claire and i went into the jungle  and found another hatch   what  like a medical station  there was nothing you could use it was all cleared out but  i found some lockers they had clothes inside all worn and dirty  but they were on hangers like costumes you know  and there was a makeup kit  and a fake beard  when were you gonna tell me this  when you decided to let me back in the club  what  you can keep one of them locked up in the hatch for a week and say nothing  but then when i  were here  are you sure i  thats where they took the shot at sawyer  over there is where they pushed you out of the jungle with a bag on your head  and right there is where i  where i laid my guns down  hey  hey im back  you say youre watching us  you hear me  weve got your man  you want him back youre gonna have to come out here  come on out   jack  i know youre there   i know you can hear me  jack theyre not here  ill be right here until you talk to me  ill be right here  i brought you some supper  thanks you can just set it down there  where is everybody  i owe you an apology  you dont have to be sorry its my own fault im here by myself  thats not why im apologizing  i lied to you  back in australia isaac he didnt heal me  he didnt do anything   of course he did youre  bernard he didnt heal me  but that doesnt mean im not healed  when youre sick and you have something inside you that doesnt belong there  you can feel it  and after the crash i couldnt feel it anymore  at first i thought it was just shock  but it wasnt  its this place  but you said isaac fixed you  i told you that  so that you wouldnt spend what time we had left trying to do something  rose you could just be in remission  how do you know it wasnt isaac   how do you know he didnt heal you  i know  i know  these yours  thank you  youre welcome  trust me  i know  you dont want to be rescued do you  you think if you leave itll come back  and if you cant leave  neither can i  we wont ever leave rose  i would  i would offer to take down the sign but we didnt get very far  hey  hi  i pressed your button  its not my button  where did you go  i just needed to stretch my legs  how long are you gonna wait jack  until i get my voice back  and then im gonna yell some more  maybe they cant hear you  they can hear me  im sorry i kissed you  im not  michael
