arms  yelling dont do that  well youve got a point there  i guess i was excited to get inside thats why we came here isnt it  thats why we went out to the black rock  and got the dynamite to blow the hatch  we did it so we could get inside hugo  and to save everybodys lives  and to save everyones lives  or maybe it was just our destiny right john  maybe  guys its the hatch door youd better see this   vincent  this is not a good idea  i saw him five minutes ago  besides you said there wasnt anyone out here  i said we didnt see anyone  the dog will come back on his own he always does  watching that dog was the one thing anybody ever asked me to do  if something happens to him  when was the last time you slept or had something to eat youre exhausted  i cant tell that kid i lost his dog because i was exhausted   ill circle around behind him  ok  vincent  sayid  sayid  where are you sayid  sayid  walt  what are you doing here  shannon  what is it  what  why do you want to get down there so bad  ly why do i want to get down there so badly  jack thinks im crazy doesnt he  why cos you want to drop into a hatch thats been locked from the inside  by a footthick steel door that says quarantine  look at the bright side the damage is done  bright side  and if jack thinks ive lost it i cant blame him really  then again five hours ago i was pulled into a hole  by what appeared to be a column of black smoke  did you see it kate  then i guess were both crazy  i wonder what jack thinks he saw  you should go ahead man dont want locke making time with your girl  joke dude  not really in the mood hurley  really wow usually youre like mr haha  there ya go lifes not so bad right  sure the others are coming to like eat us all  and every once in a while someone blows up all over you  but we do get to sleep in every morning  and the numbers   what  the numbers are bad  thats what you were yelling right when i tackled you   yeah its kind of a long story  ive got time   youll think im crazy  try me  a while ago i was in this kind of psych ward and there was this guy leonard  all the time i knew him all he ever said were these numbers  4 8 1 5 1 6 23 42 over and over and over again  and they kind of got stuck in my head  so when i got out well actually a couple months after i got out  i was buying a frozen burrito and thought l should play the lottery  and i guess those numbers were stuck in my head so i played them  and i won 1 1 4 million  thats when it started happening my grandpa died  my house caught on fire  the chicken joint that i worked at got hit by a meteor  well actually a meteorite  ok so tonight i see the same freaking numbers on that hatch thing  just written on the side  and thats why i tried to stop it because that thing is cursed man  you were in a psych ward   im not crazy  im not saying you are   so what thats it thats all  what do you want me to say   how about you believe me  hurley theyre numbers  whats that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you   bedside manner  yeah that  yours sucks dude  what happened to him  just try to relax ok  the car that i hit the other driver was older  he died in the er  i cant feel anything  i know  whats happened to me  you have a fracture dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine  with multiple crushed vertebrae  your back is broken  your spleen is ruptured  and bleeding into your abdomen and has to be stopped  im gonna operate and repair as much as possible  but even the most optimistic result puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling  or mobility anywhere below the waist at  extremely unlikely  dr shephard may i have a word please   so whatd i do wrong  you did something wrong   youre frowning  my face is always this way  dad hey come on lets hear it  you might want to try handing out some hope every once in a while  even if theres a 99 per cent probability  that theyre hopelessly screwed  folks are much more inclined to hear that one per cent chance  that things are gonna be ok  her spine is crushed  i tell her that everythings gonna be ok thats false hope dad  maybe maybe  but its still hope  xray to the er  i know what i saw it was him it was walt   please lower your voice  i heard whispers   where  everywhere   what whispers who  i dont know them   something happened to the raft  nothing happened   walt was with your husband sawyer  sayid i know what i saw  theyre back  locke found a  hatch in the ground about a half mile from here  we left to blow it open so we could hide inside  so all of us could hide inside in case  but it doesnt matter its not gonna work  theres no way for all of us to get in there tonight  jack wheres dr arzt   he didnt make it  what   oh my god  did you see them   did you see the others  hey shannon there are no others   weve had this conversation  what would you know  you didnt see anything you dont know you dont know  hey  everythings going to be ok  lets just iets take it easy were gonna be all right  were gonna stay here tonight ok together  weve still got four guns well put lookouts at all the entrances  were all gonna be safe as long as we stay together  the sun comes up in three hours  and we are all gonna be here to see that happen  i promise   john what are you doing  im getting some cable  what for  its for the hatch im going in  you think thats the smartest thing to do right now john  i doubt it in fact youre right  safest thing is to stay here wait for morning  wait for these others to see if they ever show up  wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help  but me im tired of waiting  so do you believe it  believe what  that everythings gonna be ok  yeah i do  kind of unlike you the whole glasshalffull thing  theres a glass  you did a good thing saying
