now   you wanna make snowballs  hold the bamboo tighter  i think   hey  hey   hows it coming  its coming  long as nobody sabotages this one as well huh  i got people standing guard 24l7  nobody gets near this with or without intent to burn  i was thinking uh the chances of a passing ship  spotting this raft out there is pretty slim  we could use something to send a distress call  to any ship that might be close like an sos  ok ill ask sayid but even if he could make something like that  hes not gonna have anything to power it with  didnt sayid say that crazy french chick had batteries   absolutely not  im not asking you to go   ill do it  no you wont   were trying  do you think she would  give up something she needs to a stranger  all im asking is for you to tell me how to find her thats it  i was brought unconscious to her camp  i was disoriented i dont know how to find her  dont know dude or dont want to  sayid look youve got her maps and her papers  you thought they were pointing to something   i was wrong  maybe theyre pointing to her  look i dont know what these papers mean  they could be the ravings of her disturbed mind  song lyrics mixed with equations  if this map is pointing to her  then you should know she resides here in this area  she gave it a name territoire fonce   shannon translated it  it means dark territory that sound like a place youd like to visit   so you wont help  i didnt say that  ill build the distress beacon i suggest you find another power source   something in the cockpit  were not going to the cockpit   swing your partner dosey

wrote this stuff  its the middle of the night what do you want  nothing couldnt sleep  and i got curious  you and shannon  you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff  and i was wondering what  you guys figured out about this stuff   what stuff  i dont know  well take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times  got any idea what it means  i thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind  coordinates yeah  but when you first found her the french chick  you said you saw a wire or something on the beach  you followed it and it led you to her  no it led me into a trap she set  but her place is probably close right   why are you interested in rousseau  im not  just making conversation dude  sorry if its a bad time  good night  yeah you  how did you come

but sams been dead for four years  your husband worked with a guy i know leonard simms  thats right they served together in the us navy  how is leonard  still in the service  uh hes um retired  anyway he told me about sam  hearing something   youre talking about the numbers  yes  the numbers exactly  do you know anything about them  sam and leonard were stationed at a listening post  monitoring longwave transmissions out of the pacific  boring job sam hated it  nothing to do but listen to static night after night  until one night about 16 years ago  theres something in the static  a voice comes through  a voice repeating those numbers  over and over again  couple of days later were at the fair in kalgoorlie  and some wally theres got this jar must have been big as a pony  its filled to the rim with beans fellas offering 50 grand to anyone  able to guess how many beans were in that jar within ten   sam used the numbers  yep  the answer was exact to the bean  man had been running the same scam for 40 years  nobody had ever come close  so we won the money  on the way home a pickup truck blows a tire on the highway  hits us headon  lost my leg that night   what about sam  barely a scratch  most people would consider themselves lucky  but not him  he was never the same after that  he started keeping a record  anything terrible that happened to anyone around us  he believed it was all because he used those numbers  he moved us out here in the middle of nowhere hoping it would stop  did it  did he ever find a way to make it stop  yep  he put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger  what is it youre looking for mr reyes  i used them  the numbers  to win the lottery  and now i think im under the same curse  curse theres no curse   you just told me  you think id still have my leg  if sam hadnt have picked the right number of beans  floods wouldnt have happened  homes wouldnt have burned people wouldnt have died  well yeah  you make your own luck mr reyes  dont blame it on the damn numbers  youre looking for an excuse that doesnt exist  its a trap right  for catching animals  pass me that cup please   ugh whats this gunk  glue  whered you find glue  i made it out of rendered animal fat  you made glue  wow  you should have one of those shows where you fix up houses for people  i dont think so  thanks for this  giving me something to do  im tired of

weird  but i just go along with it  cause im along for the ride  good old funtime hurley  well guess what  now i want some freaking answers  our ship picked up a transmission  a voice repeating those numbers  we changed course to investigate  after we shipwrecked  my team continued to search for the transmission source  it was weeks before we found the radio tower  theres a radio tower on this island  yes up by the black rock  some of us continued to search for the meaning of those numbers  while we waited for rescue  but then the sickness came  when my team was gone  i went back up to the tower  and changed the transmission   that distress signal we heard  yes  but the numbers  did you ever find out anything about them  do you know where they got their power  power  they bring bad stuff to everyone around you  theyre cursed you know that right  the numbers are cursed  the numbers are what brought me here  as it appears theyve brought you  since that time  ive lost everything  everyone i cared about  so yes  i suppose youre right  they are cursed  thank you  thank you  you have no idea how long ive been waiting  for somebody to agree with me  thank you oh god thank you  we need to find hurley and charlie  get out of this jungle  i hate that were going home emptyhanded  hey  someone shot at us hurley and me   we were looking for you when  rousseau   wheres hurley  i dont

scarce but your shirt  when you find a laundromat let me know  back in the jungle  before we became target practice you were gonna tell me  what inspired this little quest  i think the plane crash might have been my fault   dont be daft how could you  before we came here  a lot of bad stuff used to happen whenever i was around   what do you mean like bad luck  yeah thats  thatd be kind of a mellow way of describing it  hurley bad things happen  planes crash people die  you ought to let me finish  you think youre the only person with baggage  you know what i was doing when the plane went down  i was snorting heroin in the toilet  i was such a junkie  i couldnt even take a plane ride without having a fix  i suppose that was your fault as well  so how about it  what  i just told you the biggest secret in my life  thought youd wanna reciprocate  okay  back home  im worth 156 million dollars  fine dont tell me   dude  i bare my soul  and all i get is bloody jokes
