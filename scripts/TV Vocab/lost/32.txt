heard him shouting from the beach  from the beach  why are you asking me about that ana  did he see you out there  is that why you pretended to be one of us  you ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash  you werent wet  you were never even in the ocean  where are they  your friends  nathan what did you  if you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane  i think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy  did you kill him  nathan was not a good person  thats why he wasnt on the list  what about the kids did you kill them too  the children
