it you were santa last year  i dont know some fat guys sleeping with the store manager  hes not even jolly its all political  what are you gonna be  im gonna be one of his helpers  its just such a slap in the face you know  hey do you guys know what youre doing for new years  hey what what is wrong with new years  nothing for you you have paolo you dont have to face the pressure      of finding anything with lips to kiss when the ball drops  man im talking loud  for your information paolos gonna be in rome this new years  ill be just as pathetic as the rest of you  yeah you wish  im sick of being a victim this dick clark holiday  i say this year no dates we make a pact  just the six of us dinner  sure fine  i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm  youre on  oh good  okay hi ladies and gentlemen back by popular demand      miss phoebe buffay  thanks hi  i want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year  i made a man with eyes of coal  and a smile so bewitchin   how was i supposed to know  that my mom was dead in the kitchen  my mothers ashes  even her eyelashes  are resting in a little yellow jar  and sometimes when its freezing  i feel a little sneezy  and now i excuse me excuse me  noisy boys  is it something youd like to share with the group  no thats okay  if its important enough to discuss while im playing      i assume its important enough for everyone else to hear  that guys going home with a note  i was just saying could you speak up  sorry  i was saying you were the most beautiful woman id ever seen  and you said daryl hannah      was the most beautiful woman hed ever seen  and i said i liked her in splash but not in wall street  i thought she had a hard quality a hard quality  and while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way      you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace  then thats when you started yelling  okay were gonna take a short break  i think that guys going home with more than a note  come here marcel sit here  pheebs i cant believe he hasnt kissed you yet  i mean by my sixth date with paolo hed already named both my breasts  did i just share too much  just a smidge  davids like a scientist guy hes very methodical  i think its romantic  me too  did you ever see an officer and a gentleman  hes kind of like the guy i went to see that with  except hes smarter and gentler and sweeter  i just want to be with him all the time  you know day and night and night and day  and special occasions  i see where this is going youre gonna ask him to new years  youll break the pact shes breaking the pact  yeah could i just    yeah because i already asked janice  come on this was a pact this was your pact  i couldnt handle the pressure and i snapped  but janice that was the worst breakup in history  im not saying it was a good idea i snapped  hi sorry im late  too many jokes  must mock joey  nice shoes huh  god youre killing me  hes playing with my spatulas again  look hes not gonna hurt them right  do you always have to bring him here  i didnt want to leave him alone  we had our first fight this morning  it has to do with my working late  i said some things that i didnt mean  he threw some feces  if youre working late i can look in on him  that would be great  but make sure it seems like youre there to see him      and youre not doing it as a favor to me  okay but if he asks im not going to lie  but you cant actually test this theory  because todays particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough      to simulate these conditions  all right i have a question then  were you planning on kissing me ever  thats definitely a valid question      and the answer      would be yes  yes i was  but see i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss      that happened at this phenomenal moment because its you  sure  right but the longer i waited the more phenomenal the kiss had to be  and now its just got to be one of those things where i      sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it  and im not really a sweeping sort of fella  oh david i think you are a sweeping sort of fella   i mean youre a sweeper trapped inside a physicists body  really im sure of it  you should just do it just sweep and throw me  now  right now just     you know what this is just really expensive  and this was a gift  now youre just tidying up okay what the hell  you want me to actually throw you i can hop  tell me something what does nodate pact mean to you  im sorry its just that chandler has somebody and phoebe has somebody  i thought id ask fun bobby  fun bobby your
