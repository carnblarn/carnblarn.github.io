believe it this sucks  you just got him how could he be an adult already  i know one day hes this little thing  and then hes this little thing i cant get off my leg  isnt there any way to keep him  no the vet said unless hes in a place  where he has regular access  to some monkey loving   hes just gonna get vicious  i just gotta get him into a zoo  how do you get a monkey into a zoo i know  no thats popes into a vokswagen  were applying to a lot our first choice would be a big state zoo  you know like san diego right  but that may just be a pipe dream hes outofstate  my vet knows someone at miami so thats a possibility  but thats two blocks from the beach its a total party zoo  we found the girl  did you call the cops we took her to lunch  oh your own brand of vigilante justice  are you insane this woman stole from you  she stole shes a stealer  after youre with this woman for 10 minutes you forget that  i mean shes this astounding person with this amazing spirit  which she probably stole from some cheerleader  take off their hats popes in a vokswagen  i love that joke  no way no way did you do this monana was very brave  we told them we were the gundersons in room 61 5  only to find out the boston celtics had the entire floor  when they saw that were short and have breasts  they threw us out i was thrown out of a hotel me  go monana  you ladies are not the only ones living the dream  i get to go pour coffee for people i dont know dont wait up  oh by the way  tomorrow were auditioning for a broadway show  excuse me theres an open call for cats  im thinking we sing memories  and make complete fools of ourselves what do you say  no no no remember who youre dealing with here  i cant even stand in front of a tap class  thats because of your amish background  what youre pennsylvania dutch right  right till i bought a blow dryer then i was shunned  i was just like you and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life  did you ever see dead poets society  i thought that movie was so incredibly boring  that thing at the end where the kid  kills himself because he cant be in the play  its like kid wait a year leave home do some community theater  i thought thats two hours of my life that im never getting back  that scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do  wow then i would definitely not recommend mrs doubtfire  oh god  we didnt get

cornered  well i dont know why  how is he at handling small objects  he can hold a banana if thats what you mean  what about a hammer or a small blade  why would he need a blade  if hes up against an animal with horns  you got to give him something  otherwise its just cruel  he got into san diego what  we came back from our walk the phone was ringing  hes in  did you hear that marcel san diego san
