thing  what about all that lockerroom stuff  thats different thats like who dated a stripper  or who did it on the back of the staten island ferry   both of those joey  yeah  but you dont talk about your girlfriend  and the intimate stuff you do with her   not even with your best friend  no  that is so sad  youre missing out on so much i mean the bonding and the sharing  and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are  so what you tell each other everything  pretty much  did you talk about the night of five times  do you tell people about the night of five times  honey

breeze  and the moonlight flowing through the trees  ill bet hes over me ill bet hes fine  betting and wagering of any kind are not permitted in the happy place  theres just you know the lovely waterfalls  and the trickling fountains  and the calming sounds of the babbling brook  okay this isnt working  im still awake and now i have to pee  guess who  janice hi you just missed chandler  but wont you come in before you go  so i hear  you hate me  i never said hate i was very careful about that  a little birdie told me you wanted to rip your arm off and throw it at me  and you got hate from that youre taking a big leap there  all right fine fine fine  we have got to do something about our little situation here  so this is my idea  you and me spending some quality time together   but what does that  for chandler  okay im in  okay this is what well call it joey and janices day of fun  does it have to be a whole day  yes because thats how long it takes to love me  yeah i know i sleep in the next room  so do you guys all hate janice too  you hate janice now joeys gonna be so relieved  oh my god  oh my god  well look everybody its weepy  the mime that cares too much  then i went down to the post office  and it turns out it was those videos that i ordered for richard  about the civil war  he loved the civil war  monica do you want us to take you home  or maybe to a galaxy far far away  women tell each other everything did you know that  no chandler everything  like stuff you like stuff she likes  technique stamina girth  girth  why why why why  why would they do this  rachel says sharings great and supposedly  you know we ought to be doing it  do you wanna  were not gonna talk about girth are we   okay  yeah  all right you go first  okay okay ill go first  so the other night  rachel and i are in bed talking about fantasies  and i happened to describe a particular  star wars thing   princess leia and the gold bikini  yes  i know  well that was easy   okay you go  okay  you know when youre in bed with a woman  and fooling around  and you get all these mental images in your brain  like elle macpherson or the girl at the xerox place   with the bellybutton ring  i know  and then all of a sudden your mom pops into your head  and youre like mom get out of here  but after that you cant think of anything else  and you cant stop what youre doing so its kind of like youre  you know  you know  you dont know  your mom  youre telling me about your mom what is the matter with you   you said  i said share not scare  go sit over there  were back  what are you
