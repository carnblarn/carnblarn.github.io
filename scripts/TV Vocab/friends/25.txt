frankie tell him joey tribbiani says hello  hell know what it means  you sure hell crack that code  its funny the last time paolo was here my hair was so much cuter  all right  but you have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy  and all monica about it  i promise  all right lets see  now some of you are gonna get cut and some of you arent  but i promise none of you will feel a thing   thats it i quit  what i didnt say anything  but this isnt the face of a person who trusts a person  this is the face of a person who you know  doesnt trust a person  im sorry im sorry  its just a little shorter than what we had discussed  would you relax i know what i am doing  this is how he wears it  how who wears it  demi moore  demi moore is not a he  well he was a he in arthur and in 10  thats dudley moore  i said i wanted it like demi moore  oh my god  oh god  oh my god im sorry  which one is demi moore  shes the actress that was in disclosure indecent proposal ghost  shes got gorgeous hair  i know  how long do you want the cuffs  at least as long as i have the pants  i just got that  now well do your inseam  how is she  its too soon to tell  shes resting which is a good sign  hows the hair  im not gonna lie to you it doesnt look good  i put a clip on one side which seems to have stopped the curling  can we see her  your hair looks too good itd upset her  ross you come on in  well how you doing  im okay  that bad huh  look i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable  its one of my gifts  joey when i saw him get off that plane with her  i really thought i just hit rock bottom  but today its like theres rock bottom  50 feet of crap  then me  tell ross how you feel  come on how can i just tell him what about julie  what about her theyve only been going out for two weeks  ross has been in love with you for 10 years  i dont know i dont know  ive been with my share of women  ive been with a lot of peoples share of women  but the point is  ive never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you  really  yo paisan  can i talk to you for a sec  your tailor  is a very bad man  what are you talking about  hey whats going on  joeys tailor  took advantage of me  no way ive been going to the guy for 12 years  he said he was gonna do my inseam  then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite  what  cupping  thats how they do pants  first they go up one side they move it over  then they go up the other side move it back then they do the rear  ross tell him isnt that how a tailor measures pants  yes yes it is in prison  whats the matter with you  what  thats not  oh my god  even mary tyler moore wouldve been better  i like it  i do i think its a 10  thank you  my hair is very amused  come on things could be worse  you could get caught between the moon and new york city  i know its crazy but its true  thank you  well i gotta go bye  bye rach  wait are you leaving  thats what i meant by bye  can i talk to you for a sec  when the doctor does that hernia test  thats okay  whats going on  well okay first of all  paolo and i are not back together  that was a stupid thing i did  if i could go back in time and do it again  well i wouldnt  second of all  what  is this one of those things where you break up with a guy  i tell you what i think  and the next day you get back together with him  and i look like a complete idiot  well then i think the guys scum  i hate him i mean i actually i physically hate him  i always have  and you are way too good to be with a guy like that  really  you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you  and who gets how funny  and sweet and amazing  and adorable and sexy you are  you know someone who wakes up every morning thinking  oh my god im with rachel  you know someone who makes you feel good  like the way i do with julie  was there a second of all  no i think that was the whole all  i gotta go  thanks  no i swear to god dad  thats not how they measure pants  i was thinking of doing it shorter like andie macdowells haircut   yeah i could do that  really   you wanna do it now  great  see you  i just wanna make really sure this time  andie macdowell is the girl from four weddings and a funeral right  no  thats roddy mcdowall  andie macdowell is the guy from planet of the apes   thank you  youre welcome
