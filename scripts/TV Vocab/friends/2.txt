                what you guys dont understand is for us  kissing is as important as any part of it  yeah right  you serious  oh yeah  everything you need to know is in that first kiss  absolutely  yeah i think for us kissing is pretty much  like an opening act yknow i mean its like the standup comedian you have to sit  through before pink floyd comes out  yeah andand its not that  we dont like the comedian  its thatthat thats not  why we bought the ticket  the problem is though after the concerts over no matter how great the show was  you girls are always looking for the comedian again yknow  i mean were in the car were fighting traffic basically  just trying to stay awake  yeah well word of advice  bring back the comedian  otherwise next time youre gonna find yourself  sitting at home listening to that album alone  are we still talking about sex  friends  the sonogram at the end  no its good it is good  its just that mm  doesnt she seem a little angry  well she has issues  does she  hes out banging other women over the head with a club while she sits at home  trying to get the mastodon  smell out of the carpet  marsha these are cave people okay  they have issues like

ammunition than they already have  yes and we all know how cruel a parent  can be about the flatness of a childs pillow  monica hi  um monica youre scaring me  i mean youre like youre like all chaotic and twirly  and notnot in a good way  yeah calm down  you dont see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come  thats because as far as my parents are concerned ross can do no wrong  ysee

boys  were going in  hi  wow that is not a happy hi  carols pregnant  ooh i found it  w w wh  wha w w w  yeah do that for another two hours  you might be where i am right about now  kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective huh mon  well now how how do you fit into this whole thing  well carol says she and susan want me to be involved but if im not comfortable  with it i dont have to be involved  basically its entirely up to me  she is so great i miss her  what does she mean by involved  i mean presumably the biggest part of your job is done  anyway they want me to go down to this  sonogram thing with them tomorrow  so what are you gonna do  i have no idea  no matter what i do though im still gonna be a father  well this is still ruined right  oh martha ludwins daughter is gonna

restaurant i work in a restaurant  well they dont have to know that  ross could you come and help me with the spaghetti please  yeah oh were having spaghetti  thats easy  i know this is going to sound  unbelievably selfish  but were you planning on bringing up the whole babylesbian thing  because i think it might take  some of the heat off me  what that rachel did to her life we ran into her parents at the club  they were not playing very well  im not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding  but forty thousand dollars  is a lot of money  well at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar  whats that supposed to mean  nothing  its an expression no its not  dont listen to your mother youre independent and you always have been  even when you were a kid  and you were chubby and you had  no friends you were just fine  and you would read alone in your room and your puzzles  look there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars  with his museum and his papers getting published  other people are satisfied with staying where they are  im telling you these are the people who never get cancer  and i read about these women  trying to have it all  and i thank god our little harmonica doesnt seem to have that problem  so ross whats going on with you any stories  no news no little anecdotes  to share with the folks  okay okay look i uh i realise you
