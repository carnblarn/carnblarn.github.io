 when all of a sudden i realize  sweet n low  i realized  i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry  and then i really freaked out when it hit me  how much barry looks like mr potato head  i always knew he looked familiar but     i had to get out of there and i started wondering       why am i doing this and who am i doing this for  i didnt know where to go and i know you and i have drifted apart      but youre the only person i know in the city  who wasnt asked to the wedding  i was kind of hoping that wouldnt be an issue  i guess he bought her the pipe organ      and shes really not happy about it  daddy i just i cant marry him  im sorry  i just dont love him  well it matters to me  she should not be wearing those pants  i say push her down the stairs  push her down
