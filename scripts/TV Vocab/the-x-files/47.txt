dead it was my fault morris morris i need to talk to you come to the door morris pleaseanswer the door dammit oh no no oh god no no god god no no no no no no please no please two apparent abductionsin a month then this one my contact says the richmond pds hita brick wall so i said wed have a look  whos your contact kelly ryan she was one of my students at the academy shes been bumped up to detective and shes nervous about her supervisorfinding out the fbi are involved  kelly agent scully  hi this is agent mulder hi thank you for coming  youre welcome heard a lot about you well talk later the missing man is patrick newirth aged 52 hes a top executive with morley tobaccoup here for a meeting  he arrived by train how do you know hes missing he set a wakeup call for 6amthe operator tried but got no answer mm scotch it looks likehe barely touched it needless to say he missed his meetingafter three hours they sent hotel security up the door was locked security chain fastenedand when they broke in no patrick newirth  windows locked from the inside were six storeys up no fire escapeno way in or out of this room  agent scully what are you lookin at uh the heat register  you think anyone could squeeze in there you never know  you guys turn up any forensics evidence uh just this  scully look at this what is it we dont know the hotel claimsit wasnt here before mr newirth checked in there were similar burn marksat the previous crime scenes  was patrick newirth a smoker no his wife says he loathed cigarettes  yet he worked for a tobacco company did you run a test on it yes sir mostly carbonwith some potassium and trace minerals  could be residue from burnt human flesh does this look like an arm to anybody  an arm what are you thinkin mulder this burn mark is right whereid stand to answer the door right  yes and id only look out the peephole if there was something to look at right that makes sense  could you have this bulb dusted for prints of course and can you run those againstmr newirths do you have his prints from his toiletries and checkin slip check them againstall hotel employees and guests  anything else whats the name of the last missing person that would be margaret wysnecki thanks this should do it is this your first case detective  yes sir any idea why they gave it to you no one else wanted it because of the lack of evidencethis is still a missing persons case not likely to end up on the front pages i wouldnt be so sure about that can i ask what you thinkmay have happened at first blushspontaneous human combustion youre doing just fine  having a little fun what do you mean  spontaneous human combustion i have case files of bodies reduced to ash with no attendant burning or meltingrapid oxidation without heat lets forget that theresno scientific theory to support it ok hey scully can you spare a prophylactic what are the odds of that huh darkness covers a multitude of sins check this out my newest toolin the fight against crime 4995 at your local hardware store neat trick for your birthdayill buy you a utility belt  look at this mulder hm what do we know about the victim margaret wysnecki aged 66 widowed retired from laramie tobaccowhere she worked for 36 years tobacco patrick newirthworked for morley tobacco half of richmond earns their paycheckmaking cancer sticks  could be just a coincidence yeah probably the first missing person gail anne lambertworked for polarity magnetics inc they didnt find any prints why shouldthe prints on the bulb mean anything i dont know oh look at this scullysomeone forgot to empty the trash m wysnecki round trip to hampton roadsvirginia return train dated march 17th  the day she disappeared patrick newirth came by train and gail anne lambert uh no nothing hereputs her near the train station  maybe that detail was overlooked whats the significance maybe these people are being huntedand the hunters working the train station what about spontaneoushuman combustion maybe its not spontaneouscall your young detective and tell her to get a detaildown to the train station suspicious male in the alleybehind the station im gonna check him out roger that 64 im on my way sir could i speak with you hold on i only wanna ask youa couple of questions all right stop right theredont move just hold it put your hands in the air sir stay away from me what do you think youre doincome on outta there we just wanna talk to you stay away from me i dont wanna hurt you  move it hands where we can see them please im warning you  im a dangerous man keep movin pal out where we can see ya all right i want you tolie face down on the ground dont come any closer get down on the ground sir now please you dont understand  oh god no barney dont no stay away oh god oh god not again no no no no  what happened here kelly i sent two patrolmen down here they lost radio contactwith them just after midnight  all they found was two more scorch marks nothing else no suddenly this could be a copkiller caseand im indirectly responsible  you were just doing your job they wanna know why i sent these men  if i tell them ive involved you theyll snap those prints i ran it against allthe hotel staff and guests then through the nationaldatabases no match  some first case huh make sure you hang on to this case im sure something will turn up  these ideas of yours care to share them not yet  you dont have a clue do you he was here scully i was right about that  so where does this leave us maybe with enough to identify the killer  how he was here last night he was also probably hereon march 17th and march 31st the days that the othertwo people disappeared that leaves us with three daysof station video tapes to check and hopefully find out who this guy is thats assuming were looking for a guy either way the security camerasour only witness it could be any one of these people mulder or none of them weve gone through the entire weekand im still not sure how to find him thats it for march 22nd on the arrival deck  lets go back to the terminal tape again hes gotta be on at least one tape chances are hes not carryinga sign with an arrow on it there you go see this guy right here hes always here whats he doing  looking at the floor whys he doin that probably the same reason he spendshis whole afternoon in the train station  can you freeze this and blow it up 200 sure ok can you reframeand blow it up some more see hes got something on his jacket lets see if i can pull it up  polarity magnetics thats where the first victim worked looks like its been closed up  yes were agents mulder and scully fbi were looking for a manwho may have worked here  when was this taken march 22nd do you know him sure i know him dr chester banton  he was my business partner you mean hes not any more i dont know i would assume not this is the first ive seen of him in five weeks  i wondered if he wasnt gonna turn up dead hows that chester was involvedin a terrible accident here polarity magnetics does or didprimarily two kinds of research mostly we designed maglev applications people movers bullet trains but for chester that just paid the billsfor the theoretical stuff he was interested in  which was what researching dark matter quantum particles neutrinosgluons mesons quarks  subatomic particles the mysteries of the universe  the very building blocks of reality except no one knows if they exist chester was sure they did so sure he bet his life on it this is where it happened chesterwas working to isolate a new particle  hed been working on it for a year this is a particle accelerator one fifth the power of the texassupercollider in the space of a walmart  powered by what a couple of billion megawatts  virginia power loved us exactly what happened here the work involved bombardingbeta particles with an alpha target negative against positive chester had started the countdownwhen he realised hed made a mistake something needed readjustingin the target room except you cant stopthe countdown once youve begun there was time to safely make the change but i had left the room for a minutewhen chester decided to go in i didnt realise until it was too latethat the door had locked behind him look at this as far as i can tell it burnedchesters shadow right into the wall  how did he survive all i can figure is the quanta liberated off the targethave virtually no mass  they slid right through his body like getting an xray a twobillionmegawatt xray when i saw on the monitorwhat was happening that chester was trapped in here i panicked i cut the power but it was too late i remember looking and seeing chester he was perfectly calm almost like he wanted it to happen like he was finally going to experiencethe dark matter he had theorised in some kind of physical way as if the truth might come into him excuse me what do you think scully well this looks like the same kind ofmaterial found at the other crime scenes maybe it is some kind ofspontaneous human combustion im less convinced of that now  what do you think it is i dont know whatever it is its connected to the person ofdr chester banton maybe even part of him well whatever it iswe have to find him i know of only one place to start lookin theres no sign of him muldermaybe hes moved on  what are you looking at on the tape he kept staring at the floor im trying to figure outwhat he might have been looking at maybe the exposure affected his mind nonsensical repetitive behaviouris common in mental illness you trying to tell me something i called detective ryan shes having theprints on the bulbs checked against bantons did you tell her about his accident no i only told her he was a possible suspectand that it was too early to get her hopes up and that we have morequestions than answers  like like a motive like a murder weapon  like what if dr banton look here there arehardly any shadows cast  what do you mean the lighting in here is diffused soft light what if thats whatdr banton was looking for looking for his shadow dr banton stop right there dr banton please just leave me alone were federal agents dr banton you dont understandyoure making a big mistake stay away from me wait itll kill you it doesnt care who you are oh thank god  i thought he was to be kept in the dark he insisted on soft light its the only way hed let us open the door how can you even beginto understand what its like  were trying to understand living in a train station day and night living like a bum afraid to fall asleepbecause of what might happen the accident in the labthe quantum bombardment you believe that altered you physically you could you could say that can you tell us how even if i could you wouldnt understand  but it has something to do with dark matter it has everything to do with dark matter my shadow isnt mine its its like a black hole it splits molecules into component atoms it unzips electrons from their orbitsreduces matter into pure energy  thats how you killed gail anne lambert it wasnt me gail anne was my colleague she the night after the accident i went to see her i was just standing in the doorway i was i was looking right at her and then she was gone you have no control over it if i could control it do you thinki would let it go around killing people all i can do is study it try and divine itsits true nature before they do they the government theyre after me and when they find me theyre going to do the brain sucktheyve just been dying to do brain suck for the purpose of for the purpose of stealing whathas taken me years to accomplish and dont thinkthey wouldnt kill to get it but if they killed youwouldnt your shadow just disappear who knows thats why you have to get me out of here if i die there could benothing left to tether this thing excuse me im gonna have to ask you todiscontinue interrogating the suspect this is detective barronthe primary on this case  i was wondering what your involvement is we caught the guy i appreciate that but no one seems torecall inviting the fbi in on this case agent mulder and i are herein an unofficial capacity then who brought you in we were curious aboutthe unexplained nature of the case bantons prints place himat two of the crime scenes and transit authority tapes show him in thevicinity of two of the most recent victims  id say this case is pretty much explained really have you talked to dr banton dont try to interrogate meagent mulder im not the suspect you know nothing about this caseso you stuck it with detective ryan  let her decide how to proceed she is handling this case shes done well i see no reason not to let her prosecute itonce the prisoner has been transferred transferred where to the city jail for his arraignment i dont think you appreciatethe danger that he poses i dont think you have the authority to tell meor anyone else in my unit how to do our job i think we can handle itfrom here agent mulder well call you if theresanything more you can do come on mulder lets go soft light he needs soft light i hope you know what youre doing puttingdetective ryans ambition over good sense ambition shes a womantrying to survive the boys club  believe me i know how she feels you never put yourself ahead of your work and thats whats happening here look the fact is we have no jurisdictionhere we were called in as a favour and we just handed the abombto the boy scouts im sure precautions will be taken im sure robert oppenheimer heard that fromthe same government dr banton is afraid of you believe this paranoiaabout brain sucking that man is scaredand not just of his own shadow as brilliant as dr banton may behe is also clearly delusional  he shows almost every textbook indicator weve both seen the physical evidence look i dont know how to explain itbut thats not our job i dont know what else we should do i think i do all youve given me is a namechester ray banton  dr chester ray banton do you know him no should i hes being held by the policein connection with several bizarre murders hes a physicist researchingquarks gluons dark matter  he thinks the government is out to get him its tax season so do most americans  he believes his life is in danger is he a dangerous man yes yes  where is he being held yaloff psychiatric hospital  but not for long im afraid i cant help you  why last time i helped you i bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identityto associates of yours yes i know and you can trust themas you trust me i promise dead men cant keep promises the next time the bloodand regret could be yours im not at your beck and call agent mulder i have nothing to gain andeverything to lose by helping you promise you wont contact me againunless absolutely necessary i promise frank are your lights on ours just went hi were here to transferchester ray banton i have orders hes beingtransferred tomorrow due to the power outagetheres been a change of plans no ones supposed to go in there here quickly who are you no dont do this please no no dont leave me alone  what did you find out scully richmond pd had two officers outside  they didnt see anybody come in the nurse said there were three men three the power was disconnectedat a substation two blocks away somebody posing as a city engineer somebody who knew how to take it off thegrid without affecting surrounding facilities somebody from the governmentcoming for dr banton being paranoid doesnt mean hes wrong but my guess is they failedand dr bantons on the loose  thats what detective ryan thinks i just saw her she was in charge of his transfer andarraignment shes in some pretty hot water maybe that was an appointmenthe wasnt meant to keep lets go  where mulder wait where are we going you heard what dr banton said last night  he said a lot of things put yourself in his head he hasnt killed himself only becausehes afraid of releasing the dark matter thats just a theoryand a pretty wild one at that whether or not dr banton is actuallytelling the truth he believes he is and so does whoever triedto take him last night all hes tried to do is control this thing hell go to the one place where he thinkshe can do that and we gotta get there first dont turn on the light chrisunless you wanna die chester what the hell is going on the fbi are looking for youwhere have you been theres no time to explainjust come with me  whats this about talk to me we found the dark matter chris its real  what are you talking about dont you understand im it  its its in me the accident theyre coming for me we have todestroy this thing before they get here no you cant go back in there police im placing youunder arrest dr banton  a lot of people will die if you do this step against the wall sir im begging you i dont wanna hurt you i said step against the wall now im sorry lets go we dont have much time  chester no matter what they say to you later youre doing the right thing lock it up chris all right lets get the accelerator on line im afraid not chester  you can do it chris i can but im not no chris tell meyoure not working for them  wish i could chester you son of a bitch  careful we dont want you to hurt yourself ill die before ill let them use me youre lightning in a bottle chesterwere not about to let you die chris dont do this listen to me this is wrong youre making a terrible mistake ive got him hes not goinanywhere till you pick him up chris chris chris whats happening chris chris  mulder thats detective ryans car i was afraid of this mulder dammit whats that noise its the accelerator mulder scully look at this he must have killed herand then killed himself he couldnt have this chambersbeen sealed from the outside by who agent mulder i thought you agreednot to contact me again about this  you lied to me about about chester ray bantonyou knew who he was  and you used me to lead you to him you contacted me agent mulder i wont be your stalkinghorseor the governments you seem to be mistaken about how muchcontrol you exercise over this arrangement you killed dr banton  have you lost your mind the nurse identified you a young detective is dead because of you who do you answer to despite my loyalty to my predecessor ive never made you any promises all right promise me somethin right now promise me thisll beour last meeting were finished youre choosing a dangerous timeto go it alone agent mulder mulder i didnt kill him the mourners are invited to pay theirrespects to the family at the ryan home  how are you doin im not sure how to feel about this mulder she was my student andshe came to me for help  i know it must be hard this shouldnt have happened this never should have happened im sorry im latei got hung up at the richmond pd  doing what a missingperson report was filed by a dr morris west a physicistaffiliated with polarity magnetics im not sure i follow you dr christopher davey hasnt been seenor heard from since banton disappeared  do they have any leads no none but you do what if it wasnt banton we sawin the particle accelerator well if bantons not deadthen where is he dr davey would have been helpful to us well be studying this man for a long time i made this
