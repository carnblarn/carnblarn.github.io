questioning the legitimacy ofthe case just their motives in assigning it doesnt it bother youthat theyre undermining you they may think they arebut on the night he disappeared a woman on the i10saw a strange fire in an adjacent field i read that report she claimsthat she saw some kind of a foxfire spirit im surprised she didntcall oprah after the police  the spirits of massacred indians those are only legends well most legendsdont leave behind 12foot burn marks that was taken by state policein the field where the woman saw foxfire  this could have been made by a bonfire i thought so too until i remembered this a documentary i saw when i wasin college about an insane asylum  it gave me nightmares i thought nothing gave you nightmares i was young they uh see they took they uh they took me

supposed to ward off evil spirits can i help you folks im sheriff arensi saw you back at the turnoff fbi im special agent mulderthis is agent scully were investigatinggeorge kearnss disappearance im happy to help you but im not surehow much there is to investigate  sheriff a man is missing we found no evidence of criminal activity since no body turned upwe just filed a missing persons report why didnt you mentionthis witches peg in your report because these hillsare filled with witches pegs these old hill peoplecling tight to their superstitions  what about the scorched area illegal trash burn i keep handing out the citationsthey keep doing it anyway cheaper to pay a finethan haul it to the dump  so you dont believe its foxfire sir foxfires nothing more thana ghost story about swamp gas listen kearns was passin through townever since he got here six months ago  how do you mean never did fit in not at the plant not even in his own home  he cheated on his wife every chance he got did he have many chances george is the type of man youd expect to gochasin some sweet young thing out of town  is that what his wife thinks happened push comes to shove im sure she does but youre welcome to ask her yourself my husband had a characterthat leaves something out i always knew that about him but i didnt have the sense to do anythingabout it i guess he saved me the trouble so youre fairly certainthat he left you for somebody else george left me a long time agoright around the time i turned 40 leavin town was just a formality  do you know who he might be with now no and i dont wanna know either he was about to file this inspection reportwith the department of agriculture the day before he disappeared i know nothing about that  he never discussed his work with you he never told me and i never asked he cited several health violations he wasgonna recommend the plant be shut down i dont know a thing aboutwhat went on in that plant did he ever receive threatening phone callsor anything unusual in the mail there were hangups but i alwaysthought it was one of his girlfriends im gonna give you my phone number if your husband tries to contact youi want you to get in touch with me or if you can think of anything else come on paula lets go this is jess harold the floor managerjess these people are with the fbi youre here about george kearns his disappearance may havesomething to do with a report he was about to filewith the department of agriculture ever since he got heregeorge was trying to shut us down  he cited multiple violations i know i had to answer to each one of them was there any merit to his claims let me show you something paula are you ok this is where george worked every chickenpasses through the inspectors station weve been here 50 years and had no troublewith the usda until george came along  so he really did threaten to shut it down oh he tried but we got three other inspectors hereconsistently give us top marks here see for yourself the only problem this plant had was george problem enough to do something about if you mean any kind of unsavourinessi guess anythings possible george had a bone to pick with everyoneeven the federal government  what do you mean he filed a compensation suit claimed he was getting terrible headachesline hypnosis his lawyers called it yeah its caused byhighspeed repetitive activity i dont deny a lot of chickens go through herebut we operate within federal guidelines what happened to his lawsuit it was dismissed just a few weeksbefore he disappeared whats that oh that feed grinder chops up bone tissue see any part of the bird we cant packagewe process and use as feed  chickens feed on chickens it doesnt sound appetising but it is nutritious and cuts down on cost the meat is cooked then mixed with grainno reason to let all that protein go to waste  excuse me i got a shift change howdy sheriff logan mulder ready to admitthey sent us on a fools errand if the fool would persist in his follyhed become wise whether kearns left or was killed this couldhave been handled by any kansas city agent im not so sure about that let him go were federal agents everyone stay calm dont hurt him tell us what you want dont get excited just calm down stay calm you dont want anyone to get hurt we can talk this thing outwhy dont you give me the knife you ok do you have any idea why she attacked you  none at all no recent complaints or strange behaviour paula has always been one ofour best employees stable wellliked i cant begin to imagine what brought this on dr randolph do you have any ideas if youre done with me i got work to do come by tomorrow and let memake sure its not infected sure uh paula came by last weekcomplaining of persistent headaches she had suddenly startedgetting irritable unable to sleep  did you determine the cause im just the staff physician i usually only treat hand injuries so im a little out of my depthon psychiatric matters was anything physically wrong with her i sent her to countyfor a brain scan and an eeg both came back normal so i assumedher condition was stressrelated  could it have been line hypnosis im not qualified to make that diagnosis but you can tell us whethergeorge kearns had similar complaints they presented similar symptoms yeah  how did you treat them both with pain medicationcodeine i think an autopsy on paula graywould clarify things im uh afraid i cant authorise that  thats up to mr chaco why youre her physician yeah but mr chaco was paula graysgrandfather and her legal guardian mr chaco feedin these chickens helps me clear my mind theyre perfect creatures you know we eat their meat their eggssleep on pillows stuffed with their feathers not many people i knoware as useful as these chickens sorry to disturb you sirwe realise this is difficult for you you wanna conductan autopsy on my granddaughter why you think paula had some diseasethat made her act that way thats what were hopinga postmortem will determine i thought your businesswas kearnss disappearance it is but it may be linked withwhat happened to your granddaughter how its possible they may have both sufferedfrom the same neurological disorder you know when i came here after the wardudley was just a patch of dirt i built that plantand put my whole family to work there we made this town one of the biggestchicken processors in the nation we couldnt have done thatwith troublemakers and layabouts i assume you mean george kearns men like george kearns dont build thingsthey tend to tear em down then youre aware of his recommendationto close down your plant you know livin a long life is a mixed blessing you spend your youth trying to buildsomething for yourself and your family and your community only to watch itall taken away from you at your old age still im not ready to die just yet you go do your autopsy on paula i wanna knowwhat happened to my granddaughter i think weve got something here mulder  take a look what am i looking at a specimen from paulas brain she had a rare degenerative disordercalled creutzfeldtjakob disease its characterised by the formationof holes in the brain tissue  why didnt they show up on her charts short of an autopsy its hard to diagnose ive only seen infected tissue onceback in medical school  could it be why she attacked jess harold absolutely victims of creutzfeldtjakob suffer fromprogressive dementia severe seizures  is it fatal this girl would have been dead in months except that paula gray was no girlthis is her personnel file check it out it says here thatpaula gray was born in 1948 which means that this womanchacos granddaughter was 47 years old there must be a mistake lets find out her birth certificateshould be on file at the courthouse who knows scully this could turn outto be even more interesting than foxfire the odds that they both had the samedisease are practically nonexistent creutzfeldtjakob can be hereditarybut its not communicable that two unrelated people in one towncontracted the same rare disease is a lot more likely than paula graybeing three years shy of her 50th birthday mulder look out call an ambulance ill try to get the driver out this is federal agent scullyid like to report an accident i just got off the phone with dr randolphhe said this driver had the same symptoms youre saying this is a third victim you toldme two cases are statistically impossible they would be i just came up with a sick theory mulder ooh im listening you saw the feed grinders at the plant whatif somebody put kearnss body in there this is a prion disease so it may have passedon to the chickens and whoever ate them so anyone eating the chickenswould be at risk its possible in england they incinerate cattleto stop them passing on mad cow disease these chickensare shipped all over the country if youre right wed be seeing an epidemicnot just a few local cases sheriff whats wrong with this water runoff from the plantchicken litter mostly some blood and parts was this river searchedafter kearns disappeared are you kiddin a needle in a haystack id like it dragged as soon as possible why would you wanna do that to see whats in there thats a filthy job and i would firstlike to know what youre lookin for hopefully nothing look sheriff if you dont wanna do iti can get some of my men to do it ill do it  mulder its just a hunch if kearns didnt run offif he was murdered for that report then his bodys gotta be somewhere we closed the spillwayand the water level dropped  they came up with it almost immediately did you find kearns maybe youd better see for yourself sheriff arens is outsidetheyre still pulling bones from the river well so far ive been ableto isolate nine distinct skeletons this one belonged to the late george kearns  how do you know the pin in his femur according to his medical filekearns broke his right leg four years ago  what about the others ill need more sophisticated equipment but i estimate that some of these bonesare as much as 20 or 30 years old all of them share one strange detail though  they seem to have lost their heads besides that the older bones show signs of decayand abrasion like youd expect but for some reason all of them evenkearnss are smooth and buffed at the ends its almost like theyve been polished it could be erosion from the water well that water had hardly any current this level of erosion wouldnt be confinedto just the ends of the bones  any theories maybe sheriff  doris is it true just tell me  doris i want you to listen to me they found him didnt they we brought up quite a few remainsat the river this afternoon georges were among them im sorry listen im really sorry its gonna be all right dont worry doris well take care of you doris  dee that the new schedule yeah looks good why do i get the feelingyoure not here to check up on my neck  they found bones in the river i know i heard did you also hear that clayton walshcame down with the symptoms thats four its getting worsewith every day that goes by  someone has to tell mr chaco he knows but hes not doing anything  maybe i should talk to him you can try i will talk to him hell listen to me and if he doesnt i had danny run a check on missing personslast seen within a 200mile radius of dudley in the last 50 years87 people have disappeared near here judging from the forensic evidence id saythe same person or persons was responsible it may have been the work of a cult scully i think that the good people of dudleyhave been eating more than just chicken  you think these people were eaten look at these bones theyve been polished at both endssuggesting they were boiled in a pot anthropologists used similar evidence to prove cannibalism amongthe anasazi tribe of new mexico then paula gray may have contractedcreutzfeldtjakob by eating george kearns  that could explain her youthful appearance what are you talking about some cannibalistic ritualsare believed to prolong life cannibalism is one thingbut increasing longevity by it think about it scully from vampirismto catholicism literally or symbolically the reward for eating flesh is eternal lifei dont know how it works but we saw paula we never confirmed her date of birth maybe the courthouse records can tell us ifshe or anybody else is lying about their age you coming you gotta do something mr chaco people are gettin scaredthey dont know what to make of things theyre losing faith is what it sounds like its gettin hard to hold on tothe way things are goin  three more got sick since yesterday i lost my granddaughter in this so dont tell me what were up against now i said id handle it i know you  yes i need to see mr chaco doris i cant do this any more mr chacoi cant keep lyin its all right jess told me what happened  you have nothing to worry about but theyre gonna think i did it  no they wont think any such thing but i did  no i helped he was no good dorishe had no values he didnt fit in here  but he was my husband that was the price that you had to pay  you knew that from the beginning but those fbi agents uhuh this town wasnt built in a day its not about to fall apart in a day no youre a part of us nowand were gonna take good care of you now i want you to go home get some rest youve got a funeral to go to this whole thingll blow over soon enoughand youll wonder what all the fuss is about  im sorry thats all

contaminated chickenhas been discovered though it remains unknown how manycitizens participated in the ritual activity 27 have become fatally illwith creutzfeldtjakob disease what is known is thata transport plane carrying walter chaco was shot down in 1944 over new guinea chaco was the only survivor of that crash according to naval recordshe spent six months with the jale a tribe whose cannibalistic practiceshave long been suspected but never proven naval records also show thatwalter chaco was born in 1902 making him 93 years oldat the time of his death as of this datehis remains
