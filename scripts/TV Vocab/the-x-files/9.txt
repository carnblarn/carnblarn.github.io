                lm here in pasadena  with the nasa mission control team  as they celebrate scientific history  the first closeup photographic transmissions of mars  from the viking observer spacecraft  photos that have created a stir by revealing surprising geologic information  the presence of large amounts ofwater  locked in mars polar ice caps  water that some speculate could have possibly  sustained life on the planet  even more controversial is one image ofa land formation  a formation that looks like a sculpted human face  however nasa officials are denying it as an indication  ofan alien civilization  lts nothing more than a trick oflight and shadows  a geologic anomaly  the only sculptors at work  are the solarwinds that blow across the surface of mars  at 300 miles an hour ten months a year  lm seeing lve got  hows it going out there  theres something out here  can you repeat that commander  lts coming at me  holy god  pickup terminalsequence mps  youhaveago toproceed

l have no idea  think its a crank  lts beginning to look that way  my name is michelle generoo  fox mulder  l sentyou the note  special agent dana scully  lm sorry to have to take these precautions  l few up from houston this morning  l work at the space center there  ln what capacity  lm the mission control communications commander  for the shuttle  what brings you to washington  there may be a saboteur at work inside nasa  you have evidence ofsabotage  l dont know l may  two weeks ago  a shuttle mission was scrubbed  three seconds before liftoff  when an auxiliary power unit valve malfunctioned  lfthe fight had not been aborted  there was a great chance  the liquid fuel system and the orbiter  would have exploded on the launch pad  this was sent to me in the mail  lts a material analysis  that shows deepgrooved scoring marks  inside this apu valve  marks that could have caused a malfunction  evidence oftampering  thats what it looks like but  according to the person who gave meyour names  you have expertise  in unexplained phenomena  and whats unexplainable  is how anybody could have done it  how doyou mean  the valve is made offerrocarbon titanium  to score that material  would take extreme launch pad temperatures  lf nasa looked at that analysis  theywould say no one could do that type ofdamage undetected  doyou have any idea who sent that toyou  no idea  the official analysis ofthe malfunction  was simple mechanical failure  does anybody shareyour suspicions  lfthey do  theyre not talking to the fbl  l believe in the space program and the people who run it  but theres another launch window tomorrow  my reasons may sound selfish but my fiance  is a shuttle commander on that mission  scully whywould somebodywant to sabotage the space shuttle  well ifyou were a terrorist  there probably isnt a more potent symbol  ofamerican progress and prosperity  lfyoure an opponent ofbig science  nasa itselfrepresents a vast money trench  that exists outside the crucible and debate  ofthe democratic process  and ofcourse there are those futurists  who believe the space shuttle is a rusty old bucket  a dinosaur spacecraft built in the 70s  by scientists setting their sights on space  in an everdeclining scale  and we thought we could rest easy  with the fall ofthe soviet union  not to mention certain fringe elements  who accuse our government itself ofspace sabotage  the failure ofthe hubble telescope  and the mars observer  are directly connected to a conspiracy  to deny us evidence  evidence ofwhat  alien civilizations  oh ofcourse  look at that geminieight  what  the man were seeing colonel belt  nearly died on that mission  made an emergency landing  in the middle ofthe pacific ocean  you remember that stuff  you neverwanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid  l missed that phase  comein  colonel belt  lm special agent dana scully  and this is  colonel belt  fox mulder lm a big fan  lts an honor to meetyou  you were a big hero to me  thankyou  l stayed up all night when l was 1 4  to watch your space walk  well now its like a stroll around the block  so how can l helpyou  this found its way to the fbl  doyou recognize it  sure lts an auxiliary power unit valve  doyou have any reason to believe  that the damage done to it  was in an effort to sabotage the space shuttle program  no  any reason to suspect sabotage at all  no reason whatsoever  and ifyou have any respect for this program  and for the people who have devoted their lives to it  youll be careful to whom you make  those accusations  looking at this evidence sir  would you consider postponing the shuttle fight  until a full investigation  could be conducted  l dont know whereyou got this specious artifact  but every precaution has been taken  to rectify the problem  weve been waiting two weeks  for a window to initiate this mission  weve got a payload to deliver  has an internal investigation ever been done on this matter  the partyou have here  has been installed inspected and designed  by over 1 00 highly trained technicians  with the security measures we take  it would be virtually impossible  for one man working by himself  or two or four men  to do what youre suggesting  l can assureyou  there isnt a person in this facility  that doesnt want to see that shuttle go into space  complete its mission  and come back like winged victory herself  and in about ten hours god willing  youll seejust that  doyou think there would be a problem  with us watching the liftoff from mission control  well being thatyoud probably go over my head anyway  please be my guest  lt was an honor sir  thankyou  didntyou want to get his autograph  man where did you sayyou got this  scully lt came to us anonymously  this is an apu valve all right  this doesnt make sense  what doesnt make sense  this scoring here  this valve is made out offerrocarbon titanium  you didnt order the analysis  no but were on outside contract to nasa  they may have ordered it  wouldntyou order a material analysis  ifa part malfunctioned  every shuttle has fown with that same valve with no problem  to do an analysis would delay the program for months  not to mention the cost  ln order to avoid delays  is the program being pushed ahead  without proper safety precaution  there are about 1 7000 things  that can go wrong with the shuttle  and about 1 7000 people who make sure they dont  who makes the final determination  as to its safety  we make a recommendation  but ultimately the decision is colonel belts   thankyou  thankyou  what doyou think  l cant believe how much faith we put in machines  you think colonel belt knows more than hes saying  he lied about his knowledge ofa saboteur  l cant believe colonel belt  would endanger the lives ofthose astronauts  knowing that something might go wrong  he was an astronaut himself  soyou think this x ray is bogus  god l hope so  this is shuttle launch control  with tminus oneminute 45 andcounting  here we go  this is

rocket boosters  but we fixed it  got a phone call  communication with the shuttle had gone down  weve got to get back to houston  they have a press blackout in effect  chances are the media doesnt know about it  sabotage  things go wrong all the time  but they usually fix them  usually  shes turning  michelle  l can see her  michelle  help  you all right  lm stuck  can you move  just get me out

 you okay  yeah  orbiter this is houston  doyou copy  your transmission isbreaking up houston  whats happening  a malfin the oms and rcf systems  they cant get the orbiter into attitude rotation  cabin temperature is 1 03  and they have downlink transmission  what happened toyou  l had an accident  whats their position  just over eastern africa  try patching them into the seychelles tracking station  all right  hang in there otc  the orbiter maneuvering systems malfunctioned  they need to rotate the shuttle away from the sun  to keep the orbiter cool  drop in cabin pressure  theyre going to burn up  wheres colonel belt  on his way  on his way  what happened  backup system failed  can we autoactivate their systems from down here  we cannot  lts like someones screwing  with the uplink communications from this end  can you trace it  digital processor  theyd have to be  in the data banks  wheres that  come on  scully mulder  lm a federal agent  come on out ofthere  what areyou doing

its not enough to cool them down  cabin temperature 1 1 6  wheres  somebodysjamming our transmissions  somebody or something  is interfering with our ground communications  and scrambling our uplink telemetry  the shuttle is not responding  to override signals  lm cutting off telemetry  we might lose contact for good  we have to give it a chance  we have to bring them down  we have to give them control ofthe ship  to perform that rotation maneuver  and deliver the payload  what ifthey cant  we could be stranding them  abandon telemetry  go to fybywire mode  theyre cutting off ground control to the orbiter  the astronauts will be fying the shuttle all by themselves  ls it gonna work  otc this is houston  hows the weather up there  sunny and warm houston  whats the forecast  otc were going to fybywire mode  were going to abort ground control  to see ifyou can bring those systems back up  roger that houston  and leave the driving to us  david you take care  whatjust happened  they cut offcontact with the shuttle  generoo  lftheywere able to execute  theyd have done it by now  standing by   go to reestablish uplink communication  video signals failed  otc this is houston  doyou copy  otc this is houston  where areyou  howdydo houston  looks like we fiinally got thisbirdto flyright  otc doyou hear that  music to ourears  cabin temperature stabilizing  otc this is mark belt in

how did he know it was going to work  he didnt they could have died  and there would have been nothing  we could have done  theyd have been a ghost ship  stuck in orbit  whywould he take that risk  bring those men back without delivering that payload  thats millions ofwasted dollars  thats all congress would need to shut down nasa  belt as of2200 hours  the crew has been conducting onboard tests and tasks  and resting up for their first full day in space  lm happy to say  after a beautiful night launch  the shuttle orbiter  has performed magnificently   reportersshoutingquestions   so much foryour boyhood hero  colonel belt colonel belt  can l talk toyou for a moment  you want to know why l lied to them  youre asking yourself ifthis means  ld lie toyou  you know what it means to be an astronaut sir  you riskyour life  every timeyou get into your spacecraft  for nothing more  than the good progress ofmankind  no argument from me  youre true american heroes  heroes  we made headlines when we did ourjob right  now they buryyou in the back ofthe paper  name me two astronauts on the last shuttle  you make the front page today  only ifyou screw up  they only know your name  ifyoure the unlucky sob sitting on 500 tons ofdynamite  thats what theyre reallywaiting for  sir l have to ask  lm sorry its myjob  doyou think someone is sabotaging the shuttle  my answer toyou sir will be to bring those men back  safely to earth  oh god  hows it going out there  theres something out here  can you repeat that commander  lts coming at me holy god  houston wejustheard something weirduphere  otc houston can you describe it  sortofa dull thump likesomethingbumpedtheship  gotanyideasabout that   banging   thereitis again  pull it out  yeah  that one right there  theyve got an oxygen leak  onboard the orbiter  our o2 gaugesaregoing allscrewy houston  we got problems  weve got an o2 leak in the main tank  what happened  they dont know  theyjust said it was a thump  an astronomer in winnipeg  just spotted a gaseous cloud  a mile long trailing in our orbit  thats the liquid o2 leaking into space  this happened to colonel belt  on an apollo mission  how much time do they have  were doing the calculations  but it will be a guesstimate  l need some answers  and where is colonel belt  he was due 90 minutes ago to begin  payload deployment  houston were wondering  when wehave tostartholdingourbreath  were working on it  l need those calculations and a worstcase scenario  we dont know ifboth o2 tanks are damaged  worstcase scenario  and someone find colonel belt  well find colonel belt  theyve got 30 minutes ofbackup oxygen  why does she need belt  she doesnt know how serious the leak is  lts an oxygen leak  even l know what happens when you run out ofoxygen  colonel belts been in the same situation  hell know what to do  where the hell is he  colonel belt  colonel belt  lm going to go get security  colonel belt  areyou all right  yeah l wasnt feeling well  they need you at mission control  theres been another accident  otc  ls your orbital maneuvering system still operational  roger houston were ready forreentry justsay the word  how bads the leak  we

calculations   sniffling   scully michelle  theyre going to die  you dont know that  lts unconscionable  putting that payload before those mens lives  l think shes right  hes losing it  he saved their lives earlier  did he or did he put their lives injeopardy  lfhe cant deliver that payload  congress kills the space program  killing astronauts wont have the same effect  l think somebody must have sabotaged the space shuttle  l think colonel belt has known about it from the beginning  weve got to stop him  weve got to pull them out oforbit  he doesnt want those men to die  he put them up there  he may be the only person who can get them down alive  how can you be certain that what hes doing  wont save their lives  l need access toyour records  in a hurry  mulder l need everything on the

must have seen out there in space  the doctors who examined him  said he was experiencing severe dementia  l dont think he ever really knew  exactly how it was working through him  or that he ever knew  that he was  responsible for his own actions  he ordered those x rays ofthe damaged parts  l think he was trying to warn her  l think that he sent michelle those x rays  like he was trying to reach out to her  without quite knowing why  as ifhis own instinctual impulse  was to save those men  while simultaneously trying to kill them  scully we send those men up into space  to unlock the doors ofthe universe  and we dont even know whats behind them  l thinkwhatever it was he took it with him  and in the end that was  the onlyway he knew how to stop it  theres an investigation you know  they havent ruled out foul play  he gave his own life  he was an astronaut that was something he was prepared to do  colonel marcus aurelius belt devoted his life  to the exploration and
