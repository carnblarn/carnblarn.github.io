said out ofthe vehicle  keepyour hands down  lets see some ld  no not until i seeyours  screams  last time you were that engrossed  it turned outyou were reading the adult video news  i didnt think youd be in today  how areyou dana   dana  im fine thankyou  what areyou working on  two days ago a couple was kidnapped atjackson university  elizabeth hawley andjames summers both 1 9  lastyear another couple was kidnapped to the day  except that abduction occurred at duke university  one week later they found both students bodies dead  theywere kept alive tortured during that period  no arrests were made police believed it to be a onetime offender  now it appears to be a serial incident  ifhe holds true to form we have five days to find those kids  thats a grim deadline  heres another grim deadline  in one week luther lee boggs will take a seat  in the north carolina gas chamber  how is he related  he claims to have information  he described hawleys bracelet down to the last detail  this is information only family members could have known  or the kidnapper  boggs feels that ifhis talents help save these kids  then his sentence should be reduced to life in prison  his talents  he claims to have obtained this information  through psychic transmissions  mulder do i detect a hint ofskepticism  perhaps  boggs has been there before in the chamber  my profile helped send him there  he was actually strapped to the chair  before receiving an executive stay  he claims that this experience activated in him  the ability to channel spirits and demons  i believe in psychic ability without a doubt  but not in this case not boggs  soyou believe boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from the inside  a scam to save his life  at the age ofsix luther boggs  slaughtered every pet animal in his housing project  when he was 30 he strangled five family members overthanksgiving dinner  and then sat down to watch the fourth quarter ofthe detroitgreen bay game  some killers are products ofsociety  some act out past abuses  boggs kills because he likes it  and theyve requested you speakwith him  actually hes requested to speak to me   whyyou  he read my profile on him  and he feels like im the only one who truly understands what he is  anyway i leave for raleigh this afternoon  ill go with you  the funeral is at noon  i thinkyou should take some time  i need to work  im sorry aboutyour father   ill seeyou later  okay  as a captain he was entitled to burial in arlington  with full ceremony  this is exactly the way he wanted it  just the family   beyond the sea plays  this song was playing when his ship returned from the cuban blockade  he marched right offup to me  and he proposed  i know thatyou and dad were disappointed  that i chose the path im on instead ofmedicine  but i need to know  was he at all proud ofme  he was your father  the soul of luther boggs  drowns in hells sea offire  we have him now  we  you mean the souls ofyourvictims  the dead  the living  all souls are connected  and youre the conduit  labored breathing  uh dana  fox  please understand that from here  we can return to the past  we can see the present we can know the future  from here  where exactly areyou  mr boggs must be made redemptive  for his transgressions  thats what the state of north carolina  intends to do next week  uhuh  lets deal  boggs life for the kids you know what im saying  firstyouve got to prove youre telling the truth  dont get me wrong luther  i want to believe  groaning  oh  oh  god no  must stop  stop stop stop stop  pain  pain terrible pain  um the boy  uhjim  uh hes tied with twine  uh packing twine  grunting  he whips them with a coat hanger  a wire coat hanger  oh  dark place  cold  a cellar  warehouse condemned  an angel ofstone  waterfall  water falling  not a waterfall not water  theyre there  oh god i got to go  i got to go i got to go  i tore this off my new york knicks tshirt  it has nothing to do with the crime   somewhere beyond the sea    somewhere waiting for me   gasps  did you get my message starbuck  scully whats wrong  did boggs say something toyou  no  its my father im sorry im sorry  thats all right  why dontyou go back to the motel  weve exposed boggs as a fraud  boggs is not what he claims to be  he may be orchestrating the kidnapping  now he knows were onto him he doesnt have a chance with the charade  im going to wait for a couple hours and try to interrogate him  hopefully hell tell me where the kids are   somewhere    beyond the shore   well kiss just as before    happywell be   water falling not a waterfall  an angel ofstone  knock on door  its mulder  i just heard that liz hawleys family made a positive ld  on the charm you found at the warehouse  the police are searching that place inch by inch  but they havent been able to find anything yet  i expected to find you at the crime scene  did boggs confess  no no it was five hours of boggs channeling  after three hours i asked him to summon up the soul ofjimi hendrix  and requested all along the watchtower  you know the guys been dead 20 years but he still hasnt lost his edge  i lied to the police about how i found the warehouse  i didnt notice any suspicious activities  then how did you find it  it was where boggs said it would be   scully i told you about boggs  i didnt go looking for it  i came across an area that had landmarks he spoke of  thats exactly what boggs wanted  he could have been setting you up you could be dead right now  why did you feel you had to lie on your police report  i thought it would be a better explanation  under the circumstances  no you didnt want to go on record  admitting thatyou believed in boggs  the bureau would expect something like that from spooky mulder  but not dana scully  i thought thatyou would be pleased  that id opened myself to extreme possibilities  why now  after all weve seen why boggs  does this have to do with your father  he said that he didnt approve ofyou becoming an fbi agent  ifbeing on thejob now makes you feel guilty  or uncomfortable or uneasy i thinkyou should back away  because ifits clouding yourjudgment  youre putting yourself in danger  i love thisjob  you loveyour father  dana  open yourselfup to extreme possibilities  onlywhen theyre the truth  that goes for luther boggs and your father  as for luther boggs  hes the greatest oflies  i know hes working with someone on the outside  and they planted that evidence  we have to be very careful about plotting our next move  because hes planned five steps ahead  the only advantage we have is time  scully look at this  thats incredible they found them  thats exactly what i want boggs to think  why didnt the police notify us  they havent been found the article is bogus  the carolinian made this up for us  only six people know about it  today boggs gets his weekly phone privileges  hopefully hell call his accomplice to find out what happened  phone privilege is in two hours  boggs dialing  go  phone rings  turn offthat phone   ringing  turn it off  mulder its you  ringing   mulder  how comeyou dont believe me  agent scully does  she believes me  agent scully believes what we all believe  thatyou have the kids  now where are they  mulder even ifhe is setting us up  we have to follow because in three days  liz hawley andjim summers will be dead  then a day later our only connection to the case  will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber  we have to deal  breathing heavily  the kidnapper is aroused by the prospect ofbecoming a killer  whats the name  cant see male  describe him  small  thin  iate twenties  skull human skull  silver gray  his eyes  cold very cold  staring at elizabeth  god hes got the wire  no  please no  where is he  hes over  by the window  holding back his  holding back his thoughts ofkilling us  waiting  theres a small boathouse on lakejordan  you got that  mulder  dont go near the white cross  we seeyou down  and your blood spills on the white cross  muffed cries  sweep the docks   federal agent  gunshot  mulder  we need an ambulance officer down  what do we got  its a throughandthrough upper femur  cant palpate a radial pulse  okay i want a bp lets get him on the gurney  nurse blood pressure is 67 on palpation  doctor okay tighten and screen him for six  i want two liters ofsaline in now  and give him two units ofoneg after the typing  lets transfer now  liz no  no  no  man lucasjackson henry 28  did some time at angola in louisiana  for sexual assault narcotics  nothing big really  his personal history includes being witness to an auto accident  in which his high school sweetheart was killed and his motherwas decapitated  the sevenyear anniversary  ofthat accident is in three days  hes reliving it  that would explain the deadline  the most important element we found is theres suspicion  that luther lee boggs last five murders  were committed with a partner  now the police in durham say they could never prove it in court  but they know that partner was lucas henry  you set us up  youre in on this with lucas henry  this was a trap for mulder because he helped putyou away  well i came here to tell you  that ifhe dies because ofwhat youve done four days from now  nobodywill stop me from being the one that will throw the switch  and gas you out ofthis life for good you son ofa bitch  dana  youre the one that believed me  no  no i do not believeyou  ifyou dont believe me maybeyoull believeyourself  there was that one time when i was 1 4  and my parents had gone to bed and i snuck downstairs alone  got one ofmy moms cigarettes  and went out onto the porch in the dark  i was so scared  my heart was beating  theywould have killed me ifthey knew  but i was so excited  not cause ofthe cigarette  it was gross  but because i wasnt supposed to  that could be a moment from any kids life  i know whatyou want  and i know who you want to talk to  why dontyoujust go ahead and ask me  ill believeyou  ifyou let me talk to him  starbuck  no no no  nobody talks to anybody until i get a deal  dont underestimate my fear ofdying  and dont downplay my terror ofgoing back to that chair  i know my hells going to be  to go back to that chair over and over again for all oftime  but in this life my one and only life  i dont everwant to go back again ever  the last time i went to deaths door  and looked inside  i had never talked to a minister before  in my life ever until that day  and he said  he who doth not love  remains in death  and he who hates his brother is a murderer  and no murderer has eternal life  abiding in him  my family who i killed after their last meal  was right there to watch me over mine  and their fear  and their horror  that i made them feel when i killed them  was injected into me  and their collective fear alone  wasjust one taste ofhell  and i felt myself leave my body  i thought theyd already killed me  and i saw thousands  ofsouls rushing into my body  it is a cold dark place scully  mulders looking in on it right now  it may be a cold dark place foryou  but its not for mulder and its not for my father  im sure hed like to tell you hisself  but im not going to let him  nobody speaks until you get me a deal  i dont believeyou  oh well theres plenty ofroom  in that cold dark place for liars scully  you go ahead and play it likeyou need to  but i knowyou believe me  but ifyou need to convince ajudge im in on it with lucas  go ahead cause eitherway  whether im running the show with lucas or im channeling  no informations coming until i get a deal  i got nothing to lose  guard  ifl die  that boy goes to that cold dark place  man this supreme court  will not make a deal with a mass murderer  especially one who i know is orchestrating  a capital offense two days before his capital punishment  yes sir  the only thing boggs will get from me is a timely death  its an overdue one at that  were running out oftime  theres still no sign of lucas henry  orjim summers  the raleigh police said  no matterwhat dont believe him  boggs created this whole charade to get back at me  for putting him on death row  youd be the next best thing  mulder i never thought id say this  but what iftheres another explanation  dont deal with him  he could be trying to claim you  as his last victim  all right mr boggs  you gotyour deal  thankyou maam  thankyou  all right where are they  exhaling loudly  uh i  uh  i see like uh  uh circles  uh  i dont know like barrels  no no bigger  like uh  huge uh vats uh  factory  uh condemned  the old  uh blue devil brewery  up by morrisville  oh god hes getting uh hes getting ready  he he  hes getting ready to um  um  hes getting ready to kill the d  whoo  luther ifyou really were psychic  i would have known you lied  that there neverwas a deal  i knowyou tried  scully  avoid the devil  dont follow henry to the devil  leave that to me  screaming  groaning  water dripping  agent freeze  federal agents were armed  dropyourweapon  gunshot  heaving  go  ow  grunting  you come to say goodbye  i believe  that ifyou had orchestrated this kidnapping  lucas henrywould have been aware ofthe danger  you warned me about  he neverwould have crossed that bridge  soyou saved jim summers life  butyou saved mine as well  you come for some unfinished business  you want your fathers message  not now  be there tonight  mywitness  and when they got me in that chair and they  open up that shield  you getyour message  breathing heavily  our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name  thy kingdom come thywill be done on earth as it is in heaven  would you like to make a statement  and forgive us our trespasses  as we forgive those that trespass against us  and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  forthine is the kingdom the power and the glory  forever and ever amen  i was considering boggs  ifhe knew that i was your partner  he could have found out everything he knew about me about my father  scully   beyond the sea was playing at my parents wedding  visions ofdeceased loved ones are a common psychological phenomena   ifhe knew that my father  dana  after all youve seen after all the evidence  why cantyou believe  im afraid  im afraid to believe  you couldnt face that fear  even ifit meant never knowing whatyour fatherwanted to tell you  but i do know  how  he was my father
