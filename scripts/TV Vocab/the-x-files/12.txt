expectyou  before supper  screaming  man put it out put it out  i forgot what its like  to spend a day in court  thats one ofthe luxuries  to hunting down aliens and genetic mutants  you rarely get to press charges  its opened  what  its unlocked  thats weird  im sure i locked it  must be an xfile  chuckling  whats that  i told you i locked the door  what doyou think it is  ten to one you cant dance to it  woman greetings agent mulder  six months ago british minister of parliament reggie ellicott  received an audiocassette much like the oneyoure listening to now  unfortunately when he popped the tape into the car stereo  he armed a device which when he tried to exit the car  created an explosion which was heard five miles away  the scotland yard forensic team could only identify  the poor bastard by his dental records  ifonly he hadnt reached for the door handle  and triggered the detonator  but then how was he to know  he was sitting on enough plastique explosive  to lift the car 40 feet in the air  and deposit the engine block  on top ofa threestory building  gasps  gasps  arent we looking rather ghostly  its an old friend  arentyou going to thank me  forwhat  saving your life  one tends not to make the same mistake twice  ill try to remember that  oh come on dont tell meyou left  your sense ofhumor in oxford ten years ago  no actually its one ofthe few things  you didnt drive a stake through  some mistakes are quite worth making twice  dana scully this is phoebe greene  the terror ofscotland yard  hello  hello  she hates me  what brings you to the colonies  some clever bloke has been giving  the aristocracy a good scare  killed offa ranking member of parliament or three  set windsor castle ablaze in 92  your car bomber  no this one likes to burn his victims alive  cant figure out how he does it  not a crumb ofevidence at the crime scene  the last one died in his front garden  his pooryoung wife watching helplessly  as he went up in smoke  the lrish republican army  our suspect likes to send love letters  to his victims wives  sent one to the wife of sir malcolm marsden a month ago  three days later  he narrowly escaped a fire in his garage  burned to the ground  so theyre renting a place out on cape cod  bringing the family to the states  for an extended holiday  or until we catch the dirty bugger  hes that determined  judging by his success he takes  certain delight in his work  so what brings you on this detour  to washington dc lnspector  i figured my friend mulder  couldnt resist a threepipe problem  ill run it by our arson specialist  splendid  ill call london let them know  oh goodbye  threepipe problem  thats from sherlock holmes its a privatejoke  how private  um  we knew each other in school in england  she was brilliant  and i got in over my head and paid the price  mulder youjust keep unfolding like a fower  that was over ten years ago scully  yeah i noticed  howyou couldnt drop everything fast enough  in order to help her out  i was merely extending her a professional courtesy  oh is that whatyou were extending  im going to run this by the arson guys  and then shes on her own  something tells me  youre not going to get rid ofher that easily  beautiful ohjust beautiful  look at that  salmon red fames  this is 1 4001 500 degrees  this is a work ofart  was there any kind ofincendiary device used  yes actually the victims body  spontaneous combustion  he was murdered  however weve turned up no evidence  that tells us how the body caught fire  thats peculiar  people dont normally just catch on fire  i mean we burn but we dont conduct that well  theres usually some extraneous fuel involved  iike candle wax gasoline  something fammable and incendiary  that adheres to the skin  like an accelerant  like an accelerant yes  weve found nothing save for a dusting ofmagnesium  thats aliphatic pyrolysis  its a residue from an exothermic reaction  but theres no evidence ofthe source  no pour pattern or ignition devices  there have been some arson fires in seattle and pennsylvania  it burns so hot that the firemen cant put them out   hosing that down makes it worse  hows that  the reaction is so intense  that it splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen  itjust adds fuel to the fire  what were they using  we dont know for sure it could be rocket fuel  it burns so hot and clean  theres never a trace left  its very difficult to prove arson  its driving the insurance companies nuts  its about the only explanation that i can giveyou  there have been cases ofpyrokinetics  people who can control and conduct fire  well ive seen fire bend around corners  seen it bounce like a rubber ball  fire has got a certain genius you know  a certain demon poetry  its like its got a mind ofits own  but ive never seen one  that can defy the laws ofphysics  not when you figure it out  youve uh  got quite a case foryourselfhere mulder  i almost wish i could be in your shoes  car approaching  heyjackson  boy thats a nice house  what a pleasant surprise  welcome to america sir malcolm  man from the top there hand them down  marsden thankyou im delighted to be here  wheres the

game  what areyou talking about  theres something else  i havent told you about myself scully  sighs  i hate fire hate it  scared to death ofit  sighs  when i was a kid  my best friends house burned down  had to spend the night in the rubble  to keep away looters  foryears i had nightmares  about being trapped in a burning building  wait phoebe knows about this  this is classic phoebe greene mind game player extraordinaire  ten years its taken me to forget her  and she shows up with this case  she shows up knowing the power she has overyou  and then makes you walk through fire  phoebe is fire  mulder areyou sureyou dont want me to helpyou out  sooner or later a mans got to face his demons  coughing  coughing  hello youre the marsdens driver  whos that  bob caretaker  oh  bum a smoke  yeah sure  im going into town can i getyou anything  yeah some cough medicine  syrup or lozenges  syrup would be good  can i giveyou some money  appreciate that  beer  they dont letyou bring your own around here  british accent well i guess theyll just have to make an exception  wont they  oh youre english  god i just love that accent  allow me  and a gentleman to boot  oh my god  now that is a trick  hey guys  take a look at this  care for a light  screaming  i pulled this report offthe wire  eyewitnesses are saying  that a customer in the bar caught fire  theyre looking for a body  any indication an accelerant was used  the bars across from a fire station  it burned to the ground before they could even respond  it burned so hot  it turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake  this woman was in the bar  hello  hello  miss patrick  im special agent mulder from the fbi  this is lnspector greene  can you tell us what happened in the bar last night  there was this guy  id had a few drinks so  he sat next to me and he did this thing  it was like a magic trick  where he lit his finger on fire  next thing i turned around he was up in fames  can you describe him  goodlooking i think  brownish hair  long hair short hair  i gave the police the information  doyou thinkyou could work with a composite artist  i had a few drinks  can i getyour full name and address  see  i live with someone he thinks i was at school last night  its no problem you can come down  to the office and workwith somebody there  ill giveyou a minute to think about it okay  deftly done agent mulder  casually disregard her indiscretion  firm but polite manner until she accedes to cooperate  its a technique i refined in my relationship with you  oh i seeyou havent lost your sense ofhumor after all  im sorry that was a cheap shot  i dont want to dredge up the past  letsjust stick to the case  lets  look  unless im mistaken  ten years seems sufficient time to have forgiven  ifnot forgotten a fewyouthful indiscretions  im cursed with a photographic memory  then dontyou tell me thatyouve forgotten  a certain youthful indiscretion  atop sirarthur conan doyles tombstone  on a misty night in windlesham  like i said letsjust stick to the case  it occurred to me that were going to a lot oftrouble  to find a description ofa man who in all likelihood  has been burned to a crisp  i would agree with you but they havent found a bodyyet  so can we count on you  yeah okay  thanks  i dont know ifit matters  but i remembered something else about the guywho caught fire  he had an english accent  coughing  having a rough time huh  maybe its the cough syrup  scully after reviewing the files ofthe scotland yard arson murders  two points remain unexplained  one is the use of an untraceable accelerant  the other involves the victims  since they all burned in the presence offamily members  in safe surroundings  this indicates unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist  the arsonist is most likely a male less than 25 years ofage  he will often act out ofimpulse  satisfying sexual urges or insecurities  with destructive behavior which compensates  for his social inadequacies or maladjustments  you boys want to see a magic trick  okay  whats your names  michael andjimmie  doesnt he talk  yes  what kind ofmagic trick  maybe id better not  show us  you might tell your parents  we wont  really promise  promise  hope to die stick a needle in your eye  okay boys  youve taken the solemn oath that cant be broken  except under penalty  ofdeath  watch  is it in there  no  youre too smart for me  where did it go  where doyou think  i dont know  i think i remember  grunting  tada  ooh  do it again  okay ill do it again  knocking  agent beatty  im special agent dana scully  can i steal a minute ofyour time  sure im just working  on this mafia torchjob here  im working with agent mulder  oh yeah wild case  so what can i do foryou  you mentioned that the arsonist might be using  some kind ofrocket fuel as an accelerant  it still doesnt explain how he sets bodies on fire  what ifhe got some ofthis fuel into some hand cream or  well youve got to understand  even the smallest amounts ofthis stuff  can produce temperatures over 5000 degrees  but i suppose its not impossible  extremely diluted  butyou still have to find a way to ignite it  wow it lit by itself  come on sit down  so you guys ever smoked a cigarette  no theyre bad foryou  would you like to take a puff  no  make a man out ofyou  i dont want to  why dontyou hold one for me  how aboutyoujimmie  huh little man  womanjimmie michael  hello bob  thereyou are  weve had a bit ofbad news  our driver has taken ill  and were due at a party in boston this evening  is there any chance that we can impose upon you  to drive the family into town  we would payyou foryour time and putyou up for the night  id be happy to do it as a favor  thankyou  boys lets go daddys got lunch ready  jimmie youre filthy  scully the arsonist is usually unmarried  and prone to obsessive fantasies about women or men  who are inaccessible to him  often the setting offires results from his cowardice  and inability to develop a natural relationship  his crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned  the suspicious nature ofthe fire last night  strongly suggests the arsonist has followed lord marsden  to the united states  a check ofrecent immigration to the northeastern area  is underway  it has become not a matter ofif but when he will strike  man heres that immigration data you wanted  thankyou  youre welcome  remember those reports about people  who control and conduct fire pyrokinetics  vaguely  i think this guy sent us a message that hes more exotic  i should say so ifhe can set himselfafire   laughs  what  im just not used to someone so quick to agree with me  what protection does the family have  the drivers a very capable bodyguard  he should get additional men and limit public exposure  theyve got a party in their honor tonight in boston  theyll have to cancel  unless you wanted to set a trap  i had thought ofthat  but we must be careful and discreet  the partys at 800 at the venable plaza  ill be traveling with the family  so why dontyou go ahead and look around  ive taken a room at the hotel for the night  thanks  good night thankyou  phone ringing  mulder

to showyou  yeah  well i did some checking on my own  i didnt know a whole lot about arson or arsonists  so i took the opportunity  for my own edification ofcourse  i ran a profile ofpossible incendiary fuels  and accelerants that could have been used in the crimes  i also took the liberty  ofrunning a search through lnterpol  ofall the gardeners manservants and domestic help  that were hired by the murdervictims  at the time oftheir deaths  and  these people probably dont even tie their own shoes  there were over 200 names  and not a duplicate except one  a cecil lively  he worked as a gardener for two ofthe victims  and what did you find on him  nothing  so hes clean  he was questioned by scotland yard  and they released him but i dug a little further  cecil lively is a documented citizen  ofgreat britain paid his taxes  never been on the dole a model citizen  until he died in 1 971 in a london tenement fire  i know thats what i thought  so i checked a little further  cecil llvely spelled  l apostrophe came up again  in fact it came up twice  first on a list ofdeath certificates  iisted among a group ofchildren who died in ritual sacrifice  by a satanic cult in 1 963  in the tottingham woods outside bath england  where else did you find it  youre going to love this  on a list ofrecent visas  issued by the british government  cecil llvelys passport  was stamped

the file opened by special agent mulder  the arson suspect cecil llvely was admitted to boston mercy hospital  with fifth and sixth degree burns over his entire body  military burn specialists  have been brought in to study the case  which theyre calling extraordinary  not only for the fact the suspect survived  but for the rapid regeneration ofhis basal cell tissue  full recovery is anticipated in as little as a month  scully llvely is being held  in a highsecurity medical facility  confined to a hyperbaric chamber  until he can be tried on murder charges  in the death ofa massachusetts caretaker  his body temperature remains at a steady 1 09 degrees  health technicians have removed  anything fammable from his room  due to several fires which have broken out in the vicinity
