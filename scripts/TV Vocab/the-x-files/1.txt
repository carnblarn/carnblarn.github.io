thankyou for coming on such short notice  please  youve been with us just over twoyears  yes sir  you went to medical school butyou chose not to practice  how did you come to work for the fbl  well sir l was recruited out ofmedical school  my parents still think it was an act ofrebellion  but l saw the fbl  as a place where l could distinguish myself  areyou familiar with an agent named fox mulder  yes l am  how so  by reputation  hes an oxfordeducated psychologist  who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult  that helped catch monty propps in 1 988  generally thought of as the best analyst  in the violent crime section  he had a nickname at the academy  spooky mulder  lll also tell you that agent mulder  has developed a consuming devotion  to an unassigned project  areyou familiarwith the socalled xfiles  l believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena  we wantyou to assist mulder  you will write field reports on your activities  along with your observations on the validity ofthe work  you want me to debunk the xfiles project  we trustyoull make the proper analysis  youll want to contact agent mulder shortly  we look forward to seeing your reports  sorry nobody down here  but the fbls most unwanted  agent mulder  lm dana scully  lve been assigned to workwith you  lsnt it nice to be so highly regarded  who did you tick off  to get stuckwith this detail  actually lm looking forward to working with you  l was under the impression thatyou were sent to spy on me  lfyou have any doubt about my qualifications  youre a medical doctor  you teach at the academy  you did your undergraduate degree in physics   einsteins twin paradox a new lnterpretation  dana scullys senior thesis  now thats a credential rewriting einstein  did you read it  l did l liked it  ln most ofmywork  the laws ofphysics  rarely seem to apply  maybe l can get your medical opinion on this  oregon female age 21   no explainable cause ofdeath  autopsy shows nothing zip  there are however these two distinct marks  on her lower back  dr scully can you ld these marks  needle punctures maybe  an animal bite electrocution  hows your chemistry  this is the substance found in the surrounding tissue  lts organic  l dont know  ls it some kind ofsynthetic protein  beats me  lve never seen it either  but here it is again  in south dakota and again in texas  doyou have a theory  l have plenty oftheories  but maybe what you can explain to me  is why its bureau policy  to label these cases unexplained phenomena  and ignore them  doyou believe in the existence ofextraterrestrials  logically l would have to say no  given the distances needed  to travel from  the far reaches ofspace  the energy requirements would exceed  a spacecrafts capabilities  conventional wisdom this oregon female  shes the fourth person in her graduating class  to die under mysterious circumstances  when convention and science  offer us no answers  might we not finally turn to the fantastic  as a plausibility  the girl obviously died ofsomething  lfit was natural causes its plausible  there was something missed in the postmortem  lfshe was murdered  its plausible there was a sloppy investigation  what l find fantastic is any notion  that there are answers beyond the realm ofscience  the answers are there  you have to know where to look  thats why they put the l in fbl  seeyou tomorrow morning scully bright and early  we leave for the very plausible state oforegon  at 800 am  pilot ld like to ask all passengers to fasten their seat belts  as were about to make our descent  this must be the place  you didnt mention yesterday  this case has already been investigated  yeah the fbl got involved after the first three deaths  when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence  our boys came out here spent a week  enjoyed the local salmon  which isjust to die for ifyou pardon the expression  without explanation theywere called back in  the case was reclassified  and buried in the xfiles until l dug it up last week  and you found something they didnt  the autopsy reports of the first three victims  show no unidentified marks or tissue samples  but those reports were signed by a different medical examiner  than the latest victim  thats pretty good scully  better than you expected or better than you hoped  well lll letyou know when we get past  the easy part  ls the medical examiner a suspect  we wont know until we do some grave digging  lve arranged to exhume one ofthe othervictims  to see ifwe can get a tissue sample  to match the girls  youre not squeamish areyou  lve never had the pleasure  indistinct radio  audio feedback  whats going on  what the hell was that about  oh you know  probably nothing  mr mulder county coroners office  yeah hi  this is agent scully  how soon can we get started  were ready to go  wereyou able to arrange for an examination facility  man excuse me  excuse me no  please stay in  l dont know

missed something in those kids exams  were not insinuating anything sir  wait a minute  well l thinkyou are  lfyoure making an accusation  youd better have something to back it up  daddy please letsjust go home  lets go home please  guy obviously needed a longervacation  ray soames was the third victim  after graduating high school  he spent time in a state mental hospital  treated for postadolescent schizophrenia  soames confessed to the first two murders  he pleaded to be locked up  but he couldnt produce any evidence  that he committed the crimes  did you read the cause ofdeath  exposure his body was found in the woods  after escaping the hospital  missing for only seven hours injuly  how does a 20yearold die ofexposure  on a warm summer night in oregon  this isnt official procedure  really  lts probably a safe bet ray soames never made  the varsity basketball team  seal this up right now  nobody sees or touches this nobody  this is amazing scully  doyou know what this could mean  lts almost too big to even comprehend  the subject is 1 56 centimeters in length  weighing 52 pounds in extremis  corpse is in advanced stages ofdecay  and desiccation  distinguishing features include large ocular cavities  oblique cranium indicates subject is not human  could you point that fash away from me  lfits not human what is it  lts mammalian  lts a chimpanzee or something from the ape family  possibly an orangutan  buried in the city cemetery in rays grave  try telling that to the good townsfolk  or to rays family  l want tissue samples x rays blood typing toxicology  and a full genetic workup  what we cant do here well order to go  you dont honestly believe this is an extraterrestrial  this is somebodys sickjoke  ls there any reason we cant do those x rays right now  lm not crazy scully  l have the same doubts you do  scully visual laboratory inspection ofthe body and xray analysis  confirms homologous but possibly mutated  mammalian physiology  however does not account for small unidentified object  found in subjects nasal cavity  a grey metallic implant forming  knocking  who is it  steven spielberg  lm going for a run  want to come  pass  figure out what that little thing is  no and lm not  losing any sleep over it  good night  ray soames was a patient ofmine  l oversaw his treatment for over a year  for clinical schizophrenia  ray had an inability to grasp reality  he seemed to suffer from some kind ofposttraumatic stress  ls that something youve seen before  lve treated similar cases  were any ofthose ray soames classmates  yes  were trying to find a connection in these deaths  did you treat any ofthese kids with hypnosis  no l did not  areyou treating any ofthese kids now  currently  yes lm treating billy miles and peggy odell  theyre here at this hospital  going on fouryears now  would it be possible to talk to them  well you might find it difficult  certainly in billy miles case  billys experiencing what we call a waking coma  functionally his brain waves are fat  how did it happen  he and peggywere involved in an automobile accident  doctor peggy  we have some visitors  would you talkwith them  billywants me to read

those marks  l dont thinkyoure ready forwhat l think  lm here to solve this case  l want the truth  l think those kids have been abducted  bywho  bywhat  you dont really believe that  doyou have a better explanation  lll buy that girl is suffering  some kind ofpronounced psychosis  whether its organic or the result ofthose marks  l cant say  but to say that theyve been riding around in fying saucers  there is nothing to support that  nothing scientific you mean  there has got to be an explanation  youve got fourvictims  all ofthem died in or near the woods  they found karen swensons body in the forest in her pajamas  ten miles from her house  how did she get there  what were those kids doing out there in the forest  mechanicalhumming  mulder  mechanicalhum increasing  mulder is

time  get in your car and leave  whats he doing out here all by himself  maybe it has something to do with this  what doyou think it is  l dont know  ls it a campfire  lt was all over the ground  l

mulder  yeah lm just uh  what areyou looking for  what happened  we lost power  brakes steering everything  we lost nine minutes  whoo  we lost what  nine minutes  l looked at mywatch just before the fash  and it was 903  ltjust turned 91 3  look  look  oh yes  abductees  people that have made ufo sightings  theyve reported unexplained time loss  come on  gone  just like that  no wait a minute

mulder what are they  mosquito bites  areyou sure  yeah l got eaten up a lot myselfout there  you okay  yes  youre shaking  l need to sit down  takeyour time  l was 1 2 when it happened  my sisterwas eight  shejust disappeared out ofher bed one night  just gone vanished  no note no phone calls no evidence ofanything  you never found her  lt tore the family apart  no one would talk about it  there were no facts to confront  nothing to offer any hope  what did you do  eventually l went off to school in england  l came back got recruited by the bureau  seems l had a natural aptitude  for applying behavioral models to criminal cases  my success allowed me a certain freedom  to pursue my own interests  and thats when l came across the xfiles  by accident  at first it looked  like a garbage dump  for ufo sightings alien abduction reports  the kind ofstuffthat most people laugh at as being ridiculous  but l was fascinated  l read all the cases l could get my hands on hundreds ofthem  l read everything l could about paranormal phenomenon  about the occult and  what  theres classified government information  lve been trying to access  but someone has been blocking my attempts to get at it  who l dont understand  someone at a higher level ofpower  the only reason  lve been allowed to continue is because lve made  connections in congress  theyre afraid ofwhat  thatyoull leak this information  youre part ofthat agenda you know that  lm not a part ofany agenda  youve got to trust me  lm herejust likeyou to solve this  lm telling you this scully becauseyou need to know  because ofwhatyouve seen  ln my research lve worked very closelywith a man  named dr heinz werber  hes taken me through deep hypnosis  lve been able to go into my own repressed memories  to the night my sister disappeared  l can recall a bright light outside  and a presence in the room  l was paralyzed  unable to respond to my sisters calls for help  listen to me scully  this thing exists  how doyou know  the government knows about it  and l got to know what theyre protecting  nothing else matters to me  and this is as close as lve ever gotten to it  phoneringing  hello  what  who is this  who is th  that was some woman  and she said peggy odell was dead  the girl in the wheelchair  man yeah lll bring it over in a minute  what happened  she ran right out in front ofme  who areyou  she was running  on foot  well thatsjust  lets go lets go  someone trashed the lab and stole the body  were going back to the motel  what they stole the corpse  fbl  there goes my computer  damn it the x rays and pictures  man l need a couple ofmen out here  well need a light safety curtain  my name is theresa nemman  youve got to protect me  come with us  this is the way it happens  l dont know how l get out there  lll just find myself out in the woods  how long has it been happening  ever since the summerwe graduated  lts happened to my friends too  thats why l need you to protect me  lm scared l might die  like the others  like peggy did tonight  your fathers the medical examiner  you were the one  on the phone  you told me  peggy odell had been killed  theresa your father knows about this doesnt he  about what happens  yes  but he said never to tell  anyone about any ofit  why  he wants to protect me  he thinks he can protect me but l dont think he can  doyou have the marks theresa  yes  lm going to die arent l  lm going to be next  no youre not going to die  oh god  lets go home theresa  theresa come on  come on honey  l dont think she wants to leave  l dont care whatyou think

 thats right and you stay away from that boy  you got to love this place  every day is like halloween  they know mulder  they know whos responsible for the murders  they know something  dr nemmans been hiding medical evidence  from the beginning  he lied on the autopsy reports  now we find out about the detective  who would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms  whywould they destroy evidence  what would theywant with that corpse  l dont know  makes you wonderwhats in those other two graves  theyre both empty  what is going on here  l think l know who did it  l think l know who killed karen swenson  who  the detective  the detectives son  billy miles  the boy in the hospital  the vegetable  billy miles  a boy in a coma for the last fouryears  dug up these graves  peggy odell was bound to a wheelchair  but ran in front ofthat truck  lm not making this up  lt fits the profile ofalien abduction  this fits a profile  peggy odell was killed at 900  thats right around the time we lost nine minutes  something happened in that nine minutes  time as we know it stopped  and something took control over it  you think lm crazy  what  peggy odells watch stopped a couple ofminutes after nine  l made a note ofit when l saw the body  the kids come to the forest because the forest controls them  and the marks are from some kind oftests  thats being done on them  and that maybe causes some kind ofgenetic mutation  which would explain the body that we dug up  and the force summoned theresa nemmans body  into the woods tonight  yes but it was billy miles who took her there  summoned by some alien impulse  thats it  come on  lets get out ofhere  where are we going  to pay a visit to billy miles  nurse now we could stand here until the second coming  waiting for billy to get out ofthis bed  lt aint going to happen  he blinks and l know about it  l guess you changed his bedpan last night  nobody else heres going to do it  you noticed nothing unusual  doyou rememberwhat

forest  maybe we should run a lab test  we lost the original sample in the fire  l wantyou to understand what it is youre saying  you said ityourself  yeah butyou have to write it down  in your report  youre right  well take another sample from the forest  and run a comparison before we do anything  the detectives here  what doyou think  girlscreams  groans  you wouldnt listen to me  l told you to stay out ofthis  girlscreaming  hold it hold it right there  you got no business out here  there were screams  down on the ground  now  you know its billy  youve known it all along  l said down on the ground  how long areyou going to let it happen  hes going to kill her  billy  no  let her go  leave her alone  gunshot  mechanicalrattling  dad  billy  oh god  scully  scully  mulder what happened

all my friends  we were celebrating  what wereyou celebrating  graduation  and then the light came  lt took me away to the testing place  theywould tell me to gather the others  so that they could do tests  they put something in my head  here  billy l would wait for their orders  man billy who gave the orders  billy the light they said it would be okay  no one would know but the test didnt work  theywanted everything destroyed  they said theywere leaving  lm afraid  lm afraid theyre coming back  dont be afraid billy  indistinct whispers  what wevejust witnessed  what weve read in your field reports  the scientific basis and credibility  just seem wholly insupportable  youre aware ofthat  yes sir  my reports are personal and subjective  l havent gone so far as to draw any conclusion about what lve seen  or havent seen as seems to be the case  this uh time loss  you did or did not experience it  l cant substantiate it no  what exactly can you substantiate  l see no evidence  thatjustifies these investigations  there were ofcourse crimes committed  yes but how doyou prosecute a case like this  with testimony given under hypnosis  from a boywho claims he was given orders  from some alien force  through an implant  in his nose  you have no physical evidence  this is the object  described by billy miles  as a communication device  l removed it  from the exhumed body  l kept it in my pocket  lt was the only evidence not destroyed in the fire  l ran a lab test on it  the material could not be identified  agent mulder what are his thoughts  agent mulder believes we are not alone  thankyou agent scully  that will be all  phoneringing  hello  mulder scully its me l havent been able to sleep  l talked to the das office in raymond county oregon  theres no case file on
