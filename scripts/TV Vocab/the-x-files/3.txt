                 phoneringing   woman hi youve reached the usher residence  please leave a message at the tone   machinebeeps   hi honey lts about 830  lm going to be here a while  the presentation didnt go so well  call me  l loveyou bye  yelling    loudthud   guess who l ran into  from our class at quantico  marty neil  j edgarjr  just got bumped up  foreign counterintelligence  new york city bureau  supervisory special agent  supervisory  twoyears out ofthe academy  how did he land that  he lucked into the trade center bombing  well good for marty  come on dana  the guy is a loser  lookwhere he is now  lts where we should be  brad wilson told me  the psychological profile you wrote  on the washington crossing killer  led them to the suspect  youre on the violent crime sections fast track  how areyou doing  haveyou had any close encounters  ofthe third kind  ls that what everyone thinks l do  no ofcourse not  butyou do work with spooky mulder  mulders ideas may be a bit out there  but he is a great agent  well lve got this case thats out there  baltimore pd calls  theywant our help on a serial killer profile  three murders began six weeks ago  victims vary in age race gender  no connection to each other  but theres a pattern  point ofentry  the lack ofone  what doyou mean  college girl  killed in her cinder block dorm room  found with the windows locked  and the door chained from the inside  the last incident two days ago  highsecurity office building  nothing on the monitors  janitor spoke to the victim minutes before the murder  didnt hear or see a thing  suicides  each victim was found  with their liver ripped out  no cutting tool was used  bare hands  this looks like an x file  lets not get carried away  lm going to solve these murders but  l would likeyou to go over the case histories  maybe come down to the crime scene  doyou want me to ask mulder  okay ifhe wants to come and doyou a favor great  but make sure he knows this is my case  dana ifl can break a case like this one  lll be getting my bump up the ladder  and you  maybeyou wont have to be mrs spooky anymore  mulder why didnt theyaskme  scully theyre friends ofmine  theyjust felt more comfortable  talking to me  whywould l make them uncomfortable  lt probably has to do with your reputation  reputation l have a reputation  colton plays by the book and you dont  they feel your methods your theories are  spooky  doyou think lm spooky  man agent scullys in here sir  sorry lm late  wejust got here  uh fox mulder tom colton  what doyou think  does this look like the work oflittle green men  gray  excuse me  gray you said green men  a reticulan skin tone is gray  theyre notorious for their extraction  ofterrestrial human livers  due to iron depletion in the reticulum galaxy  you cant be serious  doyou have any idea what liver and onions go for there  excuse me  dana lve been thinking about this  and l have a theory  lt might explain a lot  tell me whatyou think  what ifthe guy enters  hold on a second  what in the hells he doing  uh that vent is six inches by about 1 8  even ifa reticulan could crawl through  its screwed in place  mulder this is the print from ushers office  these others are from an x file  ten murders baltimore area  undetermined points ofentry  each victim had their liver removed  these prints were discovered at five ofthe ten crime scenes  ten murders colton never mentioned  most likely hes unaware ofthem  these two prints were lifted fiveyears before he was born  at powhatan mill  these three were lifted  probably fiveyears before his motherwas even born  areyou saying  these prints are from the 1 960s and 1 930s  and fingerprinting wasjust coming into its own in 1 903  but there was a murder  involving an extracted liver  ofcourse  now thats five murders every 30 years  so two more to go this year  youre saying these are copycats  what did we learn  our first day at the academy  each fingerprint is unique  these are a perfect match  areyou suggesting  that l go before the violent crimes section  and present a profile declaring these murders  are done by aliens  l find no evidence ofalien involvement  well what then  this is the work ofa 1 00yearold killer  capable ofoverpowering a sixfoottwo businessman  and he should stick out in a crowd  with ten inch fingers  look bottom line  this is coltons case  ourx file dates back to 1 903  we had it first  mulder they dont wantyou involved  they dont want to hearyour theories  thats why blevins has you hidden away down here  youre down here too  look why dont we agree to this  theyll have their investigation  and well have ours and never  the twain shall meet  agreed  scully aftera carefulreview  ofthe violenceandpowerful nature ofthesemurders  ibelieve thekiller tobeamale   withaboveaverage intelligence  hismannerofentry hasso farbeen undetectable  thismaybe due tohissuperiorknowledge  oftheinnerstructure ofbuildingsandduct works  orthathe in fact hides inplainsight  posing as delivery ormaintenance workers  the extraction oftheliver  is themostsignificantdetail ofthese crimes  theliverpossesses regenerative qualities  itcleanses theblood  the taking ofthis trophy is the transferring act  for the killer to cleanse himself  ofhis own impurities  l think he is acting under the classic form  ofobsessivecompulsive behavior  now since the victims are unrelated  and we cannot predict who will be next  we must utilize the fact  that a killer will not always succeed  in finding a victim  when this occurs a serial killer  may return in frustration to the site ofa previous murder  hoping to recapture the emotional high  l think our best course ofaction  is to target these sites  goodjob agent scully  lfthere are no objections  ld like to begin our stakeouts ofthe murder sites tonight  were looking for a male  possiblywearing a uniform gas company ups whatever  l knowyoure assigned to another area scully  butyoure welcome to come aboard with us on this  that is ifyou dont mind working in an area  thats a bit more down to earth  man position ten station check  position ten l copy   metallicbanging    running footsteps   whoa  you wouldnt shoot an unarmed man  would you copper  what areyou doing here  hes not coming back  his thrill is derived from the challenge  ofa seemingly impossible entry  hes

getyour hands up  keep them up  youre under arrest  you have the right to remain silent  you were right  ls your full name eugene victortooms  yes  areyou a resident ofthe state of maryland  yes  areyou an employee  ofthe baltimore municipal animal control  yes  ls ityour intent to lie to me  about anything here today  no  wereyou ever enrolled in college  yes  wereyou ever enrolled in medical school  no  haveyou ever removed a liver  from a human being  no  haveyou ever killed a living creature  yes  haveyou ever killed a human being  no  wereyou ever in george ushers office  no  did you kill george usher  no  areyou over  that must be a control question  l had her ask it  no  haveyou ever been to powhatan mill  yes  ln 1 933  no  areyou afraid you might fail this test  well  yes  because l didnt do anything  he nailed it a  as far as lm concerned  the subject did not kill those two people  maintenance people at the office building  confirmed a call to animal control  regarding a bad smell  they found a dead cat in the ventilation ducts  on the second foor  that still doesnt explain  why he was there late  hes a civil servant with initiative  and we busted him for it  he was crawling up an air duct by himself  without alerting security  he passed the test  his story checks out  hes not the guy  lt doesnt mean your profiles incorrect  scullys right lts the guy  what doyou got mulder  he lied on questions 1 1 and 1 3  his electrodermal and cardiographic response  nearly go offthe chart  ls number 1 1 the hundredyearold question  let me tell you  i had a reaction to that stupid question  and what the hell is powhatan mill  two murders with matching mos  occurred in powhatan mill in 1 933  look at the chart  my interpretation  l dont need you or that machine  telling me iftooms was alive in 33  hes the guy   sighs   lm letting him go   tearingandcrumplingpaper   you coming  tom l want to thankyou  for letting me put in time with the vcs  but l am officially assigned to the x files  lll see what l can do  tom l can look out for myself  you said mulderwas out there  that guys insane   doorcloses   youknew they wouldntbelieveyou  why did you push it  maybe l thought you caught the right guy  and maybe l run into so many people who are hostile  just because they cant open their minds  to the possibilities  that sometimes the need to mess with their heads  outweighs the millstone ofhumiliation  lt seems likeyou were acting very territorial  l dont know forget it  ofcourse l was  ln our investigations  you may not always agree with me  but at least you respect thejourney  and ifyou want to continue working with them  l wont hold it againstyou  l wont hold it againstyou  l dont know  you must have something more  than your polygraph interpretation  to back up this bizarre theory  and l have to see what it is  mulder these are eugene toomss prints   computerkeys clicking   this is the fingerprint they took from ushers office  lt matches the old ones from the x files  obviously no match  what if  somehow   keys clicking   how could that be  the only thing l know for certain is  they let him go   dogbarking in distance   yelling    lets run a check on liver transplants  in the next 24 hours  maybe this thing is black market  come on lt was ripped out ofthere  look at this point  lm willing to give any theory a shot  any sane theory  lm sorry dana  but l onlywant qualified members  ofthe investigating team at the crime scene  whats the matter colton  you worried lll solveyour case  tom we have authorized access  to this crime scene  a report ofyou  obstructing another officers investigation might stick out  on your personnel file  look dana  whose side areyou on  the victims   the victim is a thomas werner  single white  thats tooms  he took something  baltimore pd checked out toomss apartment  lt was a cover  no one has ever lived there  and he hasnt shown up forwork  since he was arrested  l found him  how do we learn about the present  we look to the past  l think this is where it all began  in 1 903 on exeter street  look at the address  ofthat first murder in 1 903  apartment 203  he killed the guy above him  maybe his neighbor  played the victrola too loud  this must be toomss greatgrandfather  what about the prints  genetics might explain the patterns  and the sociopathic attitudes and behaviors  lt begins with one family member who raises an offspring  who raises the next child  so what is this the antiwaltons  well what doyou think  l thinkwe have to track eugene tooms  theres four down and one to go this year  lfwe dont get him now the next chance is   youll head the bureau by then  you go through the census  lll plough through this centurys  marriage birth death certificates  doyou have any dramamine  these things make me seasick  anything  nope  he disappeared offthe face ofthe earth  you  neverwas born never married  never died  at least in baltimore county  well l did find one thing though  um its the current address ofthe investigating officer  ofthe powhatan mill murders in 1 933  lve been waiting 25 years foryou  sir  l called it quits in 1 968  after 45 years as a cop  and those killings at powhatan mill  l was a sheriffthen  and ld seen my share ofmurders  bloody ones  but l could go home and  pitch a few baseballs to my kid  and never give it a second thought  you got to be able to do that  you youd go crazy right  but those murders in powhatan mill  when l walked into that room my heart went cold  my hands numbed  l could feel  it  feel what frank   sighs   when l first heard about the death camps in 1 945  l remembered powhatan mill  when l see the kurds and the bosnians  that room is there  l tell you  lts like all of the horrible acts  that humans are capable of  somehow gave birth to some kind ofhuman  monster   sighs   thats why l say  lve been waiting foryou  uh  theres a box in the trunk here  get it for me would you please  now this is all the evidence lve collected  officially and unofficially  unofficially  l knew that the murders in 63 were by the same person  as in 33  but by then they had me on a desk pushing papers  but by then they had me on a desk pushing papers  and theywouldnt let me anywhere near the case  a piece ofthe removed liver  but you know thats not the only trophy  he tookwith him  family members reported small personal effects  missing in each case  a hairbrush in the walters murder  a coffee mug in the taylor murder  haveyou ever heard the name eugene victortooms  when theywouldnt bring me aboard in 63  l did  some ofmy own work  l took these surveillance pictures  now this  is tooms  ofcourse that was him  and this  is the apartment where he lived  it was located at  66 exeter street  right  thats it  right there   birds cooing   heres 1 03  the old man was right  you can feel it   sighs   theres nothing here  check this out  whats down here  l dont know  lets find out  just an old coal cellar  mulder somebody having a garage sale  this is the shape on werners mantle  frank said he collected trophies  mulder does he live in here  scully lt looks like  the walls deteriorating  no somebody made it  this is a nest  look  lts made out of rags and newspapers  this looks like the opening  think theres anything inside  oh my god mulder  it smells like  l think its bile  ls there anyway l can get it offmy fingers quickly  without betraying my cool exterior  no one could live in this  l dont think its where he lives  l think its where he hibernates  hibernates  just listen  what ifsome genetic mutation could allow a man  to awaken every 30 years  mulder  and what ifthe five livers could provide him sustenance  for that period  what iftooms is some kind of20thcentury  genetic mutant  ln any case hes not here now  and hes got to come back  well need a surveillance team  yeah lt will take some finagling  go downtown and see whatyou can finagle  and lll keep watch   gasps   oh wait  lm snagged on something  lts okay l got it  lts about time  so who we looking for again  eugene tooms  hes unarmed but consider him dangerous  scully and l will relieveyou in eight hours  ifhe doesnt

 lt isnt interfering with your investigation  when we first had lunch  l looked forward to working with you  but now l couldnt haveyou  far enough away  dont go down there  l had the stakeout  called

interested to know  that lve ordered some genetic tests  the preliminary medical exam revealed  quite abnormal development  in the muscular and skeletal systems  as well as a continually declining metabolic rate  lt dips way below the levels registered  in deep sleep  did you hear  what l said mulder  all these people putting bars on theirwindows  spending good money on hightech security systems  trying to feel safe  l look at this guy and l think  lt aint enough
