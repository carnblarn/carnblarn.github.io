                here let me do it  putyour number in then your card  whats your number roland  three fifteen  see how easy it is  engine efficiency   ninetyfour percent  we need more  hows the back pressure holding  what doyou think its climbing  increase the blade inclination i said  the inclination ofthe blade is pi over nine  weve reached maximum velocity  no  let it go it will work  it will destroy itself im not going to do that  its not going to destroy itself  come on were almost there  our equations are wrong   what happened  nothing he pulled the plug  im just protecting the baby and fouryears ofwork  fouryears that add up to zilch  unless we show some progress  theyre going to pull the plug on us ron  you should have continued with the test  somebodys going to crack mach 1 5  and i want it to be us  i wontjeopardize everything becauseyou two  cant wait to see your name in print  its print that gets the money ron  go down in fames together fine go ahead  im going to do the math  good night dr keats  what the hell  roland  open the door  open the door  roland i wantyou to listen to me very carefully  we have to open this door roland  stop typing roland  roland open the door  what areyou doing  open the door  roland hit escape areyou listening  screaming  splat  how was the wedding  the part where the groom passed out  or the dog bit the drummer  did you catch the bouquet  maybe  is that whatyou couldnt talk about over the phone  the project everyone says doesnt exist does exist  the lcarus project  the next generation injet engine design  capable ofdoubling current supersonic speeds  using halfthe fuel at least in theory  and ronald surnow was an aeronautical scientist  who worked on it here at the university   yes  how close are they  im not sure but surnows the second team scientist  to die in six months  but how is this an x file  mulder you dont think  this has anything to do with ufo technology  theres something unexplainable scully  but its not unidentifiable   keats  there  dr keats  were with the fbi  im agent mulder this is agent scully  we understand you discovered dr surnow this morning  what was left ofhim  how doyou suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel  someone must have shut him in  by computer  weve already been through this with the police  another member ofyour team died recently  isnt that correct  yes  arthur grable  he was killed in an automobile accident in november  im frank nollette im also on the project  areyou certain it was an accident  what areyou driving at  yourwork seems to be  a perfect target for industrial espionage  who wrote this  ron was working on it when i left  the handwriting here  doesnt match other handwriting on the board  it isnt mine  what about roland fuller  uh rolands the uhjanitor  according to the police  he was the only other person here  roland didnt do that  how doyou know  letsjust say roland isnt exactly a rocket scientist  here  tracy   giggles  with stars  woman roland  there are some people here to talkwith you  uhoh  i went offthe paper  sorry  thats all right roland  tracy  would you help me in the tv room  okay  hi roland mind ifwe sit down  thanks  mind ifwe askyou a couple questions  doyou rememberworking last night  uhhuh  doyou remember seeing anything unusual  seeing any strangers  did dr surnow or dr keats or dr nollette  do anything unusual  nope  you must like stars  one hundred and fortyseven  sorry  stars  you like numbers too huh  roland let me helpyou  one two three  four five  six seven eight  roland ls everything okay  roland areyou all right  eleven  twelve thirteen  what happened  what did you say to upset him so  sixteen seventeen  its definitely the work ofa fourth individual  surnows keats and nollettes cursive standards  dont match whatyou found on the white board  will you do me a favor and try this  what is it  something roland doodled at the home  you dont really think roland  he was the only other person in the lab  yes but were talking  about a sophisticated fuid dynamics equation  roland barely has an lq of70  you saw his facility with mathematics  some autistic individuals display unusual abilities  yes but even savants  behave only as human calculators  they can perform certain functions  but they cant tell the value ofanything  or the meaning ofa number  i hate to take sides but the bottom line is no  the terminal stroke on the six the roofon the five  im sorry he didnt write it  gasping  grunting  loud music from earphones  beeping  door clicks  screaming  shattering  crunching  typing  scully an organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen  will become frozen  exhibiting great tensile strength  but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact  now ive seen this demonstrated on a fish before  i dont think theyll be performing  this experiment on beakmans world  has this been dusted  treatyourself  thanks  hey scully look at these files   kman must be keats  his file was turned off at 1 231 last night  scully but look someone else entered a file  under the name arthur after 1 231   and worked on it for nearly five hours  well it couldnt have been keats  judging from the rigor ofthe body  he was dead around 1 230  youre saying someone came in here killed keats  and worked on an old grable file  i cant access the arthur file  were going to need the password  try 1 5626  how did you know that that was  this is arthur grables work  on the same fuid dynamics equations  the others were working on  look at all those entries  someone has been continuing his work since he died  how did you know what the password was  woman wave goodbye wave goodbye  child crying  say goodbye byebye  wave goodbye  door opening  roland  why did you sleep in your clothes  well lets getyou dressed  you have visitors  im not supposed to talk to them  who told you that  remember that talkwe had about being shy  these are nice people roland  hey roland you have more shirts than i do  i think this one would look stylin today  what doyou think   the green one  green one  please  mrs stodie  can i talk toyou a second  seeyou later roland  this one  hereyou go  soyou likeyourjob at the college roland  yes  i hearyoure very good at it  doyou remember howyou gotyourjob  a man talked to mrs stodie  what man  dr grable  was dr grable nice toyou  yes  when was the last time you spoke to him  last week day before  dr grable died  im sorry  yes  people die  they go away  and theyre not supposed to come back  has roland ever mentioned the name arthur  that was dr grables first name  but we only called him dr grable  i doubt roland even knew his first name was arthur  scully mrs stodie can i get a copy  of rolands file and past history  our histories are confidential  i understand  but i have grounds to obtain them  the less time we spend in court  the more time we have to help roland  roland fullerwas hired byarthur grable  he went to the halfway house  specifically to find a mentally challenged person  areyou suggesting  arthur grable hired roland to use him  areyou suggesting arthur grable is not dead  ifhe had intentions ofkilling nollette keats and surnow  why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect  yeah but by the look ofthis hes hamburger  maybe he staged it  that would explain why his work is continuing on  six months after his death  this obituary says arthur grable was born in seattle  his fatherwas a big banker  his motherwas active in a number ofcharities  only child  summa cum laude in physics  doctoral and postdoctoral  in aeronautical engineering at harvey mudd  brilliant future tragically cut short  rolands also from seattle  he spent most ofhis life at the heritage halfway house  the identity ofhis parents has been sealed  theres no information on roland before age three  when he was put in the program  does it saywhen he was born  july 1 5 1 952  thats also arthurs birth date  dontyou wish you could fy  i can  when i dream  people can do anything in a dream you know  once one time i had a dream we were married  and lived in a house  doyou have dreams roland  you can tell me  roland  whos arthur  im sorry roland  im sorry  roland  roland  go away  roland whats the matter  go away  i dont want to hurtyou  go away  go away  mulder ls thatyou  nollette yes  whats the story here  sighs  um a quantum physics professor ofmine  at harvey mudd funked me  he challenged the tenets ofone ofmy theories  a theory i later published in nature  anyway to get back at him  one afternoon we decided to take his car apart  and put it back together again in his office  and left it running  an egghead classic  it was grables idea  scully ls that grable on the chair  yeah  was he a practical joker  atop ofall his brilliance  he had a genius for executing elaborate schemes  could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 lq  is gaining access to and operating  his old computer files  arthurwould still have to be alive  could he have faked his own death  no  the police report on the auto accident  that killed grable is woefully incomplete  a dry road surface no mechanical problems found  the bodywas never admitted to a county morgue  and there was no funeral  ifyou are trying to suggest  that arthur grable killed surnow and keats  and is after me next youre way off  art could not have done the murders  how can you be so certain  man this is arthur grable  because ofthe massive internal damage to his body  caused by the car accident we could only preserve the head  wouldntyour client find it inconvenient  to be thawed out only to discover  he had no functional mobility  we believe that by the time science figures a way  to revive our clients  youll also know how to clone new bodies  exactly  this technology is progressing faster  than anyone thought possible  ask anyone here at the university  so while for us the passing ofeach second  brings our bodies closer to death  for our clients it brings them closer to life  these fuctuations in temperature  do they happen often  no weve had some problems with this capsule  our technicians have checked it  but theyve found nothing  could the brain cause the fuctuations  no but we are looking for the explanation  the patients in no danger  he remains perfectly preserved  as long as theres liquid nitrogen in the capsule  maywe take a look at arthur grables records  thankyou  dr barrington  in the future what requirements will exist  to be an organ or tissue donor  same requirements as there are today  compatible genetic makeup  its best ifthe donors related  mulder  arthur grable put down only one donor  mulder roland fuller and arthur grable had the same birthday  i think theyre twins  older oryounger  same age  just less hairy and with better eyesight  and the moustache  scully no lose the whole beard  next  closecropped hair  with a slightly receding widows peak  lose the glasses  thats roland  give or take a few pounds  tell me aboutyour dreams roland  its all right i wont tell anybody  you know i had a dream last night  i dreamt i was swimming in this pool  and i could see my father underwater  but when i dove down the water stung my eyes  then there was another man at the pool watching me  he upset me  he was asking me questions i didnt want to answer  and i had to leave  i couldnt find my father  i cant tell you my dreams  why not  bad  your dreams are bad roland  notyou  youre a good person  i hit tracy  your dreams makeyou hit tracy  you know how to work this toy roland  here  you see the wayyou work that toy  is like whats happening toyou  youre the spaceship roland  and your dreams are the controls  who  who runs the controls  haveyou seen this man recently  woman we have to say byebye to roland  screaming  roland  roland  roland stop  roland  roland  roland  we need to keep roland under observation  roland  glass breaking  hes trying to get away  roland  roland  nollettes gone  we should arrange a security guard to find him  no ones going to provideyou with anything  onceyou explain your theory  on how roland fuller is capable ofthese murders  youve got a brother dontyou scully  yeah two  haveyou ever thought about calling one ofthem  and then all ofa sudden the phone rings  and its one ofthem calling you  does this pitch end  with a way for me to lower my long distance charges  evidence suggests psychic connections  are stronger between family members  particularly between twins that shared the same womb  okay but in this case  one sibling has closer ties to a frozen fudgsicle  than to his own brother  arthur grable is not dead  hes in a state ofconsciousness  that no human has ever returned from  what ifthat state allows one to develop psychic ability  beyond the potential ofthe conscious mind  he could use that ability to control his brother  to kill those scientists  but whywould he kill his colleagues  thats a question only dr nollette can answer  okay lets go  i have to call my brother  mulder wevegot to fiindnollette  scully lets talk to campussecurity  wego this way  no wegoleft  well whereveryou are arthur  im sureyoull appreciate this  arthur and roland grable  born at puget presbyterian to mr and mrs lewis grable  onjuly 1 5 1 952  arthurwas four minutes older than roland  identical twins  which means theyre the result ofa single egg  fertilized by a single sperm  ive read studies  which suggest that in some cases  the identical twin arises very early in the embryonic stage  when a mutation in one cell is rejected by the other cells  as foreign  so rolands condition is the result of  a damaged chromosome rejected by one ofarthurs cells  in a way that would explain arthurs genius  and rolands strange mathematical gift  in a way  phone rings  agent scully  this is larry barrington at the avalon foundation  weve got a situation here  uhhuh  last night we had a breakin at the facility  thats right  its arthur grables storage unit  his internalthermostats been compromised  well is there any tissue damage  were trying to assess that now  the temperatures still rising  somethings blocking our access to the cooling program  someone tampered with arthur grables capsule  theyre attempting to stabilize it now  nollette  what  what is it  alarm ringing  ifl have seen further than other men  its because i have stood on the shoulders ofgiants  no  this isntyours  its amazing  theres this body sitting there  in front ofme talking  butyoure controlling it arthur  you took mywork  snickers  what good was yourwork going to doyou  you died before you could finish it  beforeyou could publish it  it was mine  and a brilliant piece ofwork too  when i saw the writing on the white board  i knew someone had found the key  mach 1 5 was within our reach  our futures were guaranteed  ironic isnt it  you did all the work  and i get all the glory  no  yes  yes arthur  i was here working on the intake problem  moments away from a solution when you attacked me  fortunately i was carrying a gun  after the murder ofmy colleagues who could blame me  no  oh thats interesting  laughs ive got it  thats it  ive got it  groans  arthur  arthur open the door  arthur  arthur how doyou stop this  tell me how arthur  wait roland we need you to help us  please we need you to help us  to stop the machine  child crying  try to remember how  roland youve got to help him or hell die  wave goodbye arthur  screaming  mulder come on roland  roland i cant remember  yells  scully hell be held in  psychiatric custody for evaluation  is he being charged with a crime  the da hasnt made that determination yet  but weve recommended that he be remanded toyour custody  as soon as the court deems it appropriate  how could this happen  roland never exhibited anyviolent tendencies  its my beliefthat he wasnt acting under his own volition  what doyou mean  this is the work ofarthur grable rolands brother  its a new theory ofjet propulsion  unfinished at the time ofhis death  in the last two weeks roland has  completed the calculations  how  were not sure mrs stodie  all we know is that roland  was somehow able to finish his brothers research  roland  where areyou going  roland dont go  i have to  okay bye  tracy  wait  keep my stars  i loveyou  me too
