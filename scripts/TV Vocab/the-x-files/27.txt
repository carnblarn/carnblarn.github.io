thank you excuse me its ok  hey ralph how you doin all right thanks for coming at short notice i realise the fbis behavioral science unitmainly profiles murder suspects still at large it must be odd being asked to profileour suspects all of whom are dead i am relieved the bureauanswered our request and sent you in all honesty agent mulder whateversgoing on here is way over our heads the suspects body is out on the sidewalk were holding the security guardwho shot him the witnesses in the elevator are down at thehospital talk to them whenever youre ready ive asked all the businessesin the building to close for the day weve done our best to preserve the areafor you weve photographed the scene the areas been sketchedbut we havent dusted for prints yet we wanted to wait for youbefore collecting further evidence was this damaged during the incident  ill find out may i see the suspect things like this arentsupposed to happen here a 42yearold realestate agent murders fourstrangers that shouldnt happen anywhere since colonial times theres onlybeen three murders in this area in the last six monthsseven people have killed 22 per capita thats higher than the combinedhomicide rate of detroit dc and los angeles this town is not any of those places infranklin you never have to pull off the road to make way for a celebritydriving with a gun to his head in each incident the suspect was killed suicide by cop each incident occurred in a public place the suspect went crazy and refused to desist officers used deadly force to save lives were autopsies conductedfor substance abuse this town is mainly made up of apple andcherry growers folks here dont drink much they certainly dont do drugsthe coroners tests were negative this is dispatch can you provideadditional backup for unit 42 played softballwith this guy over labor day he was one of those nice guys couldnt playand didnt bitch about being in right field whats wrong with right field always the first to shake hands at the endof the game whether hed won or lost you gotta have an arm to play right field bought a round of beers afterwardseven though he didnt drink i played right field lets have this analysed by the bureaus lab what the hell could bring anyone to do this  i wanna go home dont be in such a hurry youll just have to waitfor the man to finish ok  mommy baby youre bleeding come on tilt your head back i told you to leave it alone ok now dont touch it or itll bleed again tilt your head back there you go lucky we had a kleenex eh good girl hey hey what the hells wrong with you mass murderers are divided into twoclassifications the spree killer and the serial the violent outburst in a public locale and the suspects disregardfor anonymity or survival define the franklin incidentsas spree killings the confounding element of these profilesis that given their backgrounds the perpetrators would be statistically more likely the victims of violent crimesrather than the originators the killers were all middleincomeresponsible people none with a history of violence relatives reported only minordisplays of dysfunctional behaviour sleep disorders headacheseating difficulties but witnesses did report the last suspectdisplayed a claustrophobic reaction im convincedan outside factor is responsible but i must concede frustrationas to a determination of the cause a residue on the fingers ofthe most recent perpetrator was analysed and reported to be an undefined butnontoxic organic chemical found on plants perhaps remaining from gardening there have been reported abducteeparanoia in ufo massabduction cases i was wondering when youd get to that i find no evidence of this to be the case the single connecting trace evidence is the destruction ofan electronic device at the crime scene a pager a fax machine a cellular phone a gas pump digital display in all honesty scully ive never hada more difficult time developing a profile there is no way to know who will be a killer or who will be killed hello hello  youre late im sorry i called earliera deadline came up at work if its ready ill justpay you and be out of here how did you manage to break that

murderis more of the same they dont seem to be connected well should i be relieved or more scared i mean is this the start of copycat killers larry its not a copyof the other homicides this wasnt a public areathe suspect fled covering his tracks the killer appearsnot to have had a premeditated weapon they are connected  mrs mcroberts yes this is sheriff spencer im agentfox mulder with the fbi

i did it  i broke it why mrs mcroberts did you see something in the readout mrs mcroberts i can help mrs mcroberts  stop no anomalies were foundduring postmortem analysis that were undetected in previous autopsies levels of adrenaline are highin cases of violent death twice as much as in victims of natural death this subjects levels were 200 times normal the adrenal gland displayed extensiveadrenal haemorrhage yet not from disease but rather from wear other physiological evidence presentindicated episodes of intense phobia analysis of the vitreous humourextracted from the eyeball indicated the presence of high concentrationof an undetermined chemical compound this compound at its base is similar to the substance analysedearlier on a perpetrators finger although further qualitativeanalysis must be performed it is my opinion that this chemicalwhen reacting with adrenaline and other compoundssecreted during phobic episodes creates a substance similarto lysergic acid diethylamide lsd pardon me id like to apply for a job sorry theyre not acceptingapplications at this time sir may we ask youto sign up for the blood drive are you all right sir hmm in our april edition of the lone gunman weran an article on the cias new ccdth2138 fibreopticlens microvideo camera small enough to beplaced on the back of a fly imagine being a flyon the wall of the oval office been there done that that is a eurasian cluster fly they infest vegetation like apples or cherriesand can inflict a lot of damage to crops its been irradiated to control propagation or agents of competingagricultural corporations posing as franklin city employees arereleasing fertile flies to destroy the crop no this bugs been nuked it was a fine effort though have you ever come acrossthis chemical compound lsdm obviously you havent readour august edition of tlg oh im sorry boys it arrived the same dayas my subscription to celebrity skin come over here  so mulder wheres your little partner she wouldnt come  shes afraid of her love for you shes tasty frohike its men like youthat give perversion a bad name here toxic pesticides the chemical in that reportis called lysergic dimethrin an unreleased experimentalsynthetic botanical insecticide  it acts as a natural pheromone lsdm is sprayed on the plant which invokes a fear response in the pestget out of here theres danger  the insect leaves the plant why wont they release it is it possible it affectshumans in the same way possible let me show you something this is actual newsreelfootage taken in the 50s theyre spraying ddt a chemical thegovernment did release and determine safe they convinced local officialsit was safe to spray on children it took a decade of bureaucratic andindustry heeldragging before it was banned  different chemicals same stunts they just learned how not to be so obvious hey frohike can i borrow those if i can have scullys phone number stealth helicopters experimental pesticidesresponsible for violent behaviour i saw the chopper from twodifferent locations look at my skin feel my hair the insecticide is still on me ive checked up on you you have a penchant for spooky evidence  dont start that crap dont divert blame hang on a second if youre the one whos responsible the sooner you take responsibilitythe sooner people will stop dying the killers all residednear heavily sprayed areas you dont live here mulderi live here i have my heart in this town i have three childrenim not gonna dump poison on them yeah well if its so safewhy was it done in secret  what kind of a crusade are you on answer the question are we spraying this county lives on moneygenerated from its crops irradiated flies were not effective the delays to get approval wouldhave caused millions in crop damage look at the hell they raised over malathion meanwhile peoples lives werebeing ruined by a damn bug ruined 23 people are dead theres no proof the spray causedviolent behaviour it was proven safe by who who proved it to you im sorry mulder hes right id love to say i flew 300 milesin the middle of the night to prove youre about to becomethe next charles manson but i find little physiological evidence that states that lsdm has toxicallyaffected you even after massive ingestion your own autopsy saysthe killer had chemical anomalies yes but you are proof thatit wasnt from exposure to lsdm may i see that chart agent scully sure look here these are normal  perhaps subjectedto repeated lsdm spraying scully are you familiarwith subliminal messages you mean like sex andice cubes in liquor ads  thats paranoia no its a fact stores use subliminal messages intheir ambient music to deter shoplifting the russians use electroencephalographictechniques to control behaviour  how is this connected with the spraying electronic devices were always destroyed  im still waiting the insecticide lsdm is known to cause fear in cluster flies what if it causes the same reactionin humans all the perpetrators were phobic taber was claustrophobic mcrobertsshusband said she had a fear of rape the insecticide heightenedtheir phobia to an unbearable level the electronic devices relayed messages thattold them what to do in order to alleviate it  the messages were relayed purposely by who hes probably one of those peoplethat thinks elvis is dead mulder i was wrong exposure tothe insecticide does induce paranoia i think this area is being subjectedto a controlled experiment controlled by who by the government by a corporation by reticulans theyve done it before ddt in the 50s agentorange germ warfare on unsuspecting areas yes but why mulder why intentionallycreate a populace that destroys itself fear its the oldest tool of power if youredistracted by fear of those around you it keeps you from seeingthe actions of those above i just had a talk with mr winter ive persuaded him to a compromise hes agreed to stop the spraying and to blood testing extensivelyof people exposed to the spray area but but the official explanation for the testingcannot be linked to the side effects of lsdm franklin and venango
