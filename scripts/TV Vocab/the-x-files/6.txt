who they are  but what they have  lm sure they have no idea because they called us in  l have xfiles  each case has an element ofwhat we saw tonight  residual electrostatic charge internal mutilation  none has the elements combined in one case  how can an esophagus be crushed without the neck being touched  psychokinetic manipulation  psychokinesis  you mean how carrie got even at the prom  the russians were doing studies on it  the chinese still are  their findings are kept secret  okay lm intrigued but how can we investigate  we have nothing to go on  just getting in lauren  oh  mr graves

hi  the paramedics checkyou out  yeah lm fine although l do have  a standinginline atthedmvsized headache  mines more lrssized  did they check out the car  lts brandnew only 1 00 miles  then someone tampered with it  while we were in her house  the mechanic says everythings in proper order  nothing cut nothing greased  check out the lights  theyre on  no the filaments are heated  due to massive levels ofelectrostatic charge  just like the bodies in the morgue  and isnt it interesting that lauren kyte  was present at both incidents  she was in our presence the entire time  what ifits possible  to raise the bodys electrostatic charge  to the levels weve been seeing  and use that energy to affect objects  lfa person generated that much energy  their body would break down  theyd glow like those lights  theres evidence ofthis in the xfiles  furniture moving untouched  objects levitating  unexplained electrical discharges  frequently people who have psychokinetic power  are unaware oftheir own capability  areyou saying lauren kyte crashed our car  either that  or a poltergeist  theyre here  they may be  mulder look at  the tangible evidence  two mideast extremists were killed  trying to assault a woman  working for a manufacturer ofparts  for the defense department  when we questioned her our carwas sabotaged  ln both cases someone else may have committed those acts  maybe the same someone from the atm photos  the mystery isnt psychokinetic energy  lts her accomplice  excuse me  shes clean no arrest not even a traffic ticket  the only thing is  shes in deep with her credit card company 1 5000  what doyou think youre doing  man lm going to put that on here  no no lll take care ofthis all right  here lll talk to somebody  mulder a little upset over losing a parking

seems to be some blood work missing here  we only do that ifwe suspect homicide  l dont supposeyou ran any dental confirmations  what for lt was him  how did you know  lt said so on the toe tag  who made positive ld on the body  um  lauren kyte  mulder but he was cremated  theres no way to run a dental check  or get a dna sample  yes there is  his bodys tissues and organs were donated  man howard graves is in five different people  they harvested the organs immediately after death  his kidneys were sent to boston  his liver to dallas  and his corneas to portland oregon  theyve all been transplanted  because ofhis age  we could only cryopreserve the dura matter  in the membrane ofthe spinal column  we have mr graves hospital records  well extract a sample run a test  and in a couple ofhours confirm the identity ofthe donor  l uh made them rush soyou could haveyour check  beforeyou leave  oh lm going to miss you  oh  oh what  here  goodbye    you were going to leave  without saying goodbye  well uh l came to say goodbye  and to wish you luck  and to leaveyou with this little thought  l know howard told you  and ifit ever gets out  l wont waste my time trying to pin the source  lll go straight toyou  and youll do to me whatyou did  to howard  l knowyou had him killed  whywould you say that  he told me    mulder  how soon can you  be at my house  why  please hurry  the tests are conclusive  the dura matter does belong to howard graves  he is indeed very dead    just a second    go run the bath  get out ofhere  no  no    no no    no   nono      you know youre not under arrest  yourejust here for questioning  the sooner you talk to us  the sooner you get to go home  what happened  to those people tonight  doyou have any idea who they might be  why did they attackyou  doyou know who this is  scully mulder  hell keep an eye on her  come on now  youve seriously compromised our investigation  we were following leads pertaining to an xfile  l want to know every detail ofyour activities  concerning this case  youre the ones who have been  withholding information  why dontyou tell us whatyouve got  then we have nothing more to talk about  wait we believe htg  lndustrial technologies sold restricted parts  to the lsfahan  serial numbers were recovered in the wreckage  ofthe bombing ofa navy transport van  how is lauren kyte involved  your actions impeded our investigation  we dont have enough evidence to hold her  lfshe doesnt talk she goes free  and we lose our chance to break this company  l could make her talk  my advice toyou dont get rough with her  that was a waste oftime  your turn  lauren  l wont talk toyou either  okay then youre free to go  l cant go back to that house  why  because of howard graves  hes dead  l know  hes watching overyou isnt he  lauren l dont know ifyouve ever been a secretary before  sometimes your boss can talk  as ifyou werent even in the room  which can hurt you know  sometimes youre all he has to talk to  which is how it always was with me and howard  one night late l went into his office  he was crying more scared than sad  the pentagon contracts were being canceled  the companywas going under  he felt personally responsible for each ofhis employees  seeing and feeling their fear every day  reallywore him down  then this one time dorlund came with that group  that mideast group lsfahan  theyd buy parts at an outrageous price  notjust once  for as long as they could get awaywith it  that night howard was crying he hadjust found out  that lsfahan had claimed responsibility  for killing a couple sailors in florida  he was never the same  and l thought thats why he killed himself  but he didnt  l saw  howard showed me how dorlund had him killed  made it look like a suicide cause he could see  howard was going to put an end to the deal  so now howard is protecting you  lt sounds so ridiculous  butyou believe it  he was closer to me than my father  l told him that  l still feel his presence  sometimes l even smell his aftershave  lfyoujust could have seen the things lve seen  l just want all that to go away  thats why lm leaving  maybe he can move on  thats not enough  you have been given the chance to tell him again  take it  tell him you love him by showing him  by by helping us finish his unfinished business  lauren how will you ever  be able to rest ifhe never can  okay  lm a mess  lm going to uh wash up  what areyou doing scully  you dont believe  mulder theres no such things as ghosts or psychokinesis  lm sure theres an explanation but l believe that she believes  and my priority is to get her to help us stop dorlund  well we may havejust sacrificed our best opportunity  to observe spectral phenomena  no lm giving us the chance to solve a case thats tangible  instead ofchasing after shadows    areyou ready  all right everyone  we have a warrant to search the premises  for evidence pertaining to the sale  ofrestricted manufactured parts  the evidence may be in the form  offalsified export licenses parts manifests communiques  lt could be on computer disk or hard copy  once there ifin doubt ask  we need this to be clean  this is the culmination ofa yearlong investigation  lfwe dont come out ofthere todaywith something  proving a connection to the lsfahan  this guy could walk  okay lets go  you okay  lt will most likely be in dorlunds office  well execute the search but well need you to guide us  soyou have to be strong okay  scully everybody stay calm  federal bureau oflnvestigation  maam could you back away from those files please  this is all we could find  we dont have him  hes not even breaking a sweat  webster our case is blown  weve wasted a year  this guys going to walk  lets get out ofhere  mulder lauren its
