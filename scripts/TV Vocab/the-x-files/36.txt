                blood everywherewhoever killed her is a psycho  murder weapon seven stores in town carry strop razors  have somebody check em out what about the press just the basicsno mention of this sister thing ok rubin i need your final reportcall me as soon as you hear  thats all i can tell you can you give us a name yeah ill talk to you were doing the best we canwell inform you brian i need a minute im working on a homicide investigation come on you didnt show last night this what you wanna talk about i made dinner what sorry coroners on one yeah what have you got rubin uhhuh uh hang on a second will you rubin  this address ten oclock tonight wheres this  a motel its a place we can talk any cavities i brush after every meal would you say they match well theres a filling on the occlusal surfaceof the upper left bicuspid here and here and hes congenitally missinga lower left bicuspid here and here yeah id say theyre definitely a match  who do they belong to special agent sam chaney  that name sounds familiar chaneys a legend chaney and his partnertim ledbetter investigated what were then called stranger killingsnow called serial murders they disappeared while investigatingmurders in aubrey missouri in 1942 chaneys body was only found two days agoby a local detective bj morrow a woman why the interest in this case at the time chaneys and ledbetters ideaswerent very well received by their peers using psychology to solve a crimewas something like um  believing in the paranormal exactly but theres another mystery which is why would this policewoman suddenly driveher car into a field the size of rhode island and for no reason dig up the bonesof a man whos been missing for 50 years  unless a neon sign said dig here i guess thats why were going to aubrey yes and also ive alwaysbeen intrigued by women named bj detective morrowexactly how did you discover the remains i saw a dog digging in the ground i proceeded to investigateand found the grave site the initial police report states thatyou couldnt explain your actions at the time it was latei was a bit shocked by my discovery im afraid i didnt clearly articulatewhat happened for my initial report why were you in the woods at that hour my vehicle was experiencing engine failure you left your car over there sir would you say thats uh 400 or 500 yards yes sir so from that distance you could seea dog digging in this field at night she took a short cut through the woods toreach a phone the path led her to the field the report says she phoned from the motelblack up the road thats not a very short cut you seem more interestedin how the missing agent was found than in how he got here in the first place  you dont uh suspect her do you no no not at all  id just like to ask you a few more questions all right have you ever um have you ever hadany clairvoyant experiences premonitions visionsprecognitive dreams things like that what the hell kind of question is that  dreams yeah agent mulder i dont mean to be rudebut we have a lot to do if you have any more questions specificto your investigation of this crime please feel free to call come on bj what do you think these bones are in good condition the field may have been tilledsoon after chaney was buried there are small cuts on the top three ribsi dont think they were made by an animal listen to this one must wonder how thesemonsters are created chaney wrote this did their home life mould theminto creatures that must maim and kill or are they demons from birth thats poetic but it doesnt help us much what did he say about the 1942 homicides the press called the murdererthe slash killer his three victimswere all young women aged 25 to 30 he disabled them with a blow to the head hed carve the word sister on their chestsand paint it on the wall with their blood the victims bled to death and the murderer was never found mulder these cuts on the ribscouldve been made by a razor  can you make out a word no but we might be able to if we can findsomebody in aubrey with a digital scanner ive scanned the crime photo and ribcageimages and modemed them to quantico itll be a few seconds before hookup i checked with the mechanicbjs car was just tuned she lied about experiencing engine failure i dont think bj was in the woodsbecause of engine failure what are you talking about the motel black is a perfect meeting place  away from town away from his wife what do you mean its obvious bj and tillmanare having an affair how do you know  a woman senses these things oh the image on the right is chaneys ribcage the left one was extrapolated from the crimephoto of the slash killers last victim now i need to enlarge the victims ribcagein order to allow for gender difference and now we can compare them could he have carved out another wordon his ribcage im searching forany matching pattern of cuts agent mulder have you made any progressin the investigation uh we may have agent chaney might have beena victim of the killer he was trying to catch were trying to determine if the cutson his ribcage spell out a word are you all right im sorry something im not feel excuse me feeling better im fine now things must be difficult for you now ive had feelings for people ive worked withinteroffice relationships can be complicated especially when hes married youre pregnant arent you does it show no not yet now i know why my motheronly had one child she told me about the nauseabut not about the nightmares nightmares its always the same im in a house it feels familiar theres a womanthats been hurt theres a mirror i see a mans reflection i recognise his face but i dont know him what i remember most is the bloodtheres a lot of blood have you talked to anyone about this im sure its something about the pregnancyif anyone else knew i was pregnant brian would kill me if i told anyone what are you going to do i dont know well bjs pregnant and tillmans the father um ive approximated the pattern of the cutsto match up with the letters theres a 93 chance that this is the letter r and if you lower the probability to 79 you get the letters i e and r it could be a wordor it could just be random slashes if we exhumed a victimof the slash killer we could do a ct scan to determine if the cutswere made by the same instrument that means getting a court orderthat could take two days  maybe we could find a relative who could brother excuse me i know what it says on the ribcage it spells brother youre right bj brian whats goin on here bj  nothing really then whered you get these these are crimescene photosthey were sealed no one had access to em youre wrong those were shot in 1942 these are from a homicidethat occurred three days ago no theyre from a case that ledbetterand chaney investigated in 1942 before they disappeared three days agoa young woman was murdered the word sister was carvedinto her chest and painted on the wall only myself the coronerand one of my men knew about this excuse me sir we just got a calltheres been another one watch your step sir the victims name is verna johnson oh my god  bj its her its the woman in my dream ow oh youll be all right honey youre fine the mothering instinct ive been feeling it a lot lately i used to hate itwhen my mother hovered over me i swore id never be like her i think we all feel that wayat one time or another my father was a cop a good cop thats all i ever wanted to be hed say what were doing here is nonsensethat you cant solve a crime from a dream ive often felt that dreams are answers toquestions we havent figured out how to ask you said you were in a familiar house theres a woman thats been hurt i look in a mirror and i see a mans reflection what does he look like hes got a rash on his face and his eyes are intense do you remember anything else theres this strange pictureon the wall behind him its a building like thewashington monument but different and theres a a big circular thing beside it  do you think you could draw it sure it looked something like this what do you think it is could be the trylon and the perisphereever been to new york city no never you can get pictures of theseon postcards all over times square these were symbols of the 1939 worlds fair do you know whythey might have been in your dream no idea at all good night youre here kind of late  what are you looking for i just wanted to check on somethin i dont get it that books from the 1940s can we talk you know im willing to go with you for the appointment im not so sure its what i wanna do i thought we agreedthat it was the best thing for both of us  i changed my mind what do you mean you changed you cant just change your mindthis isnt your decision its our decision bj its him brian i have to go this is the manbj claims to have seen in her dream harry cokelyhe lives in gainesville nebraska since his release from mccallisterpenitentiary on december 5 1993 he was convicted in 1945for rape and attempted murder cokely carved sister on the chestof his victim linda thibedeaux before she could escape and get help and the police never connected itto the 1942 homicides no i dont wanna jump to any rash conclusionsbut id say hes definitely our prime suspect mulder the man were talking aboutis 77 years old george foremanwon the heavyweight crown at 45 some people are late bloomers anyway this still doesnt explainbjs connection to all this what if its cryptomnesia  consciously forgotten information yeah bjs father was a policeman in the area maybe she heard him discuss the 1942 casewhen she was young or saw cokelys picture that doesnt explain why she unearthedthe grave of an fbi agent what if the recent murders triggeredwhat had been buried in her mind some connection shed unconsciously madethat no one else had  a hunch something like that  thats a pretty extreme hunch youve had some pretty extreme hunches i never have harry cokely  yeah im special agent mulder this is special agent scully were withthe federal bureau of investigation may we come in mr cokely our records show that in 1942you lived in terrance nebraska an hours drive away from aubrey missouri during that time three womenwere murdered in aubrey their assailant mutilated their bodieswith a razor in the same manner that you slashedmrs linda thibedeauxs body in 1945 i dont remember much about that well im sure mrs thibedeauxwill never forget it the doctors said i was sick back then they gave me some pills i served my time and now im better what kind of pills red and white ones little sister do you recognise this man his names chaney no he was an fbi agentwho was also murdered in aubrey in 1942 can you tell me where you wereabout 835pm two nights ago mr cokely  sittin right where i am now do you have a witness to testify to that are you blind i cant leave the housewithout this damn thing i sit right here in front of that tv24 hours a day on the night youre talkin about i wassittin here watchin a show about a lost dog  and after that a show about that wont be necessary good now are you about finished with melittle sister for now aargh i saw it was a womanshe seemed to be in trouble but when i opened the door she barged inand came running down the stairs so i called the police hes here hes here bj what happened  oh my god hes here oh my god im taking her to the hospital thank you i thought you might need these thanks you hurt yourself can you tell us what happened bj cokely he was in the room  cokely attacked you yes he must have done this while i was asleep  youre sure it was him i know it was him i saw his reflection in the mirrorhe looked just like his picture  like his mug shot yes  thats the picture of a young man but it was cokely i swear it was him well ill have tillman pick him up where were you last night honolulu you were in aubrey werent you howd you getinto detective morrows house its all i can do to get to the bathroomyou damn fool  the victim has identified you mr cokely ive already paid for my crime well im gonna see that you pay more i never touched that woman and im not answerin any more questionswithout a lawyer get me a lawyer mulder its open i have the results from the genetic testing ofthe blood found under verna johnsons nails they checked it against cokelys the pgm subtype matchesthe dq alpha and d1s80 too  its cokelys blood the results strongly suggest that imagine the strength of his psychosisdriving him to murder after 50 years  but for some reason he let bj live well shes not the first mrs thibedeaux also survived his attackback in 1945 i think its time we paid a visitto mrs thibedeaux that was taken three weeksbefore it happened i havent had a picture taken since is this your husband thats martin he was a good man he passed last june if it hadnt been for himi never would have survived i know this goes back a long way but could you tell us what happenedthe night cokely attacked you it happened up there on the landing i remember how the light from the window bounced off the razor it had an ivory handle he kept sayin someones gotta take the blamelittle sister and it isnt gonna be me they tried to explain at the trialhow his father used to beat him and how he was the only sonin a family of five daughters and how he was brutally punishedfor everything wrong that happened but if you ask me that man was born evil no children no none our records show that you recuperatedfrom your injuries within two months but nine months lateryou checked back into the hospital well i had complications what happened to the child cokelys child martin used to say not to blame the child that it was just a little thing an innocent but it was the spawn of evil i couldnt keep it in this house the memory of him mrs thibedeaux i gave the baby to an adoption agency baby hed be almost 50 now this is the address of the adoption agency if you do find him no no never mind the bones bj found under the housebelonged to chaneys partner ledbetter cokely rented the house in 1942 detectives at the scene found an old razorunder the house theyre trying to lift prints cokelys been releasedbut i think we have enough to nail him something just doesnt track the night she was attackedbj said she saw a younger man you know her state of mind that nightshe could have been mistaken well maybe she did see a younger manyoung cokely cokelys grandson cokelys grandson attacked bj it would make sensegenetic traits often skip a generation that would explain the bloodunder verna johnsons fingernails pgm subtypes are similar among relatives did danny call backwith the adoption records yet i doubt mendel had serial killers in mindwhen he developed his theory on genetics you know when i was a kidi would have nightmares id wake up in the night thinkini was the only person left in the world then i would hear this  what my dad would be in the study eating these danny valadeo its agent scully what does that have to do with cokely on a cellular level were the sum totalof all our ancestors biological matter but what if more than biological traitsget passed down what if i like sunflower seeds becauseim genetically predisposed to liking them children arent born liking sunflower seedsbehaviour patterns are taught we hear of twins separated at birth who end up in the same occupationeach naming their child waldo waldo jung wrote about the collective unconsciousits genetic memory yeah danny yeah thanks ill tell him danny tracked down mrs thibedeauxs son he was a policemannamed raymond morrow thats bjs father  bj is cokelys granddaughter shes responsible for the murders  mulder get your coat lets go  wait you think bjs capable of murder no but cokely is bj has become him  thats outrageous i think cokelys memories compulsions have been passed on genetically to bjdriving her to kill so bjs nightmares are real shes killingwomen and carving sister on them yes  then explain the cuts on her own chest i cant maybe she did it herself maybe its a weird stigmatawhatever it is bjs not herself  where to to warn mrs thibedeaux if bj has become cokely in the way i meanshe may try to finish what cokely started stop it  somebodys gotta take the blame sister no no no youre not him you cant be and its not gonna be me im not afraid to use this you have his eyes youre him no youre my grandchild  you know what youre doing shut up hes done this to both of us no you dont know what youre doing hes the one to blame argh mrs thibedeaux mrs thibedeaux mulder mrs thibedeaux what happened she had a razor she tried to kill me but something stopped her  where did she go i dont know  can you stand yeah i think so  let me help you up the stairs thank you this is agent mulder i need an ambulanceto 238 north 54th street i also need an apb on bj morrow yes thats detective morrow she shouldbe considered armed and dangerous bjs going after tillman the first murder occurred after bj gotpregnant she wants someone to blame  i think thats tillman i dont think so i think itll be cokely  why she must know cokelys her grandfather if she wants someone to blame itll be him cokelys not answering his phoneim goin over there she had a reason  weve gotta talk were getting a statement  youve accused bj of murder lets go outside  no here now have you seen detective morrow no but i dont care what youve accusedher of she could not hurt anybody detective morrowattacked this woman with a razor  come on i do not believe that its true it happened i only acted like any husbandwho didnt want to see his home broken up  what home remember the home i promised you whos there cokely whos there no how does it feel to beon the other side of the razor brother shut up no no please no you know the rulesthis doesnt stop till youre dead cokely cokely no dont bj
