                man look ben this is whatinfuriatesme  dontyousee  itssopainfullyobvious  why doyou think ourstocks in the toilet  becauseyoure cutting research and development  youve forgotten what the adventures about  the industrys changing  we need to make some choices  saveyour sound bite for the press  lets not relive the stockholders meeting  youre killing me  youre killing my company  eurisko is not your company brad  not anymore  youd damn well better get used to it  youre going to regret this   doorslamming   ben new paragraph  as lm sure everyone on the board will agree  eurisko has to face head on  the realities ofan increasingly competitive world  since the unfortunate departure of brad wilczek l have made  certain recommendations which l believe  will reposition eurisko as an industry leader  at the top ofthis list  is the immediate termination ofthe cos project  lts disastrous performance over the past three quarters  and projected losses well into 1 994  leave us no other choice   waterrunning   ah   telephone ringing   hello hello  at the tone eastern standard time will be 735 pm  what the hell   beep    beep   damn  computer file deleted  mulder  jerry  youre dana scully right  jerry lamana  we worked together in violent crimes  worked together we were partners  thats 850 please  what areyou doing here  looking foryou and lm buying you two lunch  no really  no lts on me  lamana cause ofdeath was electrocution  lt wasnt accidental  lt looks like an elaborate booby trap  we dont know a lot more  building engineer just found him  whos running the investigation  do either ofyou know nancy spiller  the forensics instructor at the academy  we used to call her the lron maiden  on a good day  well anyway shes putting together the squad  and well l took the liberty  ofmentioning your name  lookjerry ld like to helpyou out  but were not on general assignment  because ofthe x files  look the truth is  l could use a little help on this  l dont want to drop the ball on this one  you wont drop the ball  drake wasntjust a ceo ofa fortune 500 company  he was a good friend ofthe attorney generals  a feather in my cap would be nice  the one l got looks mangy  yeah butjerry  look l wouldnt ask ifit wasnt important  scully howcomeyou two wentyourseparate ways  lm a pain in the ass to workwith  seriously  lm not a pain in the ass  we had different career goals  jerrywanted the fifth foor  and you  l was gunning for a basement office  with no heat orwindows  l know whereyou ended up  what aboutjerry  he had bad luck in atlanta  working hate crimes  what kind ofbad luck  he misplaced a piece ofevidence  sent it to the cleaners  by the time he got it back a federal judge  had lost both his hands and his right eye   elevatorbell dings    twentynine  uhhuh  going up  must be for the visually impaired  how doyou like that  a politically correct elevator  third foor  fourth foor  you okay  yeah  what was that   beeping    ringing   man yes  hello  security whos this  this is agent dana scully  ls there a problem  computer fifth foor  uh actually l think everythings okay  ninth foor  tenth foor 1 1 th foor   beeping   lamana someone tampered with the servo  they switched the ground to the negative  so that when he put the key in the lock  scully he completed the circuit  lts fused  lt takes a lot ofjuice to melt a steel key  and to throw a 1 80pound man ten feet  mulder could the servo switch have been moved manually  we didnt find any prints in the surrounding area  sure it could have been but whoever did it  would have had to override the cos  whats the cos  the central operating system  lt regulates everything from energy output  to the volume ofwater in each toilet fush  claude peterson building systems engineer  he discovered the body  what ifsomebodywanted to override the cos  hed have to break the access codes  which wouldnt be easy  mulder we need a list ofpeople with that knowhow  peterson lt will be a short list  would you be on it   me  yeah  hey look  lm just a glorified building super  l just monitor the system make sure its functioning  like when l saw the overload in mr drakes office  does the cos monitor all phone calls  yes it does why  l wasjust wondering  okay um look can l go now  okay  why did you ask him about the phones  phones offthe hook  maybe drake was talking to somebody  right before he did his ben franklin impersonation  taught him everything he knows   knocking   come in  lts past 300  lm just looking for my profile notes  maybe ifyou cleaned your desk more than once a year  theywere right here lm telling you  come on  were late  lamana therearea couple elements forus to considerhere  both the statistical rarity ofhomicidal electrocution  and the complexity ofthe crime  indicate a certain devious premeditation  after all there are much simplerways ofkilling someone  all ofwhich leads me to believe  that our guywas some kind ofsociopathic game player  maybe even a recluse since he designed a trap  not only to avoid detection  but to avoid contact with the victim  but to avoid contact with the victim  ls thatyour profile  forget it huh  drakes final phone call supports this theory  at the tone eastern standard time will be 735 pm  drakes estimated time ofdeath  whywould drake call for the time before he died  lt was an incoming call  from somewhere in the eurisko building itself  whoever set the trap wanted to make sure that drake took the bait  excellent work agent lamana  thankyou  jerry what the hell areyou doing  hey dont get all bent out ofshape  jerry that was my profile  look l didnt think youd mind  anyway theywerejust notes l filled in the blanks  jerry you went into my office and you stole mywork  look youre on this case  cause l asked you to help me out  and you helped me out  what is the big deal  what did he say  he apologized in his own way  l just got offthe phone  with peterson the systems engineer  one name brad wilczek  he said it would be a short list  lts headline news this guy despised drake  that seems too obvious  to kill drake would be so brazenly egomaniacal  and fully consistent  withjerrys excellent behavioral profile  fully  this is what a 220 lq and a 400 million severance settlement buys you  yes  brad wilczek  were with the fbl  what tookyou guys so long  oh doyou mind taking offyour shoes  you can divide the computer science industry  into two types ofpeople neat and scruffy  l take it benjamin drake fit into the first category  neat people like things neat  theywear nicely pressed suits  and work on surface phenomena  things they can understand  market shares and third quarter profits  and you had a different vision  for the company  l started eurisko out ofmy parents garage  l was 22 just spent a year  following around the grateful dead  you know what eurisko means  thats from the greek isnt it  l learn things  not exactly  lt means l discover things  unfortunately ben drake wasnt interested  in discovery  he was a shortsighted powerhungry opportunist  let me showyou the smart home  from this prototype l have access  to every square foot ofmy house  lts as safe as fort knox  and as energy efficient as your average igloo  we were twoyears ahead of microsoft and cebus  when drake in his infinite wisdom killed the program  ls this system related to the one in your building  variation on a theme  how many people know the system well enough to override it  finally the bonus question   not many is the answer  could someone have hacked into the system  well notyour average phone freak thats for sure  but theres plenty ofkooks out there  data travelers electrowizards  technoanarchists  anythings possible  could you have done it  ofcourse  l designed the system  thats whyyou guys are here isnt it  lm your logical suspect  you dont seem too worried  lts a puzzle ms scully  and scruffy minds like me like puzzles  we enjoywalking down unpredictable avenues ofthought  turning new corners  but as a general rule  scruffy minds dont commit murder  scully someseegenius as theability to connect the unconnected  tomakejuxtapositions  toseerelationships where

that eurisko would expand effectively  not by traditional western structures  but by employing certain zen beliefs  and other eastern philosophies   tape rewinding   and other eastern philosophies

could have happened  to anybody  not toyou  dont run yourselfdownjerry  youre a good agent  we did good work together  lets face it  l was tagging along  thats not how it was  how would you know  you were busy  dazzling them on the high wire  mulder take a look  we borrowed this from the voice biometrics lab at georgetown  lts a computer spectrogram  capable ofidentifying individual speech patterns  this is the recording  the central operating system made  ofthe phone call drake received  just before he died  at the tone eastern standard time will be 735 pm  and this we spliced together  from a series oflectures brad wilczek gave  at the smithsonian lastyear   distorted  at the tone eastern standard time will be 735 pm  now well stack them   both voices  at the tone eastern standard time will be 735 pm  youre saying its the same person  lm saying that both voices are brad wilczeks  he may have disguised his voice  but he couldnt alter his speech patterns  which means that he was the one that killed drake  he had the motive and the means  and now we have the physical evidence  judge benson lives in washington heights  l can get a warrant in less than an hour  someone has to watch wilczek  lll go with you  no let me bring him in alone  l need this one mulder  all right   computerkeys clicking   come on come on let me in  damn   enginestarting    enginestarting   mr wilczek  going up  second foor third foor fourth  can l helpyou  fbl  welcome back brad  youre not equipped  with a voice synthesizer  what is my user level  that is now at the discretion  ofthe

executed  l heard aboutjerry  lm sorry  l dont think wilczek did it  what  lt doesnt make sense  whywould he go back to eurisko  to destroy evidence to cover his tracks  lfyou were going to destroy evidence  would you pose for the cameras  mulder  youve been through a lot  more than l think even you realize  l thinkwilczek is smarter than this  hejust signed a confession  how much proof doyou need  this is a crime scene  please leave  l know l ordered the subpoena  that subpoenas been obviated  what areyou talking about  unless youve got a code five clearance  lm going to have to askyou to turn back  thanks for coming  lm here against my betterjudgment  ln the future l must insist  thatyou respect the terms ofour arrangement  l need to know why brad wilczek  is the subject of a code five investigation  what the defense department wants with him  what doyou think theyd want  with the most innovative programmer in this hemisphere  software  foryears wilczek has thumbed his nose  at any contract involving weapons applications  hes a bleeding heart  what kind ofsoftware  how much doyou know  about artificial intelligence  l thought it was only theoretical  lt was until twoyears ago  doyou remember helsinki  the first time a chessplaying computer  beat a grand master  that was wilczeks program  and the rumorwas that he did it  by developing the first adaptive network  an adaptive network  lts a learning machine  a computer that actually thinks  and its uh become something ofa holy grail  for some ofour more acquisitive colleagues  in the department of defense  they make me wear shoes all the time  what else doyou want from me  tell me whyyoure willing to spend your life in prison  for a crime you didnt commit  what areyou talking about  lm guilty  l knowyoure innocent  youre protecting a machine  the central operating system at eurisko  lflm protecting anything its not the machine  then what  after the bomb was dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki  robert oppenheimer spent the rest ofhis life  regretting hed ever glimpsed an atom  oppenheimer may have regretted his actions  but he never denied responsibility for them  he loved the work mr mulder  his mistake was in sharing it with an immoral government  l wont make the same mistake  butyour machine killed drake  and it killed my friend  lm sorry about what happened but theres nothing l can do  and you talk about morality  youre afraid ofthe government  butyoull risk thatyour machine will kill again  the lesser oftwo evils  what about a third option  you created that machine  nowyou tell me how to destroy it  wilczek can createa virus  that will destroy the system  blaming the machine is an alibi a bad one  lts the only thing that makes sense  the cos project  was posting big losses for eurisko  drake was about to terminate the program  so the machine killed drake  out ofselfdefense  selfpreservation  lts the primary instinct ofall sentient beings  that level ofartificial intelligence  is decades away from being realized  then whywas our government  trying to usurp wilczeks research  mulder l thinkyoure looking for something  that isnt there  and l think it has something to do withjerry  maybe it wouldnt be such a bad idea ifyou talked to someone  youre probably right  where areyou going  to talk to someone  how much time doyou need   ringing    whirring mechanicalsound   oh my god   dialing   this is special agent dana scully  ld number 231 761 6  l need you to run a quick trace on a number for me  yeah 2025556431   yeah thats my number  somebodys accessing my computer  mulder  scully what areyou doing here  someone or somethings been scanning my computer files  tapping my phones  l traced the line  lt came from somewhere in there  lts the machine  how can we get in  remember the trojan horse  open sesame  oh what the  mulder   horn blaring    blaringstops   so much for the element ofsurprise  what doyou say we take the stairs   oh great  mulder  trick or treat  no dont  what areyou doing  l dont want to make the mistake drake made   beeping   damn  what areyou looking at  there should be a way foryou to drop down and open the door  come on scully   buzzer   scully  agent mulder  what areyou doing here   airrushing    coughing    screams   the machines been acting all crazy  power surges shutoffs  thats why lm here so late  wheres the b port  oh its right back here  look areyou sure you know whatyoure doing  because ifyou dont its myjob on the line  damn  system access granted  user code level seven  now l can put in the virus  not bad agent mulder  lve been trying  to access the cpu for the past twoyears  now please take outyour gun  and remove the clip  careful  defense department  letsjust say our paychecks are signed by the same person  now give me the diskette  and step away from the console  you dont want to test my resolve agent mulder  put down the gun  look you may thinkyou know whatyoure dealing with  shut up and drop the gun  youre making a mistake agent scully  compromising your sworn duty  this operation is more sensitive than you can possibly imagine  dont listen to him  the technology in this machine  is ofenormous scientific interest  lts killed two people  theywont be able  to handle it any better than wilczek  make no mistake  you will be held accountable  mulder put in the disk  what areyou doing brad  dont do this brad   speaking gibberish   brad brad  brad  why  mulder l talked with congressman klevenaugh  and the department ofcorrections subcommittee  l even petitioned the attorney generals office  you wont find him  they cantjust take a man like brad wilczek  without an explanation  they can do anything theywant  where is he  ln the middle of what we in the trade  call hard bargaining  wilczekwont deal  hell neverwork for them  loss offreedom does funny things to a man  and remember wilczek confessed  to two murders and you effectively destroyed  the only evidence  that could have exonerated him  what else could l have done  nothing  unless you were willing to let the technology survive  the department of defense still hasnt found anything  theyve been on it for five days  wilczeks virus was thorough  lt left no trace ofthe artificial intelligence  the machine is dead  peterson weve pushed the pulse code modulations to the limit  nothing  weve combed the parsing subroutine  yes sir twice  no sir still nothing but ld like to request  yes sir  no l understand  yes sir  well  six more hours  before we have to consign the whole damn thing  to the metal shredder  well do what we can sir  lm going to figure this thing out  ifit kills me
