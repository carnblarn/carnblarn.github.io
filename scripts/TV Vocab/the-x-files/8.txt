ofscientists made up the arctic lce core project  theywere sent to alaska  by the governments advanced research project agency  nearly a year ago to drill into the arctic ice  the samples they removed  contained trapped gases dust chemicals  evidence that could reveal  the structure ofthe earths climate  back to the dawn ofman  theirworkwas a success nearly completed  no reports or indications ofproblems ofany kind  until only a week later  this next transmission was received  werenot  who  weare  werenot  who weare  itgoesno furtherthan this  itstops righthere  rightnow  groan  what happened up there  nobodys been able  to reach the compound because ofbad weather  obviously they think  were either brilliant or expendable  because weve pulled the assignment  ls it severe isolation distress  these were top geophysicists  theywere trained and screened for this project  in everyway imaginable including psychological makeup  we leave for nome today  well meet up with three scientists  familiarwith the project  and then head north up to the lcy cape  the national weather service reports a threedaywindow  to get in and get out before the next arctic storm  bring your mittens  radiofouts looks over the raidersdefense  heres thesnap raidersblitz  fouts dumpsitacross themiddle to winslow  hesat the 15 10 touchdown san diego  touchdown  fouts is god  sorry my team scored  theres no football on wednesday  fouts retired in 87 didnt he  this is some ofmy alltime favorite plays on tape  you two fbl  agent mulder agent scully and you  danny murphy  professor ofgeology uc san diego  you get much ofa chance to study ice down there  just whats around the keg  dr dasilva dr hodge  agent scully agent mulder  nice to meetyou  howyou doing  can l see some identification  what for  l just want to make sure we are who we saywe are  lts me  lts you  lts me  lts you   lts me  thanks a lot  appreciate it  lts you  well now that we know who we are  anybody care to take a guess  as to whywere going  two agents a geologist a medical doctor  and a toxicologist  that should give us some idea  l assumeyou all took a look at the tape  something wrong  come on youre fbl  you have to know more than we do  you folks the ones going up to lcy cape  yeah  then lm fying you my name is bear  the planes across the way  provisions are loaded grabyour gear  oh could we see some credentials  credentials  the only credentials l have  is that lm the only pilot willing to fyyou up there  is that lm the only pilot willing to fyyou up there  you dont like those credentials  walk  bear see ifyou can get the power started  anything to get out ofhere  where do we start  body bags are on the plane  before we touch anything  we have to thoroughly document the scene  scully flashing  mulder thats what theywere drilling for  quarter ofa million years melting away  in a couple ofdays  l want to preserve some samples  rumbling  lts the generator  oh  agent mulder  screaming  barking  hold on  groans  hold it down  that will keep him out for awhile  you okay  yeah he didnt break the skin  bear you okay  he got me  get thatjacket off  give me the stuff lll do it myself  dasilva ls it rabies  l dont see any indications  lfit is rabies  its certainly not a strain lm familiarwith  scully look at this black nodules  swollen lymph nodes  symptoms ofbubonic plague  lll do a blood test well take it from there  this dog has got  a skin irritation on its neck  murphy lt looks like its been scratching off  its own hair  look at this look at this  what the hell was that  groans  from the autopsies  its clear these men killed one another  there are contusions  around the throat areas ofthree men  evidence ofstrangulation  richter and campbell killed themselves  l also found tissue damage due to fever  did any ofthem have  the black spots the dog has  no none ofthem had the black nodules  so uh those spots didnt have anything to do  with those guys killing each other right  l wouldnt rule it out  l just reexamined the dog  the nodules are gone  what could that mean  lt could mean that the spots are a symptom ofsome disease  at an early stage  danny  danny  danny  sorry  the playoffgame against miami 82  helps to get my mind offstuff  my interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos  is a little rusty  murphy all right this is the lcy cape area  lt approximates  the depth ofthe ice sheet  to be about 3000 meters thick  l also found this data  and iflm reading it correctly  the team actually found the ice sheet  to be twice that depth  thats very good  the numbers indicate  the topography to be concave  looks like theywere drilling  inside a meteor crater  hodge no youre wrong  l analyzed two samples  what did you find  theres a presence ofammonium hydroxide  in richters blood sample  lts not possible  ammonia would vaporize at human body temperature  l checked all the air filtration systems  l found no evidence ofany such toxins  l have  ln the ice and thats not all there is  l found a high ratio ofammonia to water  in the ice core  the earths atmosphere could never have produced such levels  even a quarter ofa million years ago  look in the scope  unless a foreign object  was introduced into that environment  murphy tell me thats not a foreign object  scully  that same thing is in richters blood  what ifthat singlecelled organism  is the larval stage ofa larger animal  thats kind ofa leap dontyou think  scully the evidence is there  maybe the organism  in the ice core somehow got into the men  come on nothing can survive  in subzero temperatures for a quarter million years  mulder unless thats how it lives  why areyou squabbling over some bug  you said ityourself scully  your autopsy found those men killed each other  thats it letsjust get the hell out ofhere  l agree  well send the bodies to a facility  where they can make a definitive diagnosis  ln the event that something was missed agent scully  lfthose bodies are infected  we cant take them back  we cant go back without proper quarantine procedures  we cant risk bringing back the next plague  lets say they came down with something  we havent and l aint waiting around until we do  l think its safe to go back  theres no reason whywed be infected  we took the necessary safeguards  the dog did bite bear  ltjumped mulder  theres only one way to proceed  a doctor eliminates every possibility  we must determine ifany ofus is infected  all right parasitic diagnostic procedure  requires that each ofus provide a blood and a stool sample  a stool sample  this kind oftravel always makes that tough for me  mulder anybody got the morning  sports section handy  l aint dropping my cargo for no one  what lm doing is getting  my gear my plane  and fying the hell out ofhere  you cant go the dog bityou  l got hired to fyyou up here and fyyou back  no one said this might be part ofthe deal  so the deal is over  scully we cant let him leave without being checked  scully we cant let him leave without being checked  whos going to stop him  we have to  we cant risk infecting the population  lfhe gets on that plane l will too  theres no time to argue  take a vote  who believes we should confine bear  until he agrees to an examination  all right  bear wejust want to checkyou out  lfwe dont find any trace  ofthe parasite or the virus  well all go  all right  give me the damnjar  murphy get a rope  bear grunting  groaning  oh my god  groaning  oh  get my bag  what areyou gonna do  cutting it out  we know nothing about it  lts killing him  scully help me hold the skin  hold still bear  screaming  forceps  moaning  hodge hold still bear  just another second  youre going to be okay  groaning  agonized moaning  this is the alcp investigative team  calling doolittle airfield come in  daf responding  this is agent mulder  we have a serious biological hazard  request air pickup and quarantine procedures  come in doolittle airfield  we copy thisareais underaheavystorm  noaircraftcangetout forthenextday  maybe themilitarybasein kotzebue cansetupa quarantine  adviseimmediate evacuation  thestorm isbearing inyour direction  we were told wed have three clear days ofweather  welcome to the top ofthe world sir  ls bear in any condition to fy  lfwe dont get out ofhere in an hour  we dont get out for days  hes dead  hodge lts similar to a tapeworm  in that it has a scolex with suckers and hooks  you can deal with it  what  no  very different from any organism  at least that l know of  haveyou figured out how its transmitted yet  exchange offuids touch air all ofthe above  l dont know  all the other dead bodies had the creature  this is the only one thats still alive  were they all in the spine  no lt appears theywere in the hypothalamus gland  deep in the brain  murphy hypothalamus  what was that again  lts a gland that secretes hormones  although l dont know why  a parasite would want to attach to it  hypothalamus releases acetylcholine  which is what produces violent aggressive behavior  that might be a connection  everybody thats been infected  certainly seems to act aggressively  maybe the worm feeds on acetylcholine  which foods our capacity to control violent behavior  a parasite shouldnt want to kill its host  lt doesnt kill you until its extracted  then it releases a poison  youre saying its possible  the worm makes you want to kill other people  which is maybe what happened to the first team  orwhat could happen to us  ltsjust a theory we dont have definite proof  except five dead men  lfthe worm makes people violently aggressive  then why did richter and campbell kill themselves  maybe they did it to save us  lm just uh doublechecking  making sure l didnt miss anything  just some sleep right  sleep lm so tired l cant sleep  were all wired and hypersensitive  lt will be good to get a fresh start in the morning  l dont want to waste a second  finding a way to kill this thing  l dont know ifwe should kill it  this area ofthe ice sheet is formed over a meteor crater  the worm lives in ammonia  lt survives subzero temperatures  theorists in alternative life designs believe in  ammoniasupported life systems on planets with freezing  no  the meteor that crashed here  may have carried that type oflife to earth  mulder that pilot developed surface symptoms  within a few minutes  within a few hours that parasite had total control  what would happen ifthis got into the population  a city the size of new york  could be infected within a few days  exactly but what do we know about it  this organism might be lying dormant in another crater  lfwe dont kill it now we run the risk  ofbecoming richter and campbell with guns to our heads  lfwe kill it we wont know  how to stop anything like it in the future  scully future  lndistinct arguing  tell me its hot in here  dont worry you dont have a fever  heating systems malfunctioning  outside its 40 below and in here its sweltering  can you hear what theyre arguing about  theyre probably discussing their little government secrets  you think they knew what was here before we arrived  lm sure ofit  scully biological hazard  you know bears infected blood did get on scully  lt also got on you  how doyou know it cant be contained  lt can by extermination  we should take those bodies  worms and all outside and incinerate them  something going on we should know about  agent scully you all right  yes lm fine lts nothing  you seem a little stressed out  what the hell areyou saying  lets all settle down  lts been a hard day  were all tired and scared  lets not turn on one another  at least not without a good reason  mulder we should all get some sleep  you kidding  you think any ofus could sleep right now  guys lets face it  we got to check for spots  any person or persons who has them should be confined  are we agreed on that  areyou going to do the exams  no  we do them in front ofeach other  no secrets  before anyone passesjudgement may l remind you  we are in the arctic  sleep tight  dont let the bedbugs bite  dasilva yeah good night  good night mulder  good night scully  at least everyones okay  dont forget  the spots on the dog went away  ballon the threeyardline  fourthandgoal with only 15seconds leftin thegame  hemoves overtheball heres thesnap  hegoes over  gasps  door closes  barking  dripping  mulder what areyou doing  murphys dead  you killed him  l found him like this  l heard one ofthe doors close  l came out to check it out  lt was one ofyou  you could have done it and not known  he said he didnt  l have no symptoms  you checked him  six hours ago  lt was one ofyou  stop it shut up  put the gun down and let  hodge giveyou a blood test  hell doctor the results  l wont let him stick a needle in me  he has to be confined now  turn around and let us take a look atyour neck  lm not turning my back on anyone  as far as lm concerned youre all infected  hodge is right we ought to lock him up  mulder  scully get that gun offme  you have to understand  put it down  you first  scully  for gods sakes its me  mulder you may not be whoyou are  ln here lll be safer than you  gasping  what wereyou doing  you know what l was doing  l cant help thinking agent scully  youre the only one with a gun  lfyou get infected we dont stand a chance do we  okay  was there something there  hodge youre okay nancy  were all okay  now is not the time for the three ofus  to break down and turn on each other  theres four ofus  mulder isnt one ofus  lf mulder is infected its not his fault  we cant turn our backs on him now  he needs us to help him  shes right  who knows  what prolonged exposure to the parasite could do  lt could damage him to the point ofpermanent psychosis  lfhe is infected he doesnt go back  l wont risk the possibilities  this is alcp calling doolittle airfield  please come in  static  this is the arctic lce corps project  sending a general distress call  please respond  static  nancy put a drop ofthe uninfected blood  on the slide ofthe blood drawn from the pilot  run that by me again  put the uninfected blood on the infected blood  no damn it  what did l just tell you  you infected already infected blood  we have to start over again  l made a mistake dontyell at me  wasted hours ofwork  maybeyou should do it byyourself damn it  lm notyour assistant  hodge  what  come take a look at this  the larvae from two different worms killed each other  an individual worm will not tolerate  another invading its host  lt does to the invader what it did to humans  lt makes them kill  hodge but the species needs another to procreate  worms are hermaphroditic  lt can reproduce itself  look at the evidence in the microscope  this thing does not like company  what areyou saying  the way to kill it  is to introduce anotherworm  into an already infected body  whining  lt sounds okay  lt passed the worms in its stool  theyre dead  l want to talk to him first  try and make this voluntary  what  you cant go in alone  lfanything happens you come inside  l cant do this to him until lm sure  door opening  ltsjustyou  yes  lts one ofthem  no ones been killed sinceyouve been in here  so  we found a way to kill it  two worms in one host will kill each other  you give me one worm youll infect me  lfthats true  then why didntyou let us inspectyou  l would have butyou pulled a gun on me  now l dont trust them  l want to trustyou  okay  but now theyre not here  this is the last one  shes not going to let us give it to him  well shell have to ifhes infected  hell convince her somehow  l just examined him  hes uninfected  so is she  which means that it must be one ofyou  all right  lets go over to the main building  ld like to check him myself  then he can examine both ofus  you want to lead the way  no  get the worm  dont  oh my god  screaming  lts her  no  no  scully  lts dasilva  screaming hysterically  dasilva no  hodge now  mulder  after this there wont be any left  theyre all going to be dead  do it  dasilva screaming  no  shh shh  no  shh shh  shh shh  moaning  lts all right  lts all over  lt all stops right here  right now  okay lock her down  shes being put in quarantine along with the dog  well keep her there until were sure  she wont infect the rest ofthe population  our tests came back normal so weve been released  plane ready  lt will takeyou as far from the ice as you want to go  lm going back to the site  this time lm going fully prepared  with proper equipment  theres a lot ofresearch to be done on the genetic structure  on its origins  mulder dontyou know  know what  they torched the place  theres nothing left  who did that  the military  the center for disease control  you ought to know  theyreyour people  lts still there scully   ln the ice  leave it there
