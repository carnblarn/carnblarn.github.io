attacks over the last 28 years occurring in every statein the continental us almost the first in oregon the last five in florida victims range from all differentage groups races both male and female the mutilations appear so motivelessone would suspect a form of ritual yet they adhere to no known cult a serial killer would normally escalatethe level of violence of his attacks over such an extended period of time so what do you think scullywhat are your initial thoughts imagine going throughyour whole life looking like this the lord is my shepherdi shall not want he maketh me to lie

surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell inthe house of the lord forever we are gathered here today to mournthe passing of jerald glazebrook beloved husband fatherfriend and entertainer we mourn not only the passing of a man who overcamethe obstacles of his earthly incarnation but also the passing of the lovethat dwelled within his alltoohuman heart we mourn the passing ofthe admiration and the respect he instilled in allof his professional colleagues we mourn the passing ofthe laughter and the enjoyment he brought each audience who saw him for although jerry wasa worldrenowned escape artist there is one strongboxfrom which none of us can escape help me put him down over there not having known the deceased personallyim in no position to perform a proper eulogy im sure he was a nice guyet cetera et cetera but as an admirer of his worki am in a position to perform an impromptu tributein his honour namely ramming this spike into my chest  dont you have any respect i think i hit my left ventricle get back fascists get him outta here i cant wait for the wake on his vicap formjerald glazebrook was listed as an artist jerry was an artistthe best escape artist since houdini he shouldve been headlining vegas but hiscondition kept him on the sideshow circuit  i didnt realise that sideshows still existed there are two or three still around i got the impression that glazebrookwasnt the only performer residing here the town was founded in the 20swhen some of barnum  baileys troupes came down in the winter offseasons this towns history might helpexplain our cases history a sideshow performerwould have toured much of the country and their isolation from societycaused by their physical deformities could have built uppathological resentment now now hold on a second now now hold on a second around here we refer to themas very special people they may be different on the outsidebut its whats inside that counts and on the insidetheyre as normal as anybody and on the insidetheyre as normal as anybody until arrest many serial killers are considered by their friendsand family to be quite normal if you regard them as normalyou must consider the possibility that they are capableof committing these crimes its been my experiencethat other people have a harder time accepting these peoples deformitiesthan they do themselves sheriff uh what is this this design here its copyrightedby hepcat helm is that a local artist a bit too local his workplaceis right behind my station house do you think that we could meet hepcat  watch my eyes when you light them up  listen to me whine like a heart shook up hepcat hepcat  im in a frenzy  who are the rubes these are fbi agents scully and mulder this is hepcat helmhe

fiji mermaid  is that what that thing is whats the fiji mermaid the fiji mermaid its its the fiji mermaid its a bit of uh humbugbarnum pulled in the last century barnum billed it as a real live mermaidbut when people went in to see it all they saw was a real dead monkeysewn onto the tail of a fish  a monkey a mummified monkey it supposedly looked so badhe had to exhibit it as a genuine fake but see thats why barnum was a genius you never know where the truth endsand the humbug begins he came right out and said thisfiji mermaid thing is just a bunch of bs that just made people wanna go and see iteven more so i mean who knows maybe for boxoffice reasons barnumhawked it as a hoax when in reality the fiji mermaid was a reality sheriff were gonna needa place to stay tonight there are lodgings right across the waybut uh whats all this about these tracks were foundat several past crime scenes theyve defied identification but one expert speculatedthat they might be simian in nature youre not telling me these trackswere made by the fiji mermaid do you recall what barnumsaid about suckers tell me have you done muchcircus work in your life and what makes you think ive ever spectateda circus much less been enslaved by one many citizens here were circus handsand i thought you thought that becausei am a person of short stature that the only career i could procure formyself would be one in the socalled big top you took one quick look at me and decidedthat you could deduce my entire life never would it have occurred to youthat a person of my height could have possibly obtained a degree in hotel management  im sorry i meant no offence well then why should i take offence just because its human natureto make instantaneous judgments of others based solely upontheir physical appearances ive done the same thing to you for example ive taken in your allamerican features your dour demeanouryour unimaginative necktie design and concludedthat you work for the government an fbi agent but do you see the tragedy here i have mistakenly reduced youto a stereotype a caricature instead of regarding youas a specific unique individual but i am an fbi agent register here please tell me have you done muchcircus work in your life i was on the stage for most of my life i was a headliner did it not bother youto have people staring at you best work i ever hadall i had to do was stand there occasionally id say ladies and gentlemenid like you to meet my brother leonard excuse himhes a little shy big laughs i tell you big laughs why did you give it up mr nutt the

wrong oh thats most consideratethank you very much goodnight sleep tight dont let the bedbugs bite no no thats not what i meant i didnt mean to imply we had bedbugs i meant to say dont let dont let the the fiji mermaids bite yes thats right the fiji mermaidsthats right thats thats exactly mulder what is this fiji mermaid business every murder inquiry begins witha list of possible suspects you should try not to be so exclusive scully as long as you try not to let the atmospherehere distort your list all out of proportion  im in a frenzy  frenzy  this love gushes from my heart  like water from a spout  you build a flame from a tiny spark  you can really knock me out yeah  ease my mind with your real cool line  daddy fill my soul with love divine  when you say youre mine oh mine  im in a frenzy what the hell uh maam the sheriff he wants to see you theres been another murder theres some blood on the windowwe should send to the lab  why run a test on the victims blood no not this window this window it seems to be the point of entry and theressome blood on the outside of the window why would there be blood before the attack why didnt the attackerjust come through the open door for a person to crawlin and out of these windows theyd have to be a contortionist or just plain crazy or both while theyre performingthe autopsy i wanna go down to the how many people do you know that can getout of a straitjacket in under three minutes fortunately none we caught your act at the funeralthat was some trick with the railroad spike doctor blockhead does not perform tricks doctor blockhead performs astounding actsof body manipulation and pain endurance you must be one of those rare individualswhose nerve endings dont register pain you just keep tellin yourself that have you ever performed thisact on anyone else are you sick i tell audiences if theyrestupid enough to try this themselves theyll end up with a slight lobotomyi am a professional exactly how does one becomea professional blockhead may i in my homeland of yemeni studied with yogis fakirs and swamis learning the ancient artsof body manipulation but most men know nothing of these arts did you know that throughthe chinese practice of tie bu shan you can train your testiclesto draw up into your abdomen im doing that as we speak i saw him this morning by the riverhe was eating a fish he knows betweenshow snacksllruin his appetite i could be mistaken maybe it was anotherbald jigsawpuzzletattooed naked guy is this man also a body manipulator no in the classical sensethe conundrums a geek  he eats live animals he eats anything live animals dead animals light bulbscorkscrews battery cables cranberries  human flesh only the conundrum can answer that but he doesnt answer questionshe merely poses them when an audience partakes inthe conundrums human piranha act they are left to ask themselves why but where are my manners thank you its an old sleight of handmy uncle taught me he was only an amateur magicianbut he was better than those two ill go to the lab to testthe blood on the window against the blood on blockheads nail everybodys uncles an amateur magician welcome to my museum may i put to rest any questionsyou may have conjured i was just reading aboutthe fascinating life of chang and eng and uh wonderingif their death was just as fascinating oh very much so on a cold january eve in 1874 eng awoke to find his brother hadpassed away during the course of the night a few hours latereng himself departed from this world now these facts themselves may beless than fascinating but imagine imagine being eng and lying there knowing that essentiallyhalf your body was now dead that the rest must inevitably follow and being able to do about it absolutely nothing at the autopsy it was officially concludedthat chang died of a cerebral haemorrhage  what was the official cause of engs death fright do you have any informationon blockhead or geek acts this is an historical collectionon human curiosities  blockheads are skilled performers like magicians like sword swallowerswho really do swallow swords and geeks are neither skilled nor curiositiestheyre merely unseemly  not even attaining the level of gaffs gaffs observe closely the dissimilarityof the facial features conjoined twins are always identical these gentlemen are phonies gaffs sort of like the fiji mermaid youre investigatingthe alligator mans murder yes i have something i believeyou might find of some interest what does this have to do withthe glazebrook murders ive recently come into possessionof an authentic pt barnum exhibit i dont show this displayto all my customers  only those with the intellectualcuriosity to appreciate it barnum billed it as a great unknown i must first ask of you two favours tell no soul what you witness in here  and the second favour an additional donation of five dollars does agent scully knowthat youre under her crawlspace i was merely repairingthe plumbing on this unit i know what youre thinking my friendbut you are grossly mistaken not being of socalled average height doesnot mean i must get my thrills vicariously not all women are attracted tooverly tall lanky men such as yourself youd be surprised how many womenfind my size intriguingly alluring youd be surprised how many men do too ach oh its youhas mr nutt finished with the plumbing the blood samples matched but were bothopositive they went for further analysis i ran a background checkon doctor blockhead his real name is jeffrey swaimand he wasnt born in yemen he was born in milwaukeehe does not hold a doctorate i ended up running a bit ofa background check myself  on who on an orphan discovered in the wild forestsof albania in 1943 although adept at catching his own food he could not speaksave for a few savage grunts brought to this country he was exhibited ina locked cage owing to his feral ferocity where he would terrify onlookersby devouring chunks of raw meat for reasons i could not ascertainhe ran away from the circus and spent a number of years roaming abouttaking on a number of nondescriptjobs eventually he wound up in gibsontonwhere he began a career in law enforcement and has spent the pastfour terms serving as sheriff youre talking about sheriff hamilton before becoming sheriff hamilton james hamilton wasjimjim the dogfaced boy you know scully hypertrichosisdoes not connote lycanthropy  what are you implying were being discriminatory just because a man was once overly hairywhy suspect him of aberrant behaviour  like assuming guilt based on skin colour yeah may i ask what youre doing were exhuming your potato may i ask why its been documented that many serial killerspossess a fascination with police work some of them even holdingpositions on their local force so surveillance of investigationteam members is often utilised as a we found out you used to bea dogfaced boy boy look how skinny i was back then  so that is you oh sure i spent the first half of my life as jimjim one day i noticed a bald spot on my head and realised i was losing my hairand my career as well eventually all the hair went on top of my head anyways the rest of my bodys still pretty hairywhich is why i never go to the beach that doesnt quite explain the potato i got uh some warts on my hand that doesnt quite explain the potato to get rid of warts you rub a sliced potatoon your hand and bury it under a full moon the investigation isntgoing too well is it so tell me commodore why are the weirdos the only onesthat pay their rent cheques in advance i warn you you tattooed cretin i have a licensed firearm and i am morethan eager for an opportunity to use it i found him hes dead hes dead lanny says all the doors andwindows were locked from the inside scully come here he was like a brother to me i dont know if a contortionist could getthrough that doggy door but look at this lanny lanny take it easy youre gonna hurt yourself  so what so you might hurt me in the process he gets this way sometimesill have to toss him in the drunk tank well take jeffrey swaim into custody come on lanny lets go you know mulder for a while i was beginning to suspect this caseinvolved something a bit more freakish you shouldnt complain about banality when your main suspectis the human blockhead its open mr swaim federal agents were here to its a variation ofan american indian sun dance ritual i suspend myself by these hooks and the pain becomesso unbearable i leave my body if people knew the true price of spiritualitythered be more atheists were taking you into custodyto question you about some murders i dont answer till i talk to my lawyer  whos your lawyer i represent myself if youre uncooperativeill have to handcuff you what gives you fasciststhe right to do that  did i not say were federal agents did i not say im an escape artist mulder are you okay its more comfortable than a futon hey look what i caught ouch what the hell no nooo nooo this has all the makings of those mistakenidentity miscarriageofjustice things that prove so popular on 60 minutes  is this yours the fifth amendment says  what is that its lanny in the drunk tank hell be all right once he sleeps it off no i dont thinkhes gonna sleep this one off theres been another attack how could anyone have gotten in there no one got in but someone got out  what are you talking about im not sure myself but well know more when we find leonard  leonard lannys brother oh god they extracted the twin no the twin extracted itself  but its an appendage yeah mulder this wound is identical to the other victims with one exception hes not bleeding if youre trying to tell me his twin can crawlout of his body youre as drunk as he is you said it yourself sheriffits whats inside that counts i suspect that lanny has an internal anomalythat allows his conjoining twin to disjoin but how how how could i turn him inwithout turning myself in lanny why does he attack other people i dont think he knows hes harming anyone he is merely seeking another brother are you in pain lanny it hurts it hurts not to be wanted i dont know why he hates me so ive taken care of him for all of our lives maybe that is the reason why how long can he surviveoutside of your body long enough to understand that you cannot changethe way you were born dont worry hell come back he always does im still his only brother sheriff were gonna need the paramedics scully youre the medical expertand you say the twin can disengage but how mobile could such a thing be too mobile so your twin can uh and then what an act ill cover the back freeze the fun house i thought i heard a shot fired i think wed better go outsideand catch this thing coming out its the managers dog the trailer park  are you all right have you seen a uh uh check out the area behind that trailerand let me know what you find all right youre sure it was the twin you saw here maybe it was the fiji mermaid and he jumped back in the riverand swam back to fiji now you know how i feel  youre takin off are you kidding with that on the loose theyve been searching for it all dayit cant have survived for this long itll probably try to crawlback up into its brother no his brother lanny died last nighti performed the autopsy on him this morning so i guess its trueyou can never go home again his body wounds were nonfatal he died as a resultof advanced cirrhosis of the liver oh theres a moral to this storylay off the booze well his body possessessome anatomical discrepancies offshoots of the oesophagus and tracheathat almost seem umbilical in nature i  ive never seen anything like it and you never will again will eradicate siamese twinsand alligator people youll even be hardpressed to finda slight overbite or a notsohigh cheekbone you see ive seen the futureand the future looks just like him imagine living your whole lifelooking like that thats why its left to selfmade freaks likeme and the conundrum to remind people remind people of what nature abhors normality it cant govery long without creating a mutant  do you know why no why i dont either its a mystery maybe some mysteriesare never meant to be solved  whats the matter with your friend i dont know what his problem is  maybe its the florida heat hope its nothing serious probably somethin i ate i made this
