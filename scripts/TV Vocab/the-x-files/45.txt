over roll over  so they all rolled over and one fell out  three in the bed and the little one saidroll over roll over  so they all rolled over and one fell out  two in the bed and the little one said teddy teddy teddy teddy teddy teddy teddy  theres a kid on the track oh my god teddy teddy get away from there teddy teddy come here damn teddy tell teddy to get off the track no oh my god teddy maggie teddy this was takenat an amusement park three months ago the young boy in the backgroundis teddy holvey aged two  he was killed seconds after this was taken how according to the police report he wanderedin front of the miniature train the conductor was unable to stopdue to malfunctioning brakes teddys dad worksfor the state department a coroners inquest was held due tothe unusual circumstances of the accident  did the inquest find anything unusual no but the county medical examiner wasdisturbed by this case and by this photo and i think with good reason you see this is a helium balloon one thing i learnt in kindergartenis when you let them go they float up  but this is moving away horizontally did you learn about wind in kindergarten the national weather service sayon that day the wind was blowing north but the balloon is moving southas if its being pulled against the wind  pulled by whom i dont know so i came to chuckthe king of digital imaging chuck can extract incredibly small detailsfrom a photographic print not details information watch the monitor we have limitations on how muchthe eye can perceive unaided but with this special software which idesigned we can detect hidden information we can manipulate it enhance it now watch right here there it is its clearly a concentrationof electromagnetic energy so youre saying that uha ghost killed teddy holvey did anyone checkthe camera that took the photo  the lens or the pressure plate it all checked out scully i think this is clearlysome kind of poltergeist activity this is the same reasonwhy youll see a newspaper photo with jesus face appearingin the foliage of an elm tree its a chance occurrence of light and shadow to get on the tracks teddy holveyescaped this childproof halter that his mom had tied to a sink ive seen some slippery twoyearolds so the cme put it on his own twoyearold and found it was impossiblefor the kid to free himself so unless teddy wasthe reincarnation of houdini and that would be an xfile in itself i dont understandtheres already been a formal inquest were here apart from that investigation we believe somethingmay have been overlooked like what the possibility teddymay have been helped onto the tracks  oh my god there were over a hundred witnesses we saw teddy ourselves he was chasinga balloon there was no one else around it was an awful accidentbut thats all it wasan accident do you have any reason to suspectsomeone may have wanted to hurt teddy he was just a babywhy would anybody want to hurt him i dont know what youregetting at we loved teddy if youre suggesting this is like that womanwho drowned her kids youre way out of line mrs holvey did you hear anything in thebathroom right before teddy disappeared i already told the inquest i heard nothing mrs holvey at the time of the accidentdid you have any hired help no my mother came to live with usonce teddy was born around the time of teddys death had younoticed anything strange happening things moved odd objects appearing its that damn smoke detectorill be right back does this happen often its an old housewe have a problem with the wiring speaks romanian  mother diavolo mother it was just a false alarm no speaks romanian mother stop it what is she saying  maggie you marry a devil you have devil child im sorry dyou recognise this  its a swastika its also known as a gammadion or a fylfot its an ancient symbolused for protection or good luck used by various culturessince the middle ages the child had one onthe back of his hand last night my guess it was drawnby the old ladyto protect the boy  yes i saw her drawing it you didnt think that was strange i think this boy needsas much protection as he can get but just not from ghostiesor beasties look at this have you ever heard ofmnchhausen by proxy yeah my grandfather usedto take it for his stomach when a parent or caretakerbrings harm to a child by inducing symptoms usually asa way of getting attention or status look at teddys medical history youll see that he was admittedto various hospitals ten times during the two years he was alivethats once every three months projectile vomiting at three months diarrhoea at four monthsvomiting diarrhoea diarrhoea each time they were unableto determine the cause  and no one questioned this the family moved around with steves job records take time to transferfrom hospital to hospital but this abuse is not limited to just one childso i checked out charlies history as well  he had medical problems too since his brother was born which is right whenholveys motherinlaw moved in often the perpetrator of mnchhausenby proxy will view the child as evil the old woman would be a likely candidatebut it could be any family member do you feel like taking a walkover to the state department scully things have been strange since goldamy motherinlaw moved in with us i met maggie in romania in 1984 golda forbade our marriagesaid i was the devil after i transferred back to the usthings got somewhat better until teddy was bornand she came to live with us thats when the strangeness really started what kind of strangeness superstitions rule goldas life shell spit if anyone compliments the kids once she moved in she poured hot waterover the threshold to ward off demons tied red strings around the kids wrists one day i caught herthrowing chicken guts on the roof then teddy and charliestarted getting sick a lot  and you suspect golda shell call charlie evil right to his face but at the same time she dotes on himlike shes afraid of him afraid of him or for him i just dont know are you familiar withmnchhausen by proxy are you accusing us of child abuse teddys medical recordshave raised some questions i could never say this to maggie but lve wondered if it wasnt golda who snuckin and let teddy out of the bathroom that day id like to interview your son charlie mrholvey but with a professional counsellor this is gonna be hard  maggie what do they want to take charlie away they just want himto talk with a social worker  theyll put lies into charlies head youre being unreasonable you want to take him away you blame mefor teddy and you want to take him away i wont listen to this this is ridiculous if youwanna come you can im taking charlie now no steven  what was that speaks romanian come on charlie lets get your coat  you have no right to do this maggie come on well meet you out front  ok you buckled in there yeah dammit no no daddy no noooo no daddy no mulder daddy daddy no daddy no daddy daddy you see this  find anything yeah maybe it looks like ash yeah its everywhere look at this the holveys said earlierthey had problems with the wiring  it could be the motor shorted out no the motors fine  what do you think it is i dont know but ill have this analysed before we do anythingwe should get charlie out of here i called a social workerwhos gonna come down and make a report  the courts will be reluctant to intervene not when a child is in danger and not after they see two dead roostersin the old womans bedroom really  still think this is mnchhausen by proxy without a doubt  what did you do i didnt do anything stay away from our house  hey you wanna see something weird what chem lab analysis ofthe ash from the holveys house no trace of any metalno carbon no oxygen no nothing  what do you mean it contains nothing organic or inorganic in fact according to the techniciansthis ash doesnt exist come on  where are we going to get a second opinion oh wow havent seen this for a whilenot since india 1979  india before chuck succumbed to academia he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail its called vibuti holy ash technically its called an apport something that materialises out of thin air wait a secondnothing materialises out of thin air youve read the bible rememberjesus creating the loaves and the fishes  yeah but that was a parable in 1979 i witnessed a guru named sai baba create an entire feast out of thin air too bad you didnt take a picture and useyour computer to see the entire last supper vibuti is created during the presenceof spirit beings or during bilocation which is a phenomenon where a personsenergy is transported to a different location that energy could have beenwhat set off the garagedoor opener yeah thator somebodyactivated the remote control well who are you
