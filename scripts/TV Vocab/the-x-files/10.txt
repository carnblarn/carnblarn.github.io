soldiers chattering  thats your unit sir  where is he  hes gone they got to him first  they beat us colonel  arrest him  and keep looking  agent scully  to the best ofyour knowledge was agent mulder ever assigned  to investigate matters related to the evacuation  oftownsend wisconsin  no sir  at any time  wereyou aware ofhis submitting a form 302  requesting said assignment or travel expenses  no sir  while in wisconsin  did agent mulder drive a blue ford taurus  registered to the state car rental agency  yes sir  thankyou agent scully  sir request permission to make a statement  request denied  sir its unfair tojudge mulder by the same criteria  youre dismissed  but sir  that will be all  you hear that noise scully  hammer and nails  theyre building a gallows in the town square  dont worry  lt was only a matter oftime  lm surprised l lasted this long  good luck  lll break a leg  mcgrath as well as insubordination and misconduct  how doyou respond to these allegations agent mulder  over a dozen men lost their lives  and you want me to respond to issues ofprotocol  you failed to obtain proper authorization foryour actions  l knew it wouldnt be forthcoming  you also violated a federal quarant  a coverup was underway  exposing yourself and possibly others  to toxic contamination  oh toxic contamination are we back in that  you read my report  explain max fenigs disappearance  your report is not the subject ofthis inquiry  x rays taken while mr fenig was institutionalized  showed an object lodged in his cerebellum  that is irrelevant agent mulder  the man was abducted  everybody in this room knows it  colonel hendersons written testimony states  that fenigs body was found two hours later  in a cargo container  then what can l say  how can l disprove lies that are stamped  with an official seal  that will be all mr mulder  sighing  you can deny all the things lve seen  all the things lve discovered but not for much longer  cause too many know whats happening out there  and no one no government agency  hasjurisdiction over the truth  why did you countermand our decision  mulders conduct was in clearviolation  not only of bureau procedures but of federal law  yes  l dont understand  the committees case was airtight  youve ruined the last best chance we had  to get rid ofhim  l appreciate your frustration  butyou and l both know that mulders work  his uh singular passion  poses a most unique dilemma  but his occasional insubordination  is in the end far less dangerous  with respect sir  less dangerous than what  than having him exposed to the wrong people  what he knows  what he thinks he knows  sighing  always keepyour friends close mr mcgrath  but keepyour enemies closer
