                man 1  youre supposed to be in charge here perkins  man 2 i am in charge  man 1  these men want answers theywant to know whatyour plan is  this thing could kill us all  man 2 we should have left two days ago no one would listen to me  man 1  nobody knew what it was two days ago nobody knows now  somebody has to go for help  what are the rest ofus supposed to do  wait for help  someone has to chance it  and hike out  that person might not make the road before nightfall  then what  i saywe run for it  split up take our chances  its suicide dyer  fine  you stay here  tell us how it turns out  panting  grunting  labored breathing  i think its broken  you got to get up  i cant make it  groaning  we got to keep moving  grunting  were not going to make it  distant humming  humming growing louder  dyer screaming  take a good look scully  what am i looking at  a clearcutting contract  in washington state  rugged manly men  in the full bloom oftheir manhood  what am i looking for  anything strange unexplainable unlikely boyfriend  i dont know  i give up mulder  funny thats what the federal forest service  has done as well  why what happened to them  in a word theyvanished  or so it would appear  this is doug spinney and steven teague  they call themselves monkeywrenchers  they drive spikes into trees  sabotage logging equipment and make life miserable  for lumberjacks and lumber mills  ecoterrorists militant environmentalists  right two weeks ago  the loggers radioed a message  that spinney and teague had gone on a spree  sabotaging equipment causing general mischief  one week later  all radio communication was cut off  do they know why  no the lumber company  asked the federal forest service to look into it  two officials went in last week no one has heard from them  it appears as if these monkeywrenchers  are doing more than mischiefmaking  thats what the lumber company and forest service are accusing  theyve asked the fbi to investigate  i had to pull strings to get the case  an ecoterrorism case  do i dare askwhy  in 1 934 long before anyone knew what an ecoterrorist was  a wpa crew  working that same area vanished without a trace  none ofthose men was ever found or heard from again  and you suspect what bigfoot  not likely  thats a lot offannel to be choking down  even for bigfoot  come on it will be a nice trip to the forest  hi fox mulder dana scully were with the fbl  larry moore federal forest service  you can putyour gear in the truck  must be pretty rugged where were going  yeah  is that a bullet hole in yourwindshield  22 caliber  somebody shot atyou  theres not much to hunt around here  with that ammo except freddies   freddies  employees of the federal forest service  its what ecoterrorists call us  is that whoyou think shot atyou  let me get this out ofthe way  i have no quarrel with ecoterrorists in principle  im as concerned for this forest  and the environment as anybody  its their methods i cant condone  doyou think theyd kill a man  theres 30 men up there unaccounted for  each with survival experience  something happened to them  sorry im late  i was down talking to bob perkins wife  hes one ofour missing loggers  hey larry  steve humphreys head ofsecurity  for schifflmmergut lumber  mulder scully  weve got a fourhour drive ahead ofus  plenty oftime to get acquainted  get the impression  weve walked into the middle ofa war  thats already started  why do these men  work so far up in the wilderness  thats where the trees are  youre kidding right  no environmentalists have made sure  that all the land here is untouchable  we take our timber where we can get it  even then we plant saplings for every tree we take  so why do ecoterrorists targetyou  tree huggers are like the boys  who went up to canada during the vietnam war  theyre cowardly and so are their tactics  damn it  homemade tire spike  clear through the sidewall  its unfixable  you got a spare  humphreys right tires history too  monkeywrenchers call it a caltrop  roads back here are littered with them  indiscriminate terrorism  can you imagine somebody  spiking the roads ofwashington dc  how much sympathy would they get  so how are we going to get to the camp  were going to have to hike  anybody here  someone forgot to clean their plate  scully looks like they left in a hurry too  they forgot to pack  find anything  party favors  vehicles have all been monkeywrenched  power generators busted  somebody really turned this place upside down  whoever did it didnt want the fact broadcast either  radiators are all full ofrice  looks like sugar or sand in all the crankcases  they really did a number here  the suns going down in an hour and a half  better look around before it gets dark  ill see ifl can get that generatorworking  you were right about one thing  whats that  definitelywasnt bigfoot  look at that  scully what is it  moore it looks like a hive  maybe a cocoon ofsome kind  made bywhat  i dont know  ive never seen anything like it  got it  can you cut it down  yeah i think so  you all right scully  scully oh god  it feels uh  it feels desiccated hard and dry  almost preserved  like its been embalmed  no more like the fuids have been bled  from its body  almost like its been cured  i think  its a male  barely  id say its some kind ofspiders nest  or insect cocoon  what kind ofinsect could have gotten a man  all the way up into that tree  itsybitsy spider  creaking  clanking  dont move  who areyou  doug spinney  i ought to shootyou  might as well shootyourselftoo  youre in a spot to be testing me  what happened to my men  what men  the men who were working this camp  i dont know  probably the same thing  will happen to us when the sun goes down  what areyou doing  this animals doug spinney  hes responsible for all the monkeywrenching  hes probably a murderer  im no murderer  youre a liar  lets hear him out  ifwe stand around there will be nothing left to say  think about getting that generator started  darkness is our enemy  whats he talking about  someone want to give me a hand  now hes giving orders  im the one  who fixed the damn thing  mulder its all right  why did you say that darkness was our enemy  thats when they come  when who comes  i dont know what it is  they come from the sky take a man right offhis feet  and devour him alive  i saw it happen  happen to who  engine sputtering  ldling smoothly  i need to eat  i havent eaten in three days  what kind of bs story is that huh  you believe that  we found something in the forest  what  a man caught in some kind  ofinsect cocoon  what happened here  we camped two valleys over four ofus  three now  more rats in the woodpile  our truck has a dead battery  we drew straws to see who would make the hike  to steal one from the loggers  why notjust hike out  its over a days hike  no waywe wanted to be caught in the forest after dark  not after what happened to teague  thats the man you said was devoured alive  yeah  why areyou out here  camping  the kind ofcamping you do is a federal offense  just hold offa second okay  no hes right  this man is an admitted felon  he could be arrested  what aboutyour offense my friend huh  what aboutyour offense against nature  we operate within the law  we pay for the right to take those trees  well your logging crew is taking trees  that are marked and protected  so dont talk to me about breaking the law  sir  theyve taken marked trees  yes sir marked in orange  old growth trees  you know anything about that steve  no  you going to take this mans word  over mine  you dont want to go out in the night  take myword on that  its out there  ifl go out that door  somethings going to eat me and spin me in its web  yes  its too polite to come in here  and get me  for some reason its uh afraid ofthe light  its afraid ofthe light  there may be something to what hes saying steve  hes a murderer clever enough to make up a story like that  even whip up that cocoon to save a few trees  and im going to prove im right  this is ridiculous  where is it spinney  i thought it was going to come and devour me  humphreys here i am  zapping  come out come out whereveryou are  aw dont be shy come on  huh  itsjust like i told you  theres nothing out here but a bunch oftrees  that this man values more than human life  im going to see him tried on murder charges  what doyou think  i think im going to suggest  that we sleep with the lights on  sighs  zapping  you see this douglas fir  its been standing here since before time  and your men cut it down  scully who marks these trees  federal forest service  youre only supposed to cut trees  with a blue x  mulder it must be hundreds ofyears old  scully must get a lot oflumber from a tree like this  thousands ofboard feet hell ofa lot easier  than taking a lot ofsmaller younger trees  monkeywrenchers like spinney here  are not above marking trees  with their own paint  this trees 500 years old ifits a day  mulder look at this  what would this represent  i dont know ive never seen a ring like that before  those center rings are older rings right  yeah every ring represents a season ofgrowth  and you see these  these are 500 600 years old  theyre a recorded history ofrainfall and climate  but this one i dont know  i should take a core sample  we finished with this nature walk  what happened to those loggers  were determining that  dontyou think  you should be interrogating this man  i dont think he did it  i want him arrested  hes not leaving  no not with a gun on him  what happens ifhis three buddies show up  and do toyou what they did  to those two federal forest officials  i just want to take a core sample  i got families who want some answers about loved ones  answers not found in that tree  the only crime is the death ofthat tree  yeah well well see about that  whereyou going  im hiking down toyour truck  and get some people up here  who will take action  steve  let him go  let him find out for himself  this is odd  this yellow rings got something living in it  some kind of  tiny bug  it doesnt make sense  why not  well parasites attack a tree in a variety ofways  but they always attack the living parts  the leaves the roots the new growth rings  even iftheyre borers ofsome kind  theywouldnt be working so deep in the tree  maybe the wood in this ring is different  they seem to be feeding on it  can you identify them  its a wood mite ofsome kind  could they have been living in that tree for hundreds ofyears  no inner rings are dead wood  the trees vascular system  is limited to the outer few rings  they need water to survive  they appear to be hatching out ofthe wood  maybe when you drew out this core  you tapped into a larger nest  spinney can they build a cocoon  right after that tree was cut down is when teague died  its about the same time that the loggers disappeared too  you think these mites killed the men  maybe they been dormant for hundreds ofyears  maybe theywoke up hungry  damn it  sighs  humming  all right you monkeywrenchers  come on out now  i know whatyoure up to  humming  horn honks  grunting  screaming  ldling smoothly  humphreys should have been back by now  these bugs arent moving anymore  theyre either dead or theyre asleep  its the light they dont like the light  scully usually bugs are attracted to light  spinney these obviously are notyour ordinary bugs  to say the least  doyou know insects scully  uhjust what i learned in my biology courses  theyre the foundation ofour ecosystem  there are lots ofthem something like   theyve been around a long time  yeah something like  before the dinosaurs why  this tree is what  yeah  these rings represent a history ofclimatic changes  which means that in this year in the life ofthe tree  there was some strange event that produced an abnormal ring  like what exactly  a volcanic eruption  this whole chain ofmountains  running from washington to oregon is active  remember mount st helens  yeah how does that explain the bugs  after mount st helens erupted there was radiation unleashed  from inside the earth  strange things started to grow  theres this lake where they discovered an amoeba  that sucks a mans brains out  oh a brainsucking amoeba  its true spirit lake theres documented cases  ofinfected swimmers  but an amoeba is  a singlecelled organism that can be mutated  an insect is a complex animal  a mutation would takeyears to evolve  maybe what were dealing with isnt a mutation at all  what ifits some kind ofextinct insect larvae  in that ring  deposited during volcanic activity  brought up through the trees root system  ancient insect eggs  thousands maybe millions ofyears old  iying dormant  until those loggers cut down that tree  that would be rather poeticjustice dontyou think  unleashing the very thing that would end up killing them  and your friend humphreys  and who knows  maybe us  sweet dreams  humphreys might havejust hiked out ofhere  we dont know that he didnt  maybe were letting ourselves get carried away  with this bug story  yeah maybe  ldling smoothly  mulder going somewhere  no i was  doing auto repair  youre planning on cutting out  my friends only had enough gas  to keep their generator running 20 hours  theyll die ifl dont get back  why sneak around  the forest service guy wouldnt go for it  hed never trust me  hes got no reason to neither do l  i can save us all weve got ajeep  itsjust two valleys over it needs a battery  i can be back in the morning  we can all drive out tomorrow  you got to trust me man  mulder radios back up  its working  im not getting any reception  so the receiver could be trashed  what about transmissions can you send a message  i could try  this is a call for help  is there anyone at this frequency  this is special agent mulder ofthe fbl  we have an emergency and a possible quarantine  our position is  generator dies  what happened to the generator  i turned it off  turn it back on the radios working  wheres the gas can  spinney took it  he took it  you mean hes gone  he left earlier he took a battery and gas  hes coming back  he gave his personal guarantee  he gave me his word yeah  the man who gaveyou his word has made an art out ofsabotage  and defying authority and is probably the man  who put that bullet through mywindshield  what would you have done  weve got one chance which is one more than we had  or one less  what doyou mean  he let spinney take the last ofthe gas  this generators got about a quarter tank left  what about the trucks  the tanks have been ruptured or filled with sugar  by the man we are trusting to come back for us  we got to get on the radio and send a mayday  every drop offuel  is going to keep this gennie powered tonight  i dont want to wait  hoping somebody heard that transmission  when this thing quits running about 200 in the morning  doyou  sighs  groans  mulder  its done i shouldnt have let him go  letsjust move past it okay  fine  what doyou suggest  i dont know  well think ofsomething  i thinkwe both have a good idea  ofwhat happened to those loggers  and what happened to the group in 1 934  they only found one cocoon  its a big forest  what would you have done  would i have made a decision myself that affected us all  cut the sanctimonious crap  what doyou want me to say  we might die up here  ifwere lucky theyll find our bodies spun up in a tree  or they may not find us at all  youre right and were wasting time arguing about it  what areyou going to do  button this place up  ifwe got to spend the night in here  we got to do everything we can  to make sure the bugs stay out there  id be careful with that  its the only bulb that works  ldling roughly  i can see them  you guys look at this  look theyre coming through the wall  down where its dark  you see them  gasps softly  theyre on me  mulder its all right  scully scully  get them offme  whoa watch it  stand still  stop it  can you see them  get them off  theyre notjust on you  theyre everywhere  thats what that residue is over everything  i thought we were safe in the light  we are  i think the light keeps them from swarming  well be safe as long as we stay in the light  ldling smoothly  howyou feeling  im okay  theyre oxidizing enzymes  just like firefies  maybe thats why they cocoon their prey  so that they can oxidize the proteins  taken from the fuids in the body  what ifthe generator goes  will they swarm in here and drain the life out ofus  we got an hour and a half till sunrise  then what its over a days hike out ofhere  we wont make it on foot by nightfall  maybe somebody heard our transmission  help could be on the way  you sent that call hours ago  i mean help would have been here by now  well im not going to give up on spinney  he gave me his word hed come back to get us  and ifhe doesnt  well think ofsomething  ldling roughly  generator sputtering  sputtering lncreases  generator dies  you got a patch kit in your truck  yeah  maybe we can patch this or get it to hold air  with the trucks spare maybe we can limp down the mountain  ifnot we can get on the radio and warn them whats out here  thunder rumbling  moore see it  mulder yeah  low humming  listen  you hear that  moore its a car  no its ajeep  we got to move lets go lets go  wait  what about the body humphreys body  leave it ive radioed for help  where areyour friends  they didnt make it  we wont either  unless we haul ass  lets go come on  spinney oh  damn it  moore i dont believe it  you talk about shooting yourselfin the foot  yelling  get out ofthere get in the car  yelling  groaning  screaming  we have an emergency evacuation situation  requesting quarantine facility for two  possibly three victims  with undiagnosed infection or exposure  to unknown biological vectors  repeat thats an emergency evacuation situation  two possibly three victims  how areyou feeling  better  how did the tests come back  your respiratory charts were good  we were concerned  about the damage due to inhalation  there were large concentrations  ofthe chemical we determined was luciferin  which is what  the same enzyme we find in firefies  and other bioluminescent insects  our entomologists are still trying to determine  the specific epithet  ofthe insects you encountered  scully  hows she doing  shes still not out of the woods so to speak  she lost a lot offuids  two or three more hours ofexposure  she might not have made it  i told her it was going to be a nice trip to the forest  howyou going to contain it to the forest  what ifthe swarm migrates  the government has initiated eradication procedures  theyre quite certain that by using a combination  ofcontrolled burns and pesticides  theywill be successful  and iftheyre not  that is not an option mr mulder  imade this
