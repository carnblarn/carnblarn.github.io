appetite for human fesh  but this is no animal  you see the teeth marks just below the clavicle  theyre human  who found the body  park ranger  was he alive when it happened  lts hard to tell theres a

contrary  l think lve been exceedingly polite  so whats eating that guy  he was perfectly in his rights  the fbl has no overridingjurisdiction  on a murder case  youd feel the same way  ifsomeone was horning in on yourwork  chances are hes without a clue  hell probably be scratching his head  when they bring the next body in  you could have really humiliated him  and told him who the perpetratorwas  thejersey devil  what doyou saywe grab a hotel take in a foor show  drop a few quarters in the slot  and do a little digging on this case  youre kidding right  we can skip the foor

bureau finds out  they dropped the charges tomson ran me through the system to spite me  lm talking about thisjersey devil  l saw it lts exactly what the ranger described  the way it moved sniffed the air  lts out ofthe woods probably in search offood  lll say  lt picked through the garbage  lfit was a maneater why didnt it come after me  probably felt threatened  youre ascribing it a motive and an alibi  this thing chewed somebodys arm off  lts not exactly a defensive posture  butyou do believe l saw something  you saw something but l wont go in and sell it  when its nothing more than a sighting in a dark alley  lm still paying for a hotel room  l have to get back to washington by 730  another birthday party  no  l have a date  can you cancel  unlikeyou mulder l would like to have a life  l have a life  come on l have somebody l wantyou to meet  on the way home  come on  hold on  just about every culture has one  yeti sasquatch the russian almas  why is that  lts a universal wild man myth  a symbolic fear ofour dual natures as humans  as creators oflife and destroyers ofit  whats this chart  lt shows the historic entry ofman onto each continent  and the effect it had on other animal species  which has been disastrous  why  we humans have retained hereditary traits  through evolution  that have proven to be extremely destructive  we tend to be tribal and aggressively territorial  oriented by selfish sexual and reproductive drives  that make cooperation beyond the family or tribe  extremely hard for us  so we kill other species in order to survive  humans are top carnivores  we sit at the top ofthe food chain  and reduce other species chances ofsurvival  nice to know dana left here with more than a degree  but what ifsomething entered the food chain above us  lt wont happen  our intelligence virtually ensures  that barring the introduction ofsome alien lifeform  we will live out our days as rulers ofthe world  but what if through some fuke ofnature  a human was born  who reverted to its most animal instincts  a kind ofcarnivorous neanderthal  wouldnt he occupy a space above us on the food chain  oh sure  all hed have to do  is wait outside any fastfood restaurant  and eat us on the way in  havent there been cases  where men have been raised in the wilderness by animals  who have no language and hunt like predators  yes but cannibalism is rare  even among lower mammals  but even when faced with extinction  maybe in thejungles of new guinea  ltsjust highly unlikely that whatyoure suggesting  could have survived civilization or evolution  out in the woods of newjersey  highly unlikely  but not outside the realm ofextreme possibility  well it would be an amazing discovery  rob the hard thing  was when mywife remarried  suddenly l felt very competitive for my sons attention  lt was weird  lm sure  l became a superdad on the weekends with scott  l had this unconscious fear ofbeing replaced  l actually had dreams  where l was running over his stepfatherwith my car  youll understand when you have kids  having kids changes everything  thats what they say  maybe some weekend ifyoure up for it  we could take the kids out to the beach for the day  yeah  great  thankyou  can l ask about the case youre on or cantyou say  well  l dont think its a case we should discuss over dinner  l dont suppose youd want to hear  about the finer points ofestate planning and taxation   telephone ringing   mulder  agentmulder this is peterbrouillet  ofthejersey parks department  oh yeah hi  l found a body out in the woods today  itlooks

thought  maybe it isnt a beast man were looking for after all  well ifthey picked it up  nobody logged the body on the chart  l sure havent seen it  what else would they have done with it  we called you here for nothing  theyre going to sweep this under the carpet  why  any publicity and the streets will be crawling  with people who arent here to play craps  word gets out theres something on the loose forget it  lts a female  the body they found was a male  theres a 5050 chance there was a mate  we may never know unless we find out ourselves  lfits true what are the chances ofcapturing it alive  lfit is a primate  it would have a natural fear ofheights  lt would also want to stay close to its food source  this thing has no fear ofheights  well start with the lower foors  how much time will that dart give us  lt will put down a 500pound bear for an hour  ifl hit it  what the hells a park rangervehicle doing here  l dont know  check it out  run a check for me on  something here  lts blood  she could be bringing her killing here  she could be injured  roger zebra team in position  what ifit is a female scully  how close is she toyou or me  does she feel emotion  or are her daysjust spent looking for food  maybe she spends her day shopping  eight million years out ofafrica  l dont think were all that different  mulder weve put men into space  weve built computers  that work faster than the human mind  while we overpopulate the world  and create new technologies to kill each otherwith  maybe werejust beasts with big brains  what  no l wasjust  thinking about my godsons birthday party  eight little sixyearold boys running around  talk about primitive behavior  tomson hisnameis mulder  hesa federalagent  you know him  no  whatareyoudoinghere  im aprofessor

man looks like she tried to bury herself  why did you have to kill her  same reason you kill a rabid animal   sighing   hi  thisjust came through  lts a posthumous medical exam ofthe womans body  they found fragments ofhuman bone  still in her digestive tract  they estimated her age to be 25 to 30 years  they allowed dr diamond to do a medical exam ofthe body  but he found nothing  that suggested prehistoric bone structure  or physiology  the acpd has her listed as ajane doe  in a search for her identity  and state psychiatric records has begun in earnest  good luck  they have also released the medical exam  from the male body that they found  his age is estimated to be about 40 years  there would have been offspring  the medical exam ofthe womans uterus  seems to indicate that she may have given birth  she was protecting her children lt all makes sense  the male dies  and she comes out ofthe woods in search offood  do me a favor  go out and have a beer take the day off  lll cover
