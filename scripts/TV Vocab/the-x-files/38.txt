this stump here is supposedto be the ceremonial altar what do you think with turquoise chips a picture ofjohn wayne and three cans of shellac itd make a pretty nice coffee table you see all that waxsomeones been burning candles in there  any idea who jerry stevens was with we assume he was alone most people dont set out to drinktwo sixpacks by themselves i also found this it has purple ink on the edgelike a library identification stamp the end of the title says in americaim surprised you people overlooked it im sorry i i gotta apologise hereyoure right i admit were a little rattled herethats why i called the fbi this may involve a deeper conspiracy see i grew up around hereever since i was a kid i heard stories this is a weird area it has a strange airthat i could chalk up to imagination till today ill have my staff start checkinglibraries for you agent scully better hide your megadeth albums theories like that are whyi cant take him seriously the homicide had a ceremonial presentationthe manner in which the body was displayed i got the impression you didnt believe him i didnt want to incitehis aggravated imagination but there is a weird feel to this placemaybe theres truth in the rumours i think he incited your imagination i think its nothing more than a murderertaking advantage of local folklore theres nothing odd about so  lunch mulder toads just fell from the sky i guess their parachutes didnt open you were saying somethingabout this place not feeling odd crowley high school library the weather service says there aretornadoes in massachusetts the wind

like that what made you go to a placeyou heard was a witches altar we were just trying to get some i told you why did you take the book i dont know a thing about witchcraft and wewanted it to sound good i never thought you never thought what that it would work if you didnt kill jerry stevenswhy did you run away from us im scared man  of us of it that ceremony im afraid we called upsome devil or something one of you killed jerry stevens who he was displayed accordingto the rites of azazel who else would know about the ritual  we stopped doing this because i went out there we were supposed to have a massno one else showed so i left  it wasnt any of us something is here a presence amongst us angryi can feel it  youre letting them go theres no evidence to warrant an arrest  they never leave evidence we heard how jerry died an occult ritual  theyve reached into our area from outside they again those three kids are obviouslyunder a cult influence they reach into our childrenin music television books they prey on childrens innocence the fbi did a sevenyear study and found no evidence ofthe existence of occult conspiracies and j edgar hoover never admittedto the existence of the mafia if the murders attributed tooccult conspiracies were true it would mean thousands of peoplekilling tens of thousands without evidence without being exposed it would be the greatest criminal conspiracyin the history of civilisation finally you people understandwhat were up against our investigation is ongoing mulder this is mass hysteria and our presence here gives validityto their fears of occult murders  the water whats wrong with it its going down the drain counterclockwise coriolis force in the northern hemispheredictates it should go down clockwise  that isnt possible something is here scully something is making these things possible girls may i have a word i heard on the grapevineabout what happened i know how hard it is to talk to adultseven though you feel like you want

herewhen i was about um four she was about two anyway a couple of weeks ago my class we took a field trip to whatthey call the american stonehenge and i remember when i was four years old jim took me in his car near there and he um he made me in the back seat he told me that if i ever toldanybody he would hurt me as he touched me you know i wouldpretend like i was out of my body deep in the ocean down with the fish in the dark water somehow i managed toblock out all these things but lately its all been im remembering you know the others too others yeah men and women they would um come to the houseyou know when my mom was away and they would take medown to the basement it was really dark it was likepainted red with a dirt floor they would wear these robes black and red and they would sing and they would chant and then they would tie me and my sister up these men and womenthey would make us do things they called me a breeder they would get me pregnant andthen they would kill the babies ive had three children andtheyre all buried in the cellar one night jim murdered my sister for a sacrifice she was only eight years old he told everybody thatshed died in an accident today brought it all back clear like it happened yesterday imagine if what she said is true why dont we just wait and seewhat her parents have to say wheres shannon they told meyou were bringing her home she wanted to remain with friendsunder the circumstances we thought it best circumstances why wouldntshe want to come home someone or something has obviouslyput these things into her mind mrs ausbury perhapsyoud like a glass of water yeah thank you mr ausbury mrs ausbury your daughter has not accusedyou of any involvement in these activities do you have any idea why shannonmight have said these things jim and i have been havingmarriage problems lately were committed to working them out maybewe dont pay enough attention to shannon she and i dont we dont get along we fight have you ever known shannonto be pregnant of course not shes fifteen years old  how can you possibly believe have you ever had another child a girl theresa she died at eight years old eight weeks with crib death did you do it i would kill anyone who didthe things to her that she claims not a very christian tenet thou god of vengeance shine forth even the devil can quotescripture to fit his needs how dare you get out of our house as far as i know you put thoseideas in my daughters head now get out the devil travels in many forms and you may be one are you sure youre up to this shannoni heard about what you said ill be ok i dont wanna miss the final ill be in my office if youre feeling funny you ought to remove your jewellery youwouldnt want to lose it in some pigs guts ill hold it until youre finished i heard the chair and a crash andi came running out of the office did you see anybody leaving the room did you hear the door open i lock the doors after schoolwhen im alone i i get afraid i feel a dark angel is amongst us it wants a sacrifice its been years sincesince weve done that exactly exactly we havent kept our faith are any of youresponsible for my daughter we all are she was sacrificed for us its a portent shannons death allowsus to get rid of the police the fbi it can all be blamed on her jim you tell them she hada thing for jerry stevens she killed him out of jealousy she cut out his eyes because she couldntstand to have him look at another girl and his heart because she was heartbroken but when they leave and are gone we mustrekindle our faith rather than lose it i never imagined she would hurt herselfim oldfashioned agent scully i cant believe that children are capableof such things as they are these days she wanted me to hold that for her excuse me her office has a faint odour of incense  she says it stops the smell of formaldehyde its also used in black mass rituals i must admit there are someoddities to her story what do you mean oddities the man she replaced has takentwo sick days in a 15year career the morning of jerry stevens murdermr kingery developed necrotising fasciitis  flesheating bacteria thats very rare i know and when i questioned the staff about mrspaddock no one can even recall hiring her oh look im even getting caught up in this im sure mrs paddocks arrival and theteachers sickness is just a coincidence the fact that no one recallshiring her is an oversight this is somethingwe should get caught up in ill search the ausbury houseive been told theyre staying with friends you check mrs paddock powers out my religion my family agent mulder goes back in this town seven generations they fled persecution frompeople being persecuted all in the name of religion i was raised to believe christianitywas synonymous with hypocrisy mans natural tendency was to do whatthou willst not do unto others we believe man is nothing but an animal no better no worse than thosethat walk on four legs and although i believed our faithkept us powerful in the community  wealthy good health  i came to see hypocrisy in the others in me when they told me to blame my dead daughterfor jerry stevens death my reaction i was sick that they wouldvilify an innocent someone i loved just to protect themselves and at that moment i knewi am better than an animal that my previous beliefs were responsible for herno longer being with us and that it was time to talk to you clean  did you abuse shannon never sexually and the rituals the blood of the young isconsidered very powerful wed include them in the ceremoniesagainst their will they were too young to be trusted not to talkbut we never physically hurt them wed slip over the ancient ritualsthat we didnt want to do like drinking grape juiceinstead of wine at communion what about shannons memories wed perform a sort of posthypnoticsuggestion that repressed their memories when they came of age  18 21 then they were made aware of the religionand brought into its practice when she recalled the past eventsshe mustve mixed up reality with with that crap thats on geraldoand the tabloids did the others kill jerry stevens shannon no but you are responsible you knew the possibilities contained inyour beliefs no matter how watered down did you really think you could call upthe devil and ask him to behave who are the others  yeah mulder the school im in trouble scully weve got an emergencyim placing you under arrest ill be back for you later agh  scully mulder whats wrong  you called you said you were in trouble no i didnt touch the phone ausbury confessed to conspiracy hell nameeverybody involved parents teachers i checked on mrs paddocks backgroundi dont think shes involved my god do you think its some kind of acid theres no evidence of any reactionwith the wood from the acid there are tracks in the dirtlike from a snake thats impossible it would take a large python hours toconsume and weeks to digest a human being you really do watch the learning channel scully snakeskin theres a python in paddocks room sheriff oakes called me jim ausbury is dead he was talking to the fbi did they kill him you know who killed him ausbury was no believer he had no real faith no devotionhe was punished
