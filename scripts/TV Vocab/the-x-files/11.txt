                woman whats she doing there by herself  man teena  honey  youre freezing  wheres yourjacket  wheres your daddy  in theyard  he told me he needed some time to himself  id say his times up  come on honey  im sure he wouldnt wantyou to catch cold  joel  heyjoel  the swing sets supposed to be foryour daughter not foryou   screams   ill call 91 1   daddy  death by hypovolemia   thats over four liters ofblood  you could say the man was running on empty  the mans daughter eightyears old  was away from his side no more than ten minutes  she doesnt remember anything  no trace evidence at the scene  any evidence would have been washed away byyesterdays rain  there were two small puncture wounds  in thejugular  areyou at all familiar  with the phenomenon ofcattle mutilations  hmm  since 1 967 over 34 states  have reported unsolved cases ofcattle mutilations   projectorhumming   the trace evidence is remarkably similar  incision marks ofsurgical precision  the area around the mouth and often the sexual organs  has been removed  theres a substantial degree ofblood loss  without a trace ofblood  how can that be  exsanguination  ifyou stick a needle in thejugular  ofany living creature  the heart itselfacts as a pump  these animals had theirjugulars punctured  the same as that man only this is the first time  ive seen it on a human being  but there was no struggle  how can a manjust sit through a bloodletting  the me found traces ofdigitalis  a south american plant that can be used as a paralytic drug  these x files indicate this is a uforelated phenomena  often there are sightings  in the sky near the incident surface burns  witnesses often report time loss  weve seen this in abduction cases  that might explain why she cant remember anything  mulder whywould alien beings travel lightyears to earth  in order to play doctor on cattle  for the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys  besides  they seem to have stepped up their interest  her mother passed away from ovarian cancer twoyears ago  theres no other family  well keep teena here until we can place herwith a foster family  has she spoken about it  no not a word  any nightmares  no at least not that i know of  can we talk to her now  yes  teena  these are the people we talked about  this is miss scully and mr mulder  doyou think you can talk to them  okay  hi  i knowyou must be feeling  very sad right now  and scared  but we want to find out what happened  so we can help stop  whoever hurt your daddy okay  did you ever see any strangers  with your daddy at home  did you ever see anyone yell atyour daddy  oryour daddyyell at them  no  can you think ofanyone who might want  to hurtyour daddy  no  thats a nice bunny teena  can we talk about what happened that day  about what happened in the backyard  you remember any strange sounds or lights  or anything like that  there was red lightning  can you tell me more  about the red lightning  i cant remember  it all went dark  haveyou ever seen anything like that before  you have  when  the men from the clouds  theywere after my dad   telephonerings   scully  whywere these men afteryour dad  theywanted to exsanguinate him  mulder  what  theres been another one  its like looking at a mirror image  the victim reardon was married with one daughter  cause ofdeath hypovolemia  mulder this is uncanny  they also found traces ofthe poison digitalis  puncture wound  uh yes  on thejugular  the time ofdeath was estimated at 230 pm  same day only three hours earlier  than the simmons murder  thats pacific standard time  that makes it the exact same moment  it appears as ifwe have two serial killers  working in tandem  no serial killers rarelywork in pairs  and when they do  they kill together not separately  mulder nothing beyond  your leading questions to teena simmons  substantiates a ufo mutilation theory  was reardons daughter here when he was murdered  uh yes  the police report states that she remembers nothing  shes with her mother and family in sacramento  when will they be back  tomorrow  even money shell remember red lightning   footsteps approaching    screaming   teena  teena  teena  teena  she was kidnapped from the social services home  around 1 1 00 pm iast night  looks like someone was afraid  she might remember too much  someone or something scully  connecticut state troopers  set up roadblocks within a halfan hour  nothing  maybe theywerent looking in the right direction  i told them to contact us in case they find her  teena  no  whats your name  cindy reardon  doyou live here cindy  ever since i was born eightyears ago  help   whimpers   yelling   whew  this is the ceremonial signing ofthe bill  which is now known as  and forever forward from this point on known as  cindy really is  a beautiful little girl mrs reardon  doug and i wanted to spoil her  we wanted to protect her  from everything horrible in the world  she was daddys little girl  is she an only child  may i ask was cindy adopted  no  i gave birth to her at san rafael general  so i assumeyou have  all the proper documentation  birth certificate  ofcourse i do  was she the only child delivered at that birth  what the hell kind ofquestion is that  look i have told the police  everything i know  mrs reardon haveyou ever seen this man before  is this your suspect  no  did he do something to cindy  no he  no mrs reardon  this is notyour daughter  that girls name is teena simmons  she lives in greenwich connecticut  that man her father  was killed in the same manner as your husband  cindy is my daughter  i can showyou videos ofher birth  we tried for sixyears to become pregnant  in vitro fertilization  at which clinic  the luther stapes center down in san francisco  mulder thanks  scully doyoustillbelieve this is uf orelated  cindy reardon didnt see red lightning  the only thing similar about these girls  does seem to be their appearance  there is the random possibility  that two people can have an unrelated likeness  who bothjust happen to see their fathers exsanguinated  id like to get the odds on that in vegas  the girls are the one and only link  between identical murders  and one girl wasjust abducted  kidnapped   potato potahto   where areyou going  ifthe murders were committed by the same person  part ofthe pattern involves kidnapping the daughter  youd expect the pattern to continue  im going to watch the girl  you check out the clinic  see ifthe simmons were enrolled  ill call the san francisco bureau  and get someone  to relieveyou  okay  dr katz during vitro fertilization  we canimplementfertilization andimplantation  ofthe embryo in the uterus  could a patient believe she was receiving her own egg  but actually receive another without her knowledge  not here  we have very strict controls  areyou aware ofever having patients  named claudia andjoel simmons  thats confidential its our policy  both the simmons are dead  and their daughter has been kidnapped  id say any information you have that could help  would overrideyour policy  you had copies oftheir records transferred  to greenwich connecticut in 1 991   they came here nineyears ago  under the supervision ofa dr sally kendrick  is there a problem  dr kendrickwas nothing but a problem  hello and welcome  to the luther stapes center for reproductive medicine  im dr sally kendrick  a specialist in the exciting field  ofin vitro fertilization  she was a resident here in 1 985  brilliant  first in her class at yale med where she got her md  after completing her doctorate in biogenetics  oh we were thrilled to get her  and nowyou dont sound so thrilled  we have reason to believe that dr kendrick  was tampering with genetic material  offertilized ova in the lab prior to implant  experimenting with eugenics  did you report this to the ama  ofcourse  i fired her  and requested an investigation from the health department  and what happened  the ama censured her  my request for an investigation was denied  atlutherstapes  dr kendrick disappeared  weknowthepain ofinfertility andweare readytohelp  in the next halfhour  ill guideyou through our lvf program  scully kendrick supervised the reardons  and simmons lvf program  it seems she experimented at the clinic  mulder and maybe now shes trying to erase the results  i wish that we could guarantee everyone success  but with our scientific advances  a little luck and a lot ofhope  miracles can happen  well she must have had an accomplice  in order to have done both murders  soyou think this is a vendetta that she and a colleague have  against the stapes center  haveyou abandoned your ufo connection   phonerings   hello  hello  just a couple clicks  must be the wrong number  ill tell you what  im going to sleep on it  and well talk about it in the morning  mulder youre rushing me out ofthe room  no im not  doyou have a girl  coming over  whats a girl  i got a movie to watch on tv  sleep tight  seeyou in the morning  areyou certain she hasnt followed you  what areyou doing here  well i thought we might take in a warriors game  no actually i was just in the neighborhood  and uh  wondered if i had ever told you  about the litchfield experiments  hmm no you havent  well it was a most  interesting project  highest level ofclassification  all records have since been destroyed  and those who knew ofit  will deny knowledge ofits existence  in the early 50s  during the height ofthe cold war  we got wind that the russians  were fooling around with eugenics  rather primitively i might add  trying to crossbreed  their top scientists athletes  you name it  to come up with the superior soldier  naturally wejumped  on thebandwagon  mulder the litchfieldexperiment  deep throat a group of geneticallycontrolledchildren  who were raisedandmonitored ona compoundin litchfield  theboys were called adam  andthegirls were called eve   theresa woman  youshouldsee  andlllmakesure

you work  for the luther stapes center for reproductive medicine in 1 985  in 1 985 i had been tied up like this for twoyears  and forwhat reason  no reason i did nothing  im just me  they made me  but did they suffer  no no i suffer  i suffer  they keep me alive  for the litchfield project  they come in and they test me  they poke me to see what went wrong  sally knows what went wrong  you and you  you have 46 chromosomes  the adams me the eves we have 56  we have extra chromosomes  number four five  this replication ofchromosomes also produces additional genes  heightened strength heightened intelligence  heightened psychosis  saved the best for last  you dont believe me  i have proof  look on mywall  my family album  scully my god its the girls  eve 6 we were close  we were very close  sally kendrick was using the clinic  to carry on the litchfield experiment  she was cloning herself  cindy  now i lay me down to sleep  i pray the lord my soul to keep  ifl should die before i wake  i pray the lord my soul to take  god bless grandma and grampa stenner  irma and lrmapop  and god bless mom  and please take care of daddy up in heaven  youre such a special little girl cindy  good night honey  if eve 6 is right  then there are two other eves out there  that could account for the two identical murders  occurring at exactly the same time  sally kendrick does have an accomplice herself  until i heard that i suspected the girls  no no it seems the two remaining eves  are doing awaywith the parents  in order to keep teena and cindy in the family  scully doyou suppose the girls have any idea ofwhat they are  i hope not  mulder lets go  ill take the back   knocking   theres someone upstairs  wait outside  fbi  im armed  which one areyou  eve 7 or eve 8  drop it  you know im capable  slow very slow  the suspects name is sally kendrick  early 40s 5 8  now she may have an accomplice  similar in appearance  kendrick is driving a light blue 93 corolla  she has exceptional strength for her size  soyou must consider her armed and dangerous  quite possibly shell display severe psychotic behavior  the oakland bureau is here to orchestrate the search  across the bridge  what if  what ifshe kills her  first doug now cindy  the fact that kendrick and her accomplice  murdered the fathers and abducted the girls  tells us that they want them alive  im sure cindys alive and well find her  and then what do we do  im sorryyou have to meet this way  but its the best for all concerned  teena simmons meet cindy reardon  agent scully they found the light blue corolla  in the parking lot  ofsan francisco lnternational  start a check on every single passenger list  for every fight that left the terminal  within the past 1 2 hours  check every terminal and make sure  shes not hiding out for a later fight  remember she may have an accomplice  a motel manager in pt reyes  has a guest matching sally kendricks description  we found the car at the airport  she might have ditched it  the manager said this woman checked in with a little girl  that she leaves in the afternoon by herself is gone all night  and returns with the girl  the area is a place  full ofvacationing families with kids  this kid said to use chlorine  to eradicate the dinofagellates in the swimming pool  sound like someoneyou know  thats it  ive always kept a close eye on your behavior  no matterwhere i was  the last fewyears  i spent in search ofthe remaining eve  that however was cut short byyour activity  id hoped mywork at the stapes center  had corrected the litchfield faws  psychotic behavior  didnt develop in the adams and eves  until age 1 6 homicidal behavior at 20  imagine my disappointment  when i learned ofyour accelerated development  how did you learn ofeach others existence  wejust knew  did you discuss howyou would orchestrate  your little prank  wejust knew  why murderyour fathers  they werent our fathers  we have no parents  we werent born  we were created  you you cannot think that way  youre human beings  different special  butyou cannot give in to genetic destiny  thats why ive taken you  i was raised by a man who knew what i was  he was a genetic engineer on the project  with the proper environment  and a program oflongterm medication  you can become like me  and not the other eves   rattling   whwhat what haveyou done  your soda  four ounces offoxglove  extracted  from a digitalis plant  this much is a lethal dose  we cultivated them ourselves  whwhy  you tell us  you made us  cindy wereyour mistake  illl  correct that mistake

they  she and another lady  what did the other lady look like  eve 8  theywere working together  its all right  well take care ofyou  youre safe with us  it looks like the eves mixed  about four ounces ofdigitalis  in each glass  their own minijonestown  eve 6 said theywere prone to suicide  it has a sweet favor  its probably not even perceptible in soda  so far theres no sign ofthe other suspect  well have an officer take the girls back  no maybe it would be best  if we take responsibility for the girls  we can get them checked out by a doctor  okay whatever  okay  come on girls  were
