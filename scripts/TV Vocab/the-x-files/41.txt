unbelievable  you dont believe me after 22 years why come back  ive explained youve explained only what you had to i know next to nothing about your socalledparents or the man who wants to kill them the men youve been seekingare the progeny of two original visitors clones who have been attempting toestablish a colony here since the late 1940s  a colony loosely the community by necessity is dispersed clones identical to my parents livein virtually every part of the country what are they trying to accomplish its their belief that our stewardshipof the planet is being forsaken and that by defaulttheyll become the natural heirs and in the meantime through hybridisation theyve been erasingthat aspect which has forced them to scatter their identical natures all the clones workedin abortion clinics why access to foetal tissuethough the biologies are incompatible they finally found a wayto combine human dna with alien dna and this manwhy has he been sent to kill them the experiments werent sanctioned it was considered a dilution oftheir species a pollution of their race so a bounty hunter was dispatchedto destroy them and terminate the colony thats a good storybut ive

must help us you have no choice no i i do have a choice my choice is to walk outta here we know where your sister is ask yourself agent mulder how elsewould we know so much about her hes here i found one sir were gonna get you outta here  what about the others we got real lucky there are no others no wait there were women in here  we looked youre the only one no keep looking after treatment for smoke inhalation agent mulder was released fromsamaritan hospital in satisfactory condition at his request the abortion clinic wherehe was found has been searched repeatedly but the bodies of the womenhe insists perished were not found my report on this case remains incomplete many aspects continue to defy explanation including the identitiesof the identical men and women agent mulders claim of alien originscannot be substantiated the suspect in their disappearancesis still at large he has now been charged with the deathof fbi special agent barrett weiss whose body is quarantined at the medicalresearch institute of infectious diseases his cause of death involveda thickening of the blood we now believe he was subjectedto a virulent strain of virus whose origin and behaviourare also unexplainable it is my hope that further analysis of thiscontagion will aid in the solution of this case  this is a retrovirus yes but weve never seen anything like it do you recognise it was the thickening of the bloodan immunological response to the virus apparently exposure to it triggersa massive production of red blood cells take a look at this we took a second cultureand were able to control its growth what did you do all we did was lowerthe temperature by 5 fahrenheit  so the virus is inhibited by cold knocked out by it for some reason this retrovirusgoes dormant at cold temperatures we pulled a body from the riverthat was chilled near freezing  when it started to thaw it began to corrode corrode if you find out anything elseyou let me know as soon as possible you wanted to see me  how was the opera ive never slept better i dont like these hastypublic meetings agent mulder  im sorry i need your help its over the fat lady is singing i need to know what you know  ok theyre all dead no one of them is alive the onewho was sent to kill them where is he a nuclear submarine located his craftin the beaufort sea five days ago they were ordered to destroy itbut were

hard do you wanna make this no harder than it has to be ive killed men for far less you pull that triggeryoull be killing two men now i wanna know where mulder is agent mulder flew to tacoma washington from there he caught a military planeto deadhorse alaska he used his fbi credentialsto charter an allterrain vehicle its still a tenmile hike across the ice these are the coordinatesof his final destination  how did you get this unofficial channels hey stop  who are you lieutenant terry wilmer step outta there come out what happened to you i dont know we uh we just lost power we we drifted under the ice for days then um then we hit a uh dont look at me face forward we hit a shallow patchand punched through ok thats what happened so why did you run a man came he um he sealed most of the men below deckswithout any air and uh and then he started to execute the rest of us every theyre all dead i uh i thought you were himi didnt know if you were him how is it you managed to survive i hid under the body of the chief petty officer ok i um i played dead whats this for  what are you crazy no im just tired youre not getting back to your shipuntil i get the truth tell me where my sister is  i dont know what youre talkin about base of the neck tell me how i can find her and ill let youget back to your ship before its destroyed please please youre makinga really big mistake if i wanted to i could havekilled you many times before where is she is the answer to your question worthdying for is that what you want where is she just tell me where she is shes alive can you die now agh no change in bp or pulse im dana scully his partnerwhat are his vitals  hes suffering from extreme hypothermia no get him out of the tub  hes lost all his body heat if you keep him in there youll kill him the cold is all thats keeping him alive his heart stopped  give me one amp of epinephrine you dont know what youre dealing with he has been exposed to a retrovirusresulting in hyperviscosity syndrome  i want you out of my er right now nurse yes maam his blood has thickenedthats why his heart is failing his heart is failingbecause hes lost all his body heat no the only thing saving him right now isthe hypometabolic state induced by the cold now if you dont do what im sayingyou are going to kill him lets get him out of that tub now charged and ready  clear clear  no rhythm no  clear clear  im picking up a faint pulse yes i want a digoxin 01mg iv hang a heparin drip of 1000 units per hourand get two units of fresh frozen plasma now  this patients not even hes going to make it transfusions and an aggressive treatmentwith antiviral agents have resulted in a steady but gradualimprovement in agent mulders condition blood tests have confirmed his exposureto the still unidentified retrovirus whose origin remains a mystery the search team that found agent mulderlocated neither the submarine nor the man he was looking for several aspects of this caseremain unexplained suggesting the possibilityof paranormal phenomena but i am convinced thatto accept such conclusions is to abandon all hope of understandingthe scientific events behind them many of the things ive seen have challengedmy faith and my belief in an ordered universe but this uncertainty has onlystrengthened my need to know to understand to apply reasonto those things which seem to defy it it was science that isolated the retrovirusagent mulder was exposed to and science that allowed us tounderstand its behaviour and ultimately it was sciencethat saved agent mulders life hey how you feelin like i got a bad case of freezer burn how did i get here a naval reconnaissance squad found you they choppered you to eisenhower field  thanks for ditching me i am sorry i couldnt let you risk your life on this did you find what you were looking for no no but i found something i thought id lost faith to keep looking i made this
