artifact of hispast present or immigration status have yet to be found his finger prints are noton file in either the fbior national system of records at this timeit remains doubtful that anyone will come forwardto id or claim the body under further analysis the inoculantfound in the broken vials was isolated and determinedto be an unstable antibody of no known biological origin after three weeks of studythe components of the serumprobably synthetic have broken down structurallyand in this retrograde statecan not be analyzed further this coincideswith the development of a severe and undiagnosedflulike ailment affecting the children who werebelieved to have been inoculated and some of the local families to date none of the congregantsor members of the churchof the red museum have contracted this illness i suspect whoever was doing this mayhave been using them as a control group the shipping manifestsfor what is believed to be milk and beef taintedby the unspecified inoculant did not provide enough informationto track their destinations a local advisory and quarantinehave been established further inquiry intothe tainted beef has been promised by the pertinent governmenthealth agencies the fbi investigation into thiscase is currently at a standstill
