                salsatype music ok ok ok  qu pasa aqu santa mara  what the hell is that i dont know hey get out of the way hey move rays hurt bad man hurry up get an ambulance this is wesley brewer out on route seven looks like about an eight oclock etaon that trailer pickup  this fogs gonna slow me down 104 wesley see you when you get here mother of god mom is it gonna die she was just lying therewhen we found her officer so you saw nothing when the window broke  no nothing we heard a noise like thunder then glass everywhere ok thank you  whatd the janitors say they claim they didnt see anything the security monitors dont havea recording of anything either just a giant implosion of glasslike some kind of giant shock wave what they describedsounds more like a sonic boom well no sonic boom did this the construction worker who was killedhad his spine crushed like a string of shells a circular abrasion on his torso inroughly the shape of an elephants foot other workers said they felt the groundshake then a faint whiff of animal odour if you still think the elephant did thisit defies logic somebody would have seen it well if somebody would have seen itscully we wouldnt be here another vehicle would have left evidence  distress to the metal or painti can see signs of neither id admit the possibility of a tornadobut its not really tornado season id even entertain the notionof a black hole passing over the area or some cosmic anomaly but itsnot really blackhole season either if i was a betting manid say that it was um an invisible elephant i saw david copperfield makethe statue of liberty disappear  agent mulder yeah ed meecham fairfield zoosorry for the holdup we had trouble transporting ganeshas body  this is agent scully hi  have they determined what he died of she she was a 12yearold indian female i figure she ran herself into exhaustion  how did she escape well now theres a puzzle when i got the call i expected to find hercage open but it was locked just like i left it  any idea how she could have escaped no sir no signs of tampering either ive read about something calledthe elephant rebellion in zoos elephants turning on their keepersdestroying their pens  was ganesha ever a problem like that elephants are very big very wilful animals so youre saying there were problems the person you wanna talk toabout that is willa ambrose  ambrose shes a naturalist she was hired by the board of supervisorslast year to oversee things shes supposed to be the reigning authority in your opinion the damage here could thishave been caused by an escaped elephant my honest opinion sure excuse me  what you looking for mulder a local paper i wanna see if david copperfields in town excuse me were looking for willa ambrose  there thank you  miss ambrose yes im agent dana scully this is agent mulderwere with the fbi  how can i help you a federal employee has been fatally injured there is a case aroundthe elephant that escaped from your zoo i understood that the eyewitnesses saidthey didnt know how the man was killed what were trying to determineis how ganesha escaped  what did ed tell you he found the cage locked as hed left it  what more can i say a man was found trampled to death an animal from your zoowas found 43 miles away no ones looking to place any blamewere just trying to understand the facts this is where ganesha was heldwhen she wasnt in her habitat  who has keys to this lock only myself and mr meecham otherwise this is a restricted area elephants arent good jumpersif thats what youre thinking no i was wondering why sucha small pen for such a large animal the zoo was built in the 1940sthe pens and habitats are all too confining i was brought on to expandand create more humane environments unfortunately these things take time  those uh chains on the ground there those are tiedowns they restrict the animals movementi disallowed their use when i came here  disallowed their use by whom it was ed meechams practice it reflected an oldnonprogressive zoo policy  hows your relationship with ed meecham im his boss and a woman ed doesnt like it would he be vindictive enoughto let ganesha go as sabotage if he did that would be foolish the facility isrunning at a deficit and may lose its funding  have you discussed the incident with ed no i think eds got enoughdealing with the wao  the wao its the wild again organisation they believe any captive animalis a crime against nature theyre gonna have a field day with this one excuse me the wao believes only tragedy resultsfrom keeping animals in captivity in the wild an elephant would roaman area of 20 square miles minimum ganesha weighed over 5000 pounds andshe was being held in a 50 by 50foot cage  you consider that inhumane its like you or i living in a pickle barrel fbi files state youve been arrestedover a dozen times for the kidnapping of circus and zoo animals the wao sees it as liberation hm were you involvedin the liberation of ganesha that would make me an accessoryto murder wouldnt it endangering these animalsis against everything we believe these are incredibly spiritual creatures their rituals and behaviour are linkedto a past no man ever witnessed did you know they actually bury their dead they can visitan elephant graveyard centuries old and know instinctivelywhere their ancestors bones lie what do you thinkganesha was running from you wanna see ill show you get up halt i got him this is how ed meechamtreats these majestic animals  this is still going on meechams a barbarian hes been torturing animalsat the fairfield zoo for years we figure hes still at iteventually were gonna get some proof were here to put pressure on the zoowere keeping track of what goes on willa ambrose claims shes put a stopto most of his old practices whatever her intentions shes toopreoccupied to know how meecham operates preoccupied with what a lawsuit shes fighting against the malawigovernment over a gorilla named sophie willa rescued her from an african customshouse ten years ago raised her like a child  the malawi government wants her back will they win this is a perfect example of mansimperialism over the animal kingdom some craven impulse to turn animalsinto objects for our own selfish pleasure  i thought you said she rescued this gorilla so she could spend her life behind bars her obligation should have been to return thegorilla to the wild animals should run free  even if it means trampling a man to death maybe he should have moved im sure he would haveif hed seen it coming thanks for your time sirand well get back to you soon  its all happening at the zoo scully well we found our suspects  you think they busted out ganesha you heard him animals should run free what about the eyewitness accountsthe security tapes the fact that no one saw an elephantuntil it was miles away from the zoo the lights at the construction sitewere mercuryvapour 10000 candlepower they can restrict a mans abilityto adjust to the dark and their security cameras are poor quality a grey elephant may not have registeredan image on tape in the dim light im not buying iti think these guys are all talk these guys are dedicated to exactlythis kind of activity unabashedly  did you check out the nightvision camera no it wouldnt surprise me if they triedto capitalise on their success  by doing what by liberating another animal willa ambrose saidthe zoo was in trouble financially the loss of another big exhibitcould shut them down entirely all right you keep an eye on the wao and where are you going to talk to the animals beam me up scotty did anybody tell youthe camera loves you frohike yeah the arresting officersat the free james brown rally  whats this costing the taxpayers mulder uh about a 150 bucks an hour ouch almost as muchas bill clintons haircuts  wheres langly he has a philosophical issue with having his image transmitted  what are you doing in idaho im in fairfield what do you know about it they got a little zoo there lots of strangelore animals escaping disappearing  any idea why youre near the mountain home air base major ufo hotspot weird fact mulder no animal at fairfield zoohas ever brought a pregnancy to term not a cub or a chick the woman in charge has a gorilla that knowssign language supposedly a thousand words if thats the lovely agent scully let her know ive been working out im buff  mulder mulder its me i was right i just followedthe kid from the wao to the zoo hes just about to make it over the fence all right ill be right there scully what the hell are you doing here theres a member ofthe wao on the premises come with me whats going on ok sophie calm down i dont know what youre talking about you have no ideawhat he was doing at the zoo if youre asking if i hadany idea of his intentions the answer is simple not the slightest i saw this camera sitting up thereon the shelf yesterday guess i never noticed it before a tiger is missingand a member of your organisation is dead for such a principled manyou show an amazing lack of emotion if the tiger killed this personthen it was a natural act if i find evidence that he was releasingthose animals under your orders youll spend the restof your life behind bars scully that guy really pisses me off  are you ok scully yeah have you calmed down  have they found the tiger yet no but i took a look at the cassette  he wasnt killed by the tiger what unless its trick photographyit was some kind of phantom attacker you saw his body he was mauled to deathhe had claw marks on his chest and back i cant explain it eitherbut i know someone who might be able to excuse me miss ambrose can we have a word with you i dont know anything more thanive told the police i have nothing to say is this where you keep sophie  sophie is ill do you think we could meet her were not hereto try to take her away from you six weeks ago i had to takesophie out of her public habitat shed become so withdrawn and depressed shed curl into a ball in the cornerof her cage and just shiver  did you ask her why all the time  what did she say light afraid  literally shes afraid of the light she speaks to you over 600 words using american signlanguage she understands over a thousand ill show you her vocabulary list  is this who you wanted to speak to its basic investigative procedure  interview all the possible witnesses gorillas are highly sensitive creatures and sophies use of language skillsmakes her even more so  why would she be afraid of the light youve heard about the malawi government sophie could be taken away from meand i think that she knows that  are these sophies yes what do you think they mean until recentlysophie desperately wanted a baby the brown object in the centreis her expression of that  have you tried to mate her we were looking for a partner but under these stressful conditionsi didnt wanna put her through it  do you have a veterinary facility here yeah this is a strange request but it mighthelp to explain whats been going on im gonna need your help on this too scully  i hope you know what youre getting us into im pretty sure of what were gonna find this isnt exactly in my job description next thing you knowtheyll be doing it on mtv sports ok the elephants cavity is clear im ready for you  the knifes right down there ok i was told theres never been a successfulpregnancy at the fairfield zoo  youve been talking to kyle lang well is it true yes but i dont thinkfor the reasons kyle claims not because ed meechamhas done anything to the animals  why then bringing a pregnancy to term in captivity is always difficult but a perfect failure rate i know its one of the things i wasdetermined to change when i came here was an attempt ever made to mate ganesha no mating an elephantout of the wild is rarely successful there have only been six elephantsborn in captivity over the last ten years heres the uterine tissue but im stillnot clear on what you expect to find youre right mulder the signs inthe uterus and the ovaries are unmistakable so what did you find this animal had been pregnant  what are you talking about theres hypoplasia and the corpus luteum is ruptured  thats not possible neither is an invisible elephant  what is going on here whatever it is its been going on a while i think youll find evidenceof the same thing when your tiger returns i still cant believeyou bet on the chargers  you hear that hear what  wheres the tiger inside the site two men are trapped put the gun away ed do you wanna be responsiblefor another death we can capture this catwithout harming anyone  this is no time for wishful thinking im ordering you ed yes maam lead the way howd the tiger get across townwithout being spotted i dont know but wed betterfind her before meecham does hey shh shh it was just here its all right willa they dont all talk and draw pictures this last incident has left the boardwith no choice but to withdraw all funding if thats your decisiontheres nothing else i can say im sorry it really is a shame its too bad im out of a job theyve cut off all funding the animals are being shipped outto other zoos starting monday  im sorry it could not have happened at a worse time you mean for sophie what i had going for me wasmy position here having a place for her have the results come in on the tiger agent scully did the testthe tiger had been pregnant too its impossible theres no chancethose animals could get pregnant what if they were artificially inseminated thats a very fine and complex processi would have known unless it was done somewhere else  where what do you know about alien abduction youre youre kidding me you think that these animalswere taken aboard some spaceship i dont know but theres obviouslysome problem getting them back due to what may be an astrological variationa trouble with the timespace continuum these animals taken from cages are returnedtwo miles westsouthwest of this zoo  aliens impregnating zoo animals yes and harvesting the embryos  why maybe their own noahs ark to preserve the dnaof these animals that were depleting thats probably why youve never hada successful birth at this facility its the most ridiculous thingive ever heard i understand that you might think itsridiculous maybe you should ask sophie you think this is what shes so afraid of i believe shes pregnantand shes afraid of them coming for her baby sophie come here i wanna ask you a question its ok sophie come here  whats she saying she says man woman hurt she thinks you or your partnerare going to hurt her or me sophie man woman are here to help you they want to know about sophies baby  can i ask her a question yeah will you ask her if she wants to leave here sophie do you want to leave here she says light afraid sophie what are you afraid of tell me  what did she say she said baby go flying light i just finished off in the infirmary the sheriffs deputy camelooking to serve you papers i think its about sophie  what am i gonna do you cant leave sophie here if you want to protect her ive nowhere else to take her excuse me  willa ambrose yes im serving you with a court orderto release sophie into protective custody  what are you doing here ive come to ask for your help kyle  help with what sophie  theyve taken her into protective custody let her go willa theyre putting her in an iron cageas we speak without bars without windows itll kill her sophies been behind bars her entire life lether go home to the freedom she deserves freedom to what be killed by poachersand have her hands cut off as souvenirs  they promised shell be in a preserve shes mine kyle i wont let her go please come onwe can find a place for her here  a private reserve you know people no no thats against everything i stand for shes pregnant  what sophies pregnant i dont believe you willa  its true what if she was is the baby gonna live outits life behind bars too look willa she doesnt belong to youshes not your child she belongs with other gorillasnot selling tickets for a zoo you wont help me no  wanna see something interesting where dyou get this i was looking for a pen to finish my reportin willas office and that was in her drawer its a small world after all its ok sophie its ok honey sophie sophie sophie dont worry im with you i love you too willa willa are you here willa where are you willa i told you it happened exactlythe way it did with the tiger i heard the animals going crazy i got upto check on sophie and she was gone thats when i found kyle  any idea what he was doing at the zoo no a witness says that you visitedkyles office yesterday is that true yeah  for what purpose basically to tell him that hed won the zoo was being shut down and sophiewas being taken into protective custody did you ask him to help you take sophieto prevent her from being taken from you no that would be againsteverything kyle believed in but he helped you to rescue heroriginally isnt that correct he had a connection to you and tothis animal that went back several years whatever connection he and i hadwas over long ago but you asked him anyway to help you no then what was he doing here last nightand why did he give you this note i dont know i told you  did he make a habit of visiting the zoo if he did it was probably late at night after hed jumped over the fencelike a good wao soldier why dont you ask agent mulder what hethinks happened he has a novel theory maybe it was alien abduction scully can i talk to you for a second  you think shes telling the truth why do you say that kyle langs death and the disappearanceof the animal match the previous incidents yes and youve been pushingthis alien abduction angle  i still am but willas reactions are wrong to losing sophie i think she knows where sophie is and langdied cos he knows what shes capable of  you think she killed him i think shed do anything to protect sophie even wait atop a stack of cratesfor her former lover to walk underneath an examination of the body will give usa picture of what happened last night you do that and ill check out the warehouse  looks like youre in a hurry well there isnt much to hang around for im afraid there is i found evidencethat kyle died a wrongful death he was hit with a cattle prod theres gonna be an investigationso i have to read you your rights it was an accident kyle surprised ed  he wasnt supposed to be there ed meecham took sophie yes there was no one else to turn to where is she willa ed has her shes in some buildingon the road to boise put it down ed theres beenenough violence dont you think  i didnt kill kyle lang put down the gun and well talk about it i was only doing what she paid me to do  wheres the animal ed down the hall you show me wherewere gonna go there together come on  whats she doing throwing herself against the door shes gone crazy  shes scared yeah well shes gonna kill herself ok ed well youre gonna have to save her take your tranquilliser gunill be right

sorry lie still  wheres sophie can we get a paramedic in here  meecham hes been arrested we picked him up on the way to boisethats how we found you here  they took sophie who did  wheres willa shes making a statement about kyle lang i gotta talk to her  where is she shes gone  what did he do to her it wasnt ed she tried to tell me something  what is that that doesnt make any sense  what does it mean man save man weve just received a reportof a large animal spotted on the interstate  thats her shes heading back towards the zoo  where is she over there  what happened animal got hit by a car ran off into the field no no no no no sophie sophie no no ambrose and meecham have beencharged with manslaughter for langs death the courts will rule on this matterand justice will no doubt be served but the pall of a greater tragedy remains the motives of the silent visitors whoset these events in motion remain unclear is it a judgment ona global rate of extinction that has risen to one thousand timesits natural rate in this century an act of alien conservation of animalswe are driving hard toward oblivion and if so might it followthat our own fate and existence could finally be dependent on theconservatorship of an extraterrestrial race or in the simple words of a creature whoseown future is uncertain will man save man i made this
