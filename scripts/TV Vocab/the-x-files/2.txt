robert budahas  that photo was taken lastyear  when he was a test pilot for the military  stationed at ellens air base  four months ago budahas experienced a psychotic episode  and barricaded himselfin his home  the military police were called in  budahas was removed and hospitalized  for the treatment ofhis condition   which was what  the militarywill not comment  on the cause nature or status   the militarywill not comment at all  what doyou mean  mrs budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months  her inquiries have gone unanswered  last month she contacted the fbl  and reported it as a kidnapping  what reason would the military have to kidnap one oftheir own pilots  thats the 64000 question scully  since 1 963 six pilots have been listed  missing in action from ellens air base  the militarywill say  only that these pilots accepted the risks  offying experimental aircraft  yeah there are rumors those pilots were shot down at high altitudes  while theywere routinely penetrating russian airspace  there were other rumors too  lve been tracking this case  since it came through the boise office last month  last week it was deprioritized  they shelved this case without an investigation scully  so  so were going to the spud state to investigate a kidnapping  l dont get it mulder  does this have something to do with an xfile  l thoughtyou only liked those paranormaltype cases  am l missing something here  letsjust say this case has a distinct smell to it  a certain  paranormal bouquet  excuse me  leave this case alone agent mulder

like he was having a seizure  did he ever talk about his work  lt was never discussed even before the problems  l knew that he worked on top secret projects word gets around  but bob was always a patriot first  he took loyalty to his country as an oath  and now they treat us like strangers  l just want my husband back  you know the government is not above the law  they cannot withhold information  and then l think  well what ifhes  how would l support the family  you said word gets around  lm sorry  haveyou ever heard ofthis happening to anyone else  um yeah  verla mcclennons

wife ofa test pilot  you thank god just to have him home alive  mrs mcclennon  has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this  the stress l guess you have to understand  the military deals with things in a certain way  theyve given him plenty oftherapy and treatment  and lm thankful for that  theyve taken good care ofus  and they do volunteer for theirjobs  really anita  bringing the fbl to

lve got a 20 over  roger redbird assume fallback position   were opening the cage  redbird out  sometimes they come in real low and put on the skidders right  lts like  screeches   then theyjust hover

hardware right  probably roll it out for desert storm ll  cruise right over saddams house hed be like what  do they look anything like this  no  they look exactly like that  thanks  later dude   whats that  evidence   music playing   kids today huh  you believe it all dontyou  whywouldnt l  mulder did you see their eyes   lfl were that stoned  lfyou were that stoned what  you could have shown him a fying hamburger  and he would have told you thats exactlywhat he saw  l want to showyou something  this is a photo ofa ufo  that reportedly crashed in roswell new mexico in 1 947  now l know you dont believe that story  butjust hear me out  now ellens air base where were at right now  the same base that doesnt appear on your us government map  is supposedly one ofthe six sites where parts ofthe wreckage were shipped  mulder areyou suggesting that the military is fying ufos  no planes built using ufo technology  mulder come on  youve got two blurry photos  one ofthem taken almost 50 years ago  and another oneyou purchased today in a roadside diner  youre out on a big limb  tell me there isnt a remarkable resemblance  tell me one good reason why either ofthese photos is authentic  you saw what l saw tonight what doyou think theywere  just because l cant explain it  doesnt mean lm going to believe theywere ufos  unidentified fying objects  l think that fits the description prettywell   tell me lm crazy  mulder youre crazy  and it still doesnt explain to me  what happened to colonel budahas   knocking   you didnt come to raid my minibar did you   you ready for this  what  we got a message from mrs budahas  her husband came home last night   we gotyour message   sniffling   mrs budahas areyou okay  come inside  what is it  what whats wrong  that is not my husband  honey who are these people  that is not him  that is not my husband theyve done something to him   what areyou talking about  lts okayjust relax  lm special agent mulder from the fbl  were investigating your disappearance colonel budahas  lm wondering ifyou have any explanation  ofyourwhereabouts over the past four months   l was in the hospital  here on base  l think so  colonel budahas doyou mind ifl askyou your birth date  november 21  1 948   and the names ofyour kids josh and leslie  theyre right there  yeah   green bay fan  yes sir  betyou remember the super bowl of68 huh   don chandler

wings  l got this hotshot pilot friend  who said he could do an lmmelemann at a sustained eight gs  ls that possible  l l dont  l cant  anita  l cant remember  no  mulder would you explain to me whats going on  l think they rewired that mans brain  some kind ofselective memory drain  the brain doesnt work like that you cantjust erase certain files   then you explain it  there are types ofamnesia  this is not amnesia lts something far more deliberate and insidious  the science or medical technology  to do whatyou are suggesting does not exist  and neither does the technology to fy the aircraft we saw last night  they can do this  that man should have known the answer to the question  ltjust wasnt in his head anymore  scully eveniftheycould why would they  to control information  l think after his psychotic episode colonel budahas became a security risk  lt couldnt be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse  l think men like colonel budahas are incapable  ofdealing with the stress offying that aircraft  were talking about a technology so sensitive and advanced  that its taken almost 50 years to make it work  ufo technology scully   what the hell is this  hold on  please step outofthe car  you think ifmaybe we ignore him hell go away  please step outofthe car  guess not  special agent mulder fbl  were federal agents  you want to tell me what this is about  national security now get in your car  youll be escorted back toyour motel  youll pack and leave town immediately or assume the consequences  ofintense indiscretion  nothing under ldaho plate cc1 356  no plate registered under that number   sighs  thanks gail  no no no lm sure the other ones bogus too  bye  so who were those guys  l dont think it was those kids  theywere chasing away from the base last night  l think it was us  they knew we were coming before we ever arrived  and they returned colonel budahas as a decoy   theres something l didnt tell you  something else  a man in dc warned me to stay away from this case  he didnt give me his name and my phone was being tapped   what  whywould they go to all this trouble  out ofa need for security security ofwhat  l think theres a huge conspiracy here scully  theyve got a ufo here and theyll do anything to keep it a secret  including sacrificing lives and minds ofpilots because what ifthat secret got out  lf if that were true  it would be a national scandal  no youre not thinking big enough lfit were true  it would be confirmation of the existence ofextraterrestrial life  did you ever stop to think  that what we saw was simply an experimental plane  like the stealth bomber or this aurora project  doesnt the government have a right  and a responsibility to protect its secrets  yes but at what cost  when does the human cost become too high for the building ofa better machine  these are questions we have no business asking  our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding  lets get out ofhere mulder whileyou
