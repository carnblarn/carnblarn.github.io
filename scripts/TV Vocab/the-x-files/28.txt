car electrocution affectselectrolytic conduction disrupting the heartbeatand most of the autonomic systems death actually occurs from tissue damagenecrosis in the heart itself particularly in the sinusand atrioventricular nodes agent scully sorry to interruptyou have a call from a george hale  says its urgent excuse me  where are you national airport catching the shuttle to laguardia wanna join me in the big applefor an autopsy  whats going on i was hoping you could tell me i cant todaymy last class isnt over until 430 thats finei can have the me wrap the body to go  mulder youll get it by five whats the name doctor grissoms alpha wave analysisdefined the standard he revolutionised the waywe think about sleep his death is a tremendous loss to science how many other kindsof sleep disorder did he treat there are 38 differentdyssomnias and parasomnias doctor grissom treated them allwith an unprecedented success ratio maintaining that kind of batting averagemust have taken its toll excellence demands certain sacrifices  did he show signs of psychological stress not really except for his own occasionalbout of insomnia  but he was never delusional of course not  whats his story this patients night terrors prevent him from cycling out of rem sleepinto the more restful slowwave sleep its still experimental but were tryingto modify his brain wave patterns externally  how do you do that electrical stimulation of the occipital lobe creates visual and auditory hallucinations  its possible to alter somebodys dreams in theory yes i paid off your cab  i dont like being ditched like a bad date sorry if i hurt your feelings whats with this attitudeyou dont know the first thing about me exactly you know back at the academysome of the guys used to make fun of you  stop it or youre gonna hurt my feelings but some of us followed your work because we knew there was moreout there than they were telling us  yeah dr grissom didnt die from cardiac arrest  what is it i think you should take a look for yourself i havent even started on the chest and theabdomen and ill have more to tell you then i can make it in two hours where are we going  spleen or pancreas stomach i was just about to start on it oh uh this is alex krycekwere working the case together  good to meet you you too notice the pugilistic attitude of the corpse this condition generally occursseveral hours after death its caused bya coagulation of muscle proteins when the body is exposedto extremely high temperatures  like fire this degree of limb flexion is observed exclusivelyin burnrelated victims  there was no fire and no epidermal burns to indicate that but when i opened up the skulli found extradural haemorrhages which can only be caused by intense heat somehow this man sufferedall of the secondary but none of the primary physiologicalresponses to having been in a fire any theories i cant even begin to explain what couldhave caused it i mean its almost as if what as if his body believedthat it was burning  with sapphire and cubic zirconiumbaguettes all in a 14carat gold band now normally this ring retails for 1350 well i think itd be a value at 900 i saw it in a big department storelast week for 1000 but you will not believewhat we are offering it to you for i mean isnt that wonderful you left the door open willig preacher not a good idea leaving your door openin this neighbourhood you never know whos gonna drop by damn what are you doing here  how long you been in town not long you want a beer how you doing henry huh huh how you been how am i doing im uh trying to forget you knowim trying to get it out of my head no luck huh no im uh still fighting it you know i keep seeing the faces every day i see ah whats the difference were all going to hell right where you think weve beenthe last 24 years but after thiswherever he sends us is gonna seem like like a hawaiian vacation what do you want here preacher you killed him didnt you you killed grissom i saw it on tv he had to pay henry all of us have to answerfor what we did over there we cant get away from it no he retains not his anger for everbecause he delights in mercy he will turn againhe will have compassion on us he will subdue our iniquities henry and he will cast all our sinsinto the depths of the sea its all right henry its all over now the victim was henry willigunemployed lived on disability no indication of forced entry or struggle no abrasions or contusionsor trace evidence in the body cause of death is being listed asburst aneurysm  why did your friend from homicide call us because a medical examiner called him the autopsy revealed 43 internalhaemorrhages and skeletal fragments which doesnt happen spontaneously  not without corresponding external trauma what does the me have to say about it he said if he didnt know otherwisehed swear they were gunshot wounds whats this scar right here his records say the only surgeryhe had was an appendectomy unless they got to his appendixthrough his neck maybe it happened in vietnamwillig did a tour with the marines in 1970  im sure they didnt keep the best of records willig was a marine so where do marines receivebasic training on the east coast parris island where grissom was stationedfrom 1968 to 1971 which means that he and willigwere there at the same time 24 years ago there we go willig was assignedto special force and recon squad j7 of 13 original membershes one of two survivors till yesterday which leaves us with one person who cantell us what happened at parris island ive been supervising mr coles treatmentsince i admitted him 12 years ago im afraid you wont find himvery cooperative though we just want to ask hima few questions about his military service he doesnt respond very well toauthority figures is that why you put him in isolation weve had to house mr cole in this section because he was interfering withour treatment of other patients  how was he interfering he was disrupting their sleep patterns with psychiatric patientsthe circadian cycles must be maintained excuse me but exactly howwould cole disrupt their sleep here we are mr colethere are some gentlemen here who  you discharged him two days ago i certainly did not dont you think id remember if i did i was on shift and you signed the orderyourself that is your signature isnt it lets get coles face out on the wire  mulder mr mulder ive obtained informationthat might assist your work but you must exercise discretionwhen we meet if anyone follows you i wont be there  who are you who i am is irrelevant  why are you trying to help me you think i want to be here agent mulder  why are you trying to help me you think i want to be here agent mulder i dont want to be here  what is this data from a topsecret military project born of the idea that sleepis the soldiers greatest enemy grissom was conducting sleepdeprivationexperiments on parris island not deprivation eradication  why why else to build a better soldier sustained wakefulness dulls fearheightens aggression science had just put a man on the moon so they looked to scienceto win a losing war and willig and cole were the lab rats lab rats with the highestkillratio in the marine corps is cole behind whats happening now im not here to do your thinkingagent mulder all i know is augustus colehasnt slept in 24 years theres someone else you should see another squad memberreportedly killed in action  i thought cole was the last his name is on the envelope  how do i contact you you cant  i may need more you still dont get it do you closing the xfiles separatingyou and scully was only the beginning the truth is still out there but its never been more dangerous the man we both knewpaid for that information with his life a sacrifice im not willing to make where were you someone matching coles description justrobbed a drugstore hes in a nearby motel  is he alive he was when the night manager saw him so where were you detective horton im agent krycek this is agent mulder ive been waiting for you i tried holding theswat guys back but theyre getting antsy cole didnt steal dime onefrom that drugstore just some pills freeze inside now officer down we got two officers down both criticalrequest emergency vehicles immediately roger i copyon your officers being down whats going on here mulder these two officers they shot each other also described in the report isan experimental neurosurgical procedure designed to inducea permanent waking state the procedure involved cutting part ofthe brain stem in the midpontile region which would explain henry willigs scar a similar scar should alsobe evident on augustus cole postop treatment includeda regimen of synthetic supplements to replenish the organic deficitscaused by prolonged lack of sleep this is consistent with the antidepressantscole robbed from the pharmacy these drugs maintainserotonin levels in the blood serotonin being the primary substanceproduced during sleep it is theoretically possible that this procedurediminished the subjectsneed for sleep but i can neither quantify nor substantiateits success without further evidence  scully the second officer is still in a coma so i dont think we can count on himto tell us what happened im going over these reports you faxed metheyre incredible the military already sent troops throughradioactive clouds they had to top that sleep eradication doesnt explainthe shooting of those officers or the anomalous autopsy resultson willig and dr grissom i learnt at grissoms clinicwhat happens to a persons cortex when you stimulate it with electricity they have visual and auditory hallucinationsany med student can tell you that what if that stimuluswere to come from a remote source what if cole has developed the abilityto project his unconscious are you suggesting cole killedthose people with telepathic images think about it scullyin all those years without rem sleep maybe cole bridged the waking world andthe dream worldthe collective unconscious and what if by existing consciouslyin the unconscious world hes developed the ability to externalisehis dreams and effectively alter reality even if youre right youll havea better chance of finding cole if you work up a profileand try and surmise his next move all right ill sharpen my pencilsand ill see you later ill be right there krycek  where are you going to check on another member of the squad  see if he can tell us something sounds like your new partners working out hes all right he could usea little seasoning and wardrobe advice  hes more open to extreme possibilities than i was than i assumed he would be must be nice not having someonequestioning your every move poking holes in all your theories oh oh yeah it its great im surprised i put up with you for so long youd better go ill read over this report againand see what else i can come up with ok clear this up salvatore matola are you here to shoot meyou gonna kill me no were with the fbi we just wanted to ask you some questions why did you think we were here to kill you  i dunno you know about willig and grissom huh i read about it in the paperfigured they were finally killing us all off who hey sal can you spare a few minutes yeah i guess so i got a break coming up spare a few minutes i guess they said itd be like living two lifetimes and that at first thats what it was like not having to sleep an all made us feel likenothing could touch us you know uh wed do 24hour patrols night ambushes you knowthat type of thing  and you never got tired no not so that we had to sleep and then nothing that the pills couldnt fix  serotonin yeah how long did this go on quite a while id say quite a while until we stopped taking ordersfrom company commander in saigon the entire squadron went awol yeah something like that  well then who did you take orders from we didnt we just made up missions as we went along till it didnt matter any morewho we were killing farmers women outside of phu bai there was this school and uh they were just kids no one ever tried to stop you no sir police suspect augustus cole may bebehind the murders of willig and grissom you mean preacher thats what we used to call him he was always reading from his bible you know saying this and thatabout judgment day saying that one day we were gonnahave to pay for what we were doing thats thats what he said back thenthats what hed say but why grissom he was never incountryhe wasnt even part of the squadron sure he was he made us what we are  him and dr girardi whos dr girardi the other doc on the projectthe one who did the surgeries on us its because of him that i havent slept a night in 24 years im still not clear whyyou think cole will go after girardi cole sees himself as an avenging angel he thinks everyoneresponsible for the atrocities directly or indirectly must be punished yeah but why nowwhy after all these years phu bai was one of the bloodiest massacresof the war over 300 children slaughtered and unlike my laino us troops were ever charged the 24th anniversary of the massacrewas two days ago  mulder i think ive found francis girardi hes a professor of neurosurgery at harvard  do you have his number in boston yes but hes coming to grissoms funeral  when tonight he arrives at bronx station at 730 get a photograph to the security deskso we know who were looking for got it  mulder fbi you got a photo for me right here stay here ill cover the other side federal agent drop your weapon drop it mulder you all right girardi where is he girardis not here i saw him he was mulder you were shouting and waving your gunaround but girardi never showed no girardi was here so was colewe just missed them mulder if theyd been herei would have seen them im telling you mulder they werent here ok theres nothing hereso lets rewind the tape start with a small window of time say 1935 to 1945 if you dont find anything within thattime frame open it up one minute at a time with all these cameraswe should be able to see something can we talk for a second whats the problem you still havent answeredmy question about what happened  i told you i thought i saw girardi come on you just about killed someone and we both know im covering for youby keeping it between us  all right what do you want to know just the truth  theres things that i need to know my ideas are usually not very popular i told you i wanna believebut i need a place to start i think cole possesses the psychic abilityto manipulate sounds and images to generate illusions thatare so convincing they can kill hows that for a theory puts a whole new spin on virtual realitybut at least it begins to explain some things agent mulder  see this car in the upperright corner yeah it wasnt there five minutes ago  where is this thats track 17 its a restricted part of the yard what are you doing this is insane you cant do this to me you cant hold me responsible i was following orders just like you the lord hates the lying tongue its the truth the truth is what you did to uswhat you made us do no one made you do anythingyou volunteered the righteous shall rejoicewhen he sees the vengeance who is it whos there he shall wash his feetin the blood of the wicked who is it i cant see without my glasses you dont need to see to know who it isyou know who it is he shall pay as the judges determine he shall give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burn for burn wound for wound strike for strike as he has disfigured a manso shall he be disfigured and he who kills a man shall be put to death hes still alive put pressure on the woundon the back of his neck and radio for help now this is agent krycekrequesting emergency assistance my locations track 17in the freight warehouse step away from the edge corporal cole im a federal agentplease step back go ahead  shoot me thats not why i came up here im putting down my gun i just wanna talk for a few minutesthen you can do whatever you want  im tired i know no man you dont know  you have no idea one minute is all im asking one minutes more than i care to give the bloods boiling in my veins i can feel the air stinging on my skin what the military did to you was wrongbut maybe your testimony can help they cut out a piece of my brain they made me into somebody else and i can never get backwhat they took away from me but i can stop themfrom taking anything more krycek put down the gunand get outta here krycek i said put down the gunand get outta here no good night he had a gun he was gonna shoot you you did the right thing they broke into my officewent through my files my computer i came down as soon as security calledbut the report was already gone someone went to a lot of troublestealing our copies to keep this a secret without that report as evidence skinnersnot gonna authorise an investigation he said its never been more dangerous skinner that man who leaked us the reportthe one whos been helping us you actually met with him he said closing down the xfilesis just the beginning that weve never been in greater danger do you trust him  do you know where he got this not yet but he got it which meanshes either found another source or another source has found him sir if i can recommend something youll see that ive outlinedseveral countermeasures  what about scully reassigning them to other sections seems only to havestrengthened their determination scullys a problem a much larger problem than you described every problem has a solution i made this
