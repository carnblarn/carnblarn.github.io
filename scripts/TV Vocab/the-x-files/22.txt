                what ho  what ho  hey lazard why do the night guys get a piece likeyou  and were stuckwith eel breath  its fate detective  conspiring to keep us apart  all right im out ofhere  seeya  you all right  you lost  i got her in the holding room but she wont say a word  youre asking me  becauseyou know how good i am with kids  yeah a regular mr greenjeans  hi  this is detective barbala  hes going to helpyou find your parents  hiya sweetheart  whats your name  michelle  everythings going to be all right okay  dont be scared now  michelle what  you said your first name is michelle  now whats your last name  bishop  bishop  michelle bishop  and where doyou live michelle  here in buffalo  what was that  did you hear that  clamoring  man somebody call an ambulance  mulder how did you hear about us  my brother my brothers a cop in baltimore  he told me aboutyourwork on the tooms case  he said you got a good feel for things out ofthe ordinary  look the truth is barbala neverwon  any popularity contests here at the 1 4  but hes still a cop you know  i guess thats why i cantjust let this rest  you said there was one witness  a little girl what did she say happened  she said there was another man in the room   it stands to reason that  i was right outside  there was nobody else there except barbala and the kid  soyou didnt get a description  ofwho the kid saw  im telling you there was no one else  listen the departments treating this as a suicide  but i got to tell you i knew this guy  theres no way he did himself  was he depressed  or under psychiatric care ofany kind  no the only time he ever looked at himself  was in the mirror  and he always liked what he saw  plusjumpers tend to open the window before theyjump  wheres the kid  she was released an hour ago  her mother picked her up  you dont really think the girl had anything to do with it  eightyears on the force  ive seen a lot ofstrange things  but im telling you this kid  somethingsjust not right about her  mulder long hair or short hair  short  like that  was his hair dark like mine  or lighter likeyours  like mine  what about a beard or a moustache  moustache  whispers  man like this  or this  whoa what happened  weird  i didnt even hit a key  must be a glitch in the new software  mulder michelle was his moustache like that  scully doyou have any idea  howyour daughter might have gotten there  buffalos halfan hour away by train  and the station is a fiveminute car ride  when i came home  mrs doughertywas locked in the wine cellar  i called the police immediately  and mrs dougherty is  michelles nanny  her latest that is  shes gone through four this year and its onlyapril  what seems to be the problem  michelle is the problem  how doyou mean  as hard as it is for a mother to admit  michelle is a disturbed child  oh i know this sounds terrible to say  but the truth is that sometimes she frightens me  frightens you how  shes not like other girls agent scully  tell me  shejust isnt  she doesnt have any friends  she hardly ever smiles  it breaks my heart but i cant comfort her  she says she sees things that i cant see  she hears peopleyelling in her head  last summer we had to cover our pool  jim was trying to teach her how to swim  but every time that michelle would get close to the water  she wouldjust start to scream  scream likeyouve never heard in all your life  your husband where is he now  were divorced   mrs bishop  mmhmm  this is the man michelle said she saw at the police station  doyou recognize him  no im sorry  she also mentioned a friend  someone named sheila   doyou know who that is  that would be dr braun  shes the developmental psychologist  at brylin hospital  michelle sees her twice a week  look at that  looks like a hawk  or a falcon  its beautiful   its called origami japanese paper folding  where did she learn how to do that  i have no idea  so harry youll put that face into the system   as we speak  can you give scully a ride back to the city  we have a autopsy at 700  im going to brylin hospital  see ifl can have a little chat  with michelles shrink  oh and check for burns or lesions on barbalas body  why  psychokinesis is usually associated  with an electrical charge  areyou saying michelle possesses the ability  to psychically project her own will  how else could a 60pound kid throw a 200pound detective  out the window  woman no i dont recognize him  i have no idea who he is  could michelle have fabricated him  quite possibly  as with many dissociative disorders  the intensity ofthe patients emotions  is often too much for one personality to process  so in defense  part ofthe personality splits itselfoff  as in schizophrenia  im afraid michelles diagnosis is not quite that simple  my primary challenge has been to discover  the source of her extreme rage  in most cases  its a traumatic event in the patients past  and in michelles case  occasionally i would leave  michelle alone for part ofour sessions  with this doll  each time a new doll  anatomically intact  and each time she dismembers and disfigures it  in exactly the same way  at first i thought she was being abused  but after a number ofsessions with her parents  i became convinced there was something else  behind michelles anxiety  something much deeper  much more elusive  any theories  frankly no  im at a loss  haveyou tried deepregression hypnosis  ive found hypnosis an unreliable approach at best  okay how haveyou been treating michelle  well the thorazine has been quite effective  in regulating her more bizarre behavior  im sure  haveyou observed any unexplained phenomena  in michelles presence   unexplained phenomena  inordinate physical strength psychic ability telekinesis  yourejoking ofcourse  i have a patient waiting agent mulder  ifyoull excuse me  note postmortem examination is being conducted  after subject was pronounced  note raised lesion  approximately seven centimeters below sternum  deep necrosis inconsistent with cause ofdeath  as pronounced by dr gilder  and suggests localized electrocution  but a further tissue analysis will be necessary  excuse me  could i talk toyou for a second  i just started the autopsy  yeah um  i dont think hes going anywhere  will you uh  take a couple for scale please  thankyou ill be right back  so what doyou think  scully looks like a match  yeah  names officer charlie morris  used to work narcotics out ofthe 27  doyou know him  no before my time  where is he now has he been transferred  you could say that  agent scully this guys been dead for nineyears  which means that little girl saw a ghost  this way please  he was killed in chinatown gangland style  allegedly by the triads  although no arrests were ever made  ifyoure going to tell me  you think michelle bishop saw a poltergeist  you found a lesion on barbalas body  you said it could have been caused  by an intense concentration ofelectrothermal energy  could have been being the operative phrase  i wont know for sure until the lab results are in  why is it still so hard foryou to believe  when all evidence suggests extraordinary phenomena  because sometimes  what  iooking for extreme possibilities  makes you blind to the probable explanation  right in front ofyou  this is the face that michelle bishop saw  she walked right by here  and she saw the face ofcharlie morris  which means there werent any ghosts  fying around the precinct  doyou have the police report describing morris death  yeah i have whats been declassified  why  does it describe how he was murdered  yes i told you it was a signature hit  give me the grisly details  his arm was severed just below the shoulder  presumably by a chain saw  and his right eye was gouged out  this is what michelle did to a dozen dolls  in her shrinks office  hell ofa coincidence wouldntyou say  before we discount anything we should  find out more about charlie morris  i got the address ofhis partner on the force  hopefully he can tell us something  detective fiore were with the fbi  can we talk toyou for a minute  doyou know this man  you mind ifwe do this out here  i dont want to wake mywife  this wont take long  sure i know him thats charlie  charlie morris  you two were partners  we rode together his first nine months out ofthe academy  what can you tell us about the circumstances  surrounding his death  that matter is still under investigation  and so i cant comment on it  were under the direct authority  ofcaptain gershom at the 1 4th precinct   i neverworked out ofthe 1 4  whats all this about  we believe that the death  of detective barbala can be linked  to the death ofofficer morris  linked how i thought barbala fipped his wig  andjumped out a window  did you know him  by reputation  whats all this got to do with charlie  thats what we need your help with  the police report said morris was killed offduty  right best we can figure it was some kind ofpayback  forwhat  the organized crime division  was doing a major sweep in chinatown  the triads  heavy busts went down against the woo shing woo  a lot ofsmack never made it to the street  you can bet there were some pissedoffpeople  playing mahjongg that week  soyou think morris was killed  as a warning to back off  i think they picked a cop any cop  and theywhacked him  who is it tony  its nothing to worry about honey  just some people from the fbi  asking about a case im working  sir would you mind  hey its the weekend you guys mind  get me at the squad   first thing monday morning okay  sure  good luck  is it me or did we just get the brushoff   did you notice her hands  what  he said she was sleeping  but her hands were dusted with baking four  its not a big deal all right  dontjerk yourselfaround  youre acting like a little bug  theywere fbi  so what  they start sniffing around too much  theyre going to turn something up  relax theyrejust people like us going through the motions  then how are they  connecting charlie to barbala  and what do they know  huh nothing  come on  were going to citibank right now  forwhat  the safety box  what should we do tony huh  make a donation to the little sisters for the poor  dump it somewhere  tony theres only two ofus left now  thats over a million each  take it all i dont care  doyour dream on the beach in costa rica orwherever  the hell it is you want to do it  you think i like this huh  selling disability insurance to morons  well sir uh  excuse me but what ifyou should breakyour neck  on the shore or loseyour leg in a car crash  you listen to me tony  we agreed to wait ten years  and that is exactly what were going to do  i listened toyou once before and lookwhat happened  nobody not me not barbala  wanted to see charlie wind up like that  we werejust trying to scare a little sense into him  it was an accident  end ofstory  and you better pull yourself together tony  excuse me sir  hey what  hey hey open the door  hey  hey open the door  hey open the door  hey  open the door open the door  open the door hey  open the door  hey  hey hey  hey open the door  hey  for gods sake  help me  screaming  a patrol unit picked her up  a few blocks away from the bus stop  whats going on  we dont know  all we know is thatyour daughter  has witnessed two deaths in the past two days  shes only eightyears old  she couldnt possibly have done anything  mrs bishop no one is accusing michelle ofanything  shesjust a little girl  is there anything thatyou have not told us  is there anything at all thatyou can think of  that might shed some light on what happened tonight  no  sighs  well this police station  has a designated room at the sheraton  an officerwill takeyou and michelle over there  why is this happening to us why  can i talk toyou for a minute  im sorry excuse me  listen to this  you know that guy that bought it tonight  leon felder  before he started peddling life insurance  he was a cop out ofthe 1 4  guess who his partner used to be  rudy barbala  scully four cops  three ofwhom are now dead  their only connection being a drug bust in chinatown  almost nineyears ago  and a little girl from orchard park  morris fiore barbala and felder  whats wrong with this picture  well for one thing  fiore said he only knew barbala by reputation  right so whywould he say that  i dont know  hmm  what  theres a page gone from morris homicide file  wonderwhere it could be  is there a log sheet  should be  yeah  tony fiore checked out this afternoon  mrs fiore were sorry for the early hour  but is your husband home  no hes not  he never came home last night  maywe come in  hey scully  look familiar  mrs fiore he said he was working a double shift  but when i called the precinct  he wasnt scheduled  itsjust not like him not to call  does your husband have any family or close friends in the area  that he might go to ifhe were in trouble  ive been on the phone all night  is he in any trouble  mrs fiore did your husband ever mention  a detective by the name of rudy barbala  or an expolice officer named leon felder  i dont think so  someoneyou might have had dinnerwith once  a friend oftonys from work  a nameyou cant remember anything  we dont normally socialize with other cops  mrs fiore i couldnt help noticing  your origami collection  did you do theseyourself  oh no not me  no that was charlies hobby  charlie  my first husband  he was born injapan  his father was stationed there  not charlie morris tonys expartner  yeah  i was waiting for him to come home too  nineyears agojust like this  he was working on a whole set you know from the painting  the only animal he never got to was the giraffe  see right there behind the zebra  michelle is eightyears old that means she was conceived  at roughly the same time that officer morris was killed  do me a favor mulder  let me say it reincarnation  metempsychosis transmigration  reembodiment call it whatyou will  all based on the coincidence  that michelle bishop and officer morris  both practice the obscure art ofpaper folding  what about the composite drawing  and the dolls and the fact  that michelle was witness to two deaths that can be tied to charlie morris  so what you think hes back like peter proud  to avenge his murder  its not so farfetched scully  reincarnation is a basic tenet ofmany major religions  that still doesnt explain how an eightyearold girl  can kill two grown men  well individuals with strong pastlife memories  often exhibit enhanced psychic abilities  esp telekinesis  so where does that leave us  one short step away  from proving the preexistence ofthe human soul  doctor on the count offive  tell me where you are now  one two three four five  doyou know whereyou are   yes  where  tell me whereyou are  at home  what time ofday is it  nighttime  and how old areyou  twentyfour  no we cant  we cant do this  its wrong  whats wrong  what cantyou do  its all right  you can trust me  no i cant i cant  you can trust me  i cant i cant  this is dangerous and irresponsible  dr spitz has conducted hundreds ofthese sessions  ifthis continues you could push michelle deeper into withdrawal  is it any more dangerous than pumping her full ofthorazine  theyre killing me theyre killing me  thats enough  mulder please mrs bishop  no no no  its okay its okay  its over its over its over  theyjust left  we almost had it scully  we were right there  i know  well have to try it again  mrs bishop wont go for that  not in this lifetime anyway  well we have to change her mind  how and to what end  i mean what exactly  doyou hope to discover by all this  the truth  what really happened to charlie morris  well find the truth when we find fiore  ifwe find fiore and ifhes still alive  scully you saw what happened in there  what i saw was some traumatized little girl  who for no apparent reason  has some connection to charlie morris  all evidence suggests that michelle bishop is charlie morris  short ofher growing a moustache  how much more apparent does it have to become foryou to accept it  okay letsjust say that by some small miracle  you manage to convince michelles mother  and the next hypnoregression provides you with everything  you could possibly hope for  no grandjury is going to listen  to that kind oftestimony  we still will not have an actionable case  the inconclusive results  of michelles pastlife regression  do not shake my basic beliefin hypnosis  as a tool for psychological healing  whether or not it offers us definitive proof  ofprevious lifetimes is another matter  however in this particular case  all other explanations seem to be even more wanting  dr spitz how old areyou  twentyfour  no we cant we cant do this  its wrong  whats wrong  what cantyou do  rewinding tape  and how old areyou  twentyfour  no we cant  rewinding  twentyfour  no no l  il want to be here in case he shows up  yeah thanks again  ill uh ill call you the minute i hear anything  okay yeah okay byebye  knockat door  tony  tony  tony  i checked the windup profiles theyre up to speed  which means  whatever this image is it was recorded in that room with the girl  how is that possible  there was a documented case in the early 70s  ofa man from porlock ohio  who could infuence undeveloped film  he could create shapes on the negative from his mind  i dont know how much ofthis noise i can clean up  it depends on the strength ofthe latent image  door opens  i tracked him down  hes retired in palm beach  you were right agent scully  he backed up all his records on disk  pathologists are paranoid by nature  well he faxed me the missing page  from the autopsy report  great  well apparently  charlie morris did not die as a result ofhis wounds  it says here theres a frothing offuid  in the respiratory tract  that indicates death by drowning  he was drowned and then mutilated  to make it look like a signature execution  dr yamaguchi said  that there were no signs ofsubmersion  such as goose skin orwrinkled fesh  except for around the face and head  thats right  suggesting that he was killed  in either a bathtub or a toilet   except  except forwhat  the marked bradycardia  it indicates a raised plasma sodium level  he was killed in sea water  anita  anita  tony  tony whats going on where haveyou been  listen i know somethings going on  i need you to listen to me right now  go upstairs and pack a bag  why what kind oftrouble areyou in  i think someones trying to kill me   who  i dont know  whywould anybody want to kill you  tell me whats going on  will you pleasejust do what im asking you  please  im your husband and i loveyou  and i need you to trust me on this okay  almost there  what ive done is to map the frequencies ofthe interference  coefficients for sine on this monitor  cosine on that one  now using an algorithm program  i can remove the frequencies  iike this  presto  what the hell  mulder what is it  you said salt water right  right so  charlie morris was drowned  in his own tropical fish tank and thats the last thing he saw before he died  we better hope michelle bishop is at home tucked in bed  tony  somebody left this on our doorstep tonight  doyou know who  answer me tony  you stay here and keep the door closed  anita tony areyou all right  tony answer me  crashing noise  tony  tony please  whos there  whats happening  crashing continues  mulder  they said theywerejust going to talk toyou  talk some sense intoyou  what was i supposed to do huh  all you had to do was take the money man  why didntyou just take the money  screaming  whats going on tony  go check upstairs  michelle  this wont make right what happened  i cant get out  whos there  i cant get out  tony  tony  tony  im sorry  i knew what they did to charlie  i was a part ofit and i never said anything  i couldnt  oh no  i just wanted to take care ofyou  who else would have taken care ofyou  please please dont hurt him anymore  mulder
