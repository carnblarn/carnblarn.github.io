on december 121949a royal navy battleship disappeared between leeds and cape perry the sea wascalm the weather sunny in 1963 at the height ofthe cuban missile crisis a soviet fleet left from here for havanaall six vessels vanished without a trace i counted nine unexplained disappearanceseach passed through here the 65th parallel  another bermuda triangle more like a wrinkle in time if lieutenant harper is any indication  wrinkle in time wh heard about the philadelphia experiment it was a programme during world war twoto render battleships invisible to radar but it was discontinued and most of thescientists were relocated to los alamos except none of themever made it to los alamos  where were they sent roswell new mexico are you suggesting thatthe experiment used alien technology nine months after the alleged crashof a ufo in roswell the uss eldridge disappeared altogetherfrom the philadelphia navy yard to reappear minutes latermiles away in norfolk virginia thats not possible not withoutdefying laws of time and space those physicists may have beentrying to manipulate wormholes on earth  wormholes portals where matter interfaces with time at a decelerated or accelerated rate i bet the military never stoppedthe work it began 50 years ago  thats what you think happened to harper ill know soon enough  im booked on an 830 flight to norway have you let skinner in on this ive given myself a 24hour head start beforei give him my report i want this one myself im going with you if that really was lieutenant harperi wanna know what happened to him nei nei det er altfor farlig what is it mulder why are they so afraid my father spent the better partof his life at sea he had a healthy respect for the oceanbut he never feared it i see fear in these mens eyes brundtland couldnt havetaken you up there anyway a ship has to be classified ice classbefore it can even go past the lofoten basin my name is trondheim henry trondheim the ship you want is the zeal its a 50ton trawlerwith a double hull its my ship  youre american i was born and raised in pensacola i ran a charter business therei got fed up with tourists how do you feel about the seanorth of beerenberg this time of year itd be ten hours each way  so youve been there a few times got some of my best hauls out of there  why is everyone else so afraid to go there well legends they grew up on stories what stories a huge stone came out of the skycrashed into the pack ice  a meteorite an evil god they worship it by stayin away so exactly what is it thatyoure lookin for up there a number of things how good are you about as good as youre going to getconsidering no one else will take you there  when can we leave as soon as we shake on a price  feeling any better oh lucky you inherited your fathers legs  what his sea legs its been 12 hoursyou said itd take ten whats goin on i told you before the visibility is lousy ive never seen it this thick  how much longer till we get there well were right where you wanna be i even think weve gotwhat youre looking for except one minute its in front of usand the next its not like somethings messing with my radar and my navigation system  i cant explain it kaptein pass p were gonna hit halvorsen check the hull for damage i dont get itthis is what youre lookin for its the uss ardentits a destroyer escort all right what do you want with it anyway its a ghost ship i mean look at all this corrosion no onesbeen aboard this vessel in 20 30 years scully lets check the crew quarters first mulder they almost look mummified hm like theyve been deada very long time except for this strange residue  what was that an engine its my ship  no thats my ship hey  somebodys taken my ship hey hey  thats my ship trondheim no all right try it again no what is it its caked with the same residuethats covering everything so we cant even send a distress signal the engines so corroded you cant even tellwhat it is ive never seen anything like it halvorsens trying to salvage some partsbut basically we are dead in the water the radios dead too somebodys not tellin mewhats goin on here now look that ship was not justmy livelihood that was my life i have a right to some straight answers what were seeing here may bethe result of a military experiment military experiment a time bend where matter movesthrough time at an accelerated rate  tell me in english time may be speeding up right thats almost as crazy as halvorsenstheres a rock that comes from the sky this ship was launched in 1991 i dont know how else to explain the extentof the corrosion or the decay of the bodies youre not buyin any of this are ya agh oh god  what happened his skulls been fractured whos that halvorsen who are you captain barclay commanding officer uss ardent there you go captain barclay according to your logafter the navigation system failed several of your crew memberssaw something in the sea a growing light itit came up through the fogin the middle of the night like it was on fire  any idea what it might have been power loss everythin stopped everythin even the sea even the wind then the ship my ship she began to bleed from the hull through the rivet seams hes a drunkard hes a drunkard and he killed halvorsen to hell with himi dont have to listen to his lies im no liar it happened first to some of my men then to all of em what happened time got lost its ok captain you can take it easy were gonna dowhatever we can to help you out what can you do you cant do anythin im 35 years old  theres no way he killed halvorsen i agree the blow was deliveredwith considerable strength and he cant evenhold a glass with two hands that means theres somebody else on board you were a good first mate you left me alone and you did your job its a shame this had tohappen to you so young gud vre med deg put it down put down the pipe put it down  i could kill you back off  he killed halvorsen he may help us figure out what happened look at him he hasnt aged back off his names olafsson  you know him everybody in tildeskan knows him hes a pirate whaler hes a wanted criminal he supplies whales to the japaneseblack market blues belugas sperm ask him how he got here hvordan kom du hit g til helvete i dont need a translator for that well question him lateri dont wanna leave scully alone  get in the hull i think we found who killed halvorsen hed have killed me tooif it wasnt for mulder the log says four norwegianswere picked up when their vessel sank i guarantee olafssons mentook my boat and left him stranded its just like them to slit each others throats we should ask the captainsome more questions captain barclays dead i dont know how it happenedit was just in the last 15 minutes its just like those men below its more than rapid ageing mulderits as if hes turning into a pillar of salt  is that what the substance is it seems to be crystalline but beyond that were all tired lets stow the captains bodytie up olafsson so we can all get some rest ill take first watch in case hes not alone  scully hm i just fell asleep  you want a few more minutes no im up scully mulder what happened to you time accelerationis an equation mulder a theory then theoretically its possiblewhat else could it be whatever it is it isnt a time warp none of us has observedthe phenomena recorded in the ships log  no evidence indicates this is a time warp were evidence were ageing by the minute if this is rapidageing phenomenawhy hasnt our hair greyed then what about him huh what about him why isnt he getting old hvorfor blir du ikke gammel  relax trondheim save your energy i dont have to listen to you  its because of you that we got into this nobody twisted your arm i signed on to bring you here not to die  what do you know about free radicals is this a quiz theyre highly reactive chemicalscontaining extra electrons they can attack dna they can cause ourbody tissue and cell membranes to oxidise  grow old you mean its the prevailing theory on how we age  something is triggering that reaction in us this is just a theory but what if this ship is drifting towardsanother metallic source like a meteor maybe its deep in the oceanor embedded into an iceberg but the two could be actingas positive and negative terminals with the ocean itselfbeing a kind of giant battery that electromagnetic energycould be exciting the free radicals and effectively oxidisingevery piece of matter in its field makes sense scully the organic equivalentto rust would be rapid premature senescence what the hell captain barclay said the ship was bleeding its not blood scully its rust trondheim you keep an eye on olafsson  where are you going mulder where are we going im not sure yet but we donthave much time to get there dyou see this yellow pipeits the only one that hasnt corroded through olafsson and his men why would they hole up here this is the only drinkable water on the ship we were both wrong scully its the water  all the other waters been contaminated how something must have got into thedesalination tanks where the water is stored but the water in the sewage systemis recycled it doesnt come from the sea if youre right then captain barclaysdrinking binge is what kept him alive and the water from this tankwill do the same for us but it doesnt sound liketheres very much left you were supposed to watch him i feel pretty bad about it i shouldnt have dozed off what do you want me to say hes gone  i wanna know what happened i can ask the same of you you tied him up theres nothing wrong with my knotthis was severed i dont like being interrogatedi dont owe you any explanations  trondheim let go of me look we have a lot of work to do here ill need blood and urine samplesfrom both of you  what for we found out what caused the ageing what is it nowthe two of you are full of theories first its one thing then anotherby the time you figure it out well be dead something got into the desal tanks butthe water in the sewage system is untainted it kept olafsson alive this longmaybe itll slow the process in us this is good news isnt it so what happens now it has been 18 hours 45 minutessince the onset of symptoms rudimentary blood tests revealed impossiblyhigh concentrations of sodium chloride salt though the contaminated wateritself is not saline it appears to catalyse existing body fluidscausing massive and rapid cellular damage the untainted water slowed the degenerativeprogression in trondheim and me but mulder has fared less well perhaps because of the dehydrationhe suffered on the way here i think i just lapped george burns ill be right back if youve got something to say say itbut dont hover behind me like that  the water isnt helping him then maybe we should double his ration  what for a lake of water wont help him we dont know that for sure  not yet look at him  weve wasted too much water on him who are you to decide you dont have to be a doctorto see that he isnt gonna make it but you and me scully you and me wed betterstart lookin out for ourselves mulders urinalysis continuesto indicate his kidneysfailure to excrete the substanceim calling heavy salt whether the untainted water from the sewagesystem is even helping him at all is unclear what does remain clear to meis that i cant give up trying trondheim  what are you doing listen to this you know what that is its a funeral bell theres only a few gallons left maybe less theres enough to keep usall alive for a few more days or one of us alive long enough to be rescued dont come any closer what are you gonna do shoot me trondheim listen to me the navy knows where we are they knowthese coordinates and theyll be here soon  so why dont we go back to the mess hall why dont you just shoot me if you think that im gonnalet mulder have another drop trondheim trondheim youre almost out of pages its good you kept a record trondheims locked himselfin the sewage hold hes backflushed all the waterand hes keeping it for himself i looked everywhere and this is all i could find its sardine juice half a dozen lemons and uh the water from a snow globe  its not evian but you go ahead and drink it  no mulder its the only logical choice youre a woman your life expectancy is greater and yourbody retains more water and fatty tissues more reason for you to drink it youll have a much greater chanceof surviving until help comes  dont do this mulder dont dont be so stubborn scully you know im right well there isnt much liquidto make a difference anyway there might be no what was that the outer hull must have finally corrodedthrough which means were taking on water mulder the water i cant open the door help help me help me help help help me help me oh oh i always thought when i got olderid maybe take a cruise somewhere but this isnt exactly what i had in mind the service on this ship is terrible scully its not fair its not our time we still have work to do mulder when they found me after the doctors andeven my family had given up i experienced somethingi never told you about even now its hard to find the words but theres one thing im certain of as certain as i am of this life we have nothing to fear when its over im so tired you should sleep agent fox mulder lost consciousness atapproximately 430 this morning 12 march there is nothing more i can do for him or for myself supplies are exhausted no foodor liquid consumed for over 24 hours the outer hull most probably flooded thoughfor now the inner hull is supporting the ship among halvorsens belongingsi found a childrens book of norse legends from what i can tellthe pictures show the end of the world not in a sudden firestorm of damnationas the bible teaches us but in a slowcovering blanket of snow first the moon and the starswill be lost in a dense white fog then the rivers and the lakesand the sea will freeze over and finally a wolf named skollwill open his jaws and eat the sun sending the world into an everlasting night i think i hear the wolf at the door agent scully agent scully can you hear me mm yeah its been 36 hours since your rescue ive got you on dialysis with a highflux filter youre obviously responding well your electrolytesare almost back to normal and your fluid status has been corrected mulder where is he his endocrine systemwas more compromised than yours frankly we didnt think that hed make ituntil we discovered this based on your notes were giving himsynthetic hormones which seem to work whatever caused this is still out therei have to talk to a naval liaison  we have to salvage the ship agent scully the ship was taking on water it sank less than an hourafter you were rescued i made this
