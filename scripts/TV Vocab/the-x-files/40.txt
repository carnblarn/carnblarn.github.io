                i have lived with a fragile faithbuilt on vague memories from an experience that i couldneither prove nor explain when i was 12 my sister was taken from me taken from our home by a forcethat i came to believe was extraterrestrial this belief sustained me fuelling a quest for truthsthat were as elusive as the memory itself to believe so passionatelywas not without sacrifice but i always accepted the risks  to my career my reputationmy relationships to life itself easy hes an fbi agent his names mulder come on lets go get a frostbite bay stat lets get ready please  basal temps

found his keys where the fire was startedhes been missing since the incident could be well just be finding teeth and bone good afternoon reverend sistrunk these are agents scullyand mulder they want to ask you if dr prince burns in hells firefor his murder of the unborn if his damnation is gods will  is that what you think reverend i guess its a question of opinion in my opinion dr princes

photograph theres another one mulderhis name is dr james dickens  and mulder yeah hes right here in washington stay where you are scully ill pick you up agent mulder my name is ambrose chapel i work for the central intelligence agency i need to talk to you about the caseyoure working on  what case is that the murder of certain identical victims i have a story to tell agent mulderbelieve me you wanna hear it weve known of their existence for a decade we found out they werein the country last year who were they vague intelligence reportsreveal that early in the cold war soviet scientists stumbled on a geneticanomaly in sets of identical twins they isolated the dna material that gavethe twins their facial features hair colour and they were able to reproduce it  are you saying these men are clones by all outward appearances how did they get here the programme went by the code namegregor  the name given to every clone we believe the original gregor came herein the mid70s on a german passport using that same document they were ableto bring a small cadre of clones in several of which are in strategic positionsin the medical establishment for what purpose in the event of war they wouldmobilise simultaneously across the us to contaminate blood suppliessabotage pharmaceutical factories essentially destroythe countrys immune system if youve known about this for a yearwhy hasnt anything been done well this is where the story getsperhaps even more incredible secretly someone is allowing the gregorsto be systematically eliminated by a man who i believeis a russian spykiller in exchange for the suppressionof the programmes existence and to obtain the science that created it whats your business in this we share similar sentimentson our governments policies of denial which is why theyve beentrying to contact you  who the gregors youre obviously someone who might protectthem and bring these misdeeds to light what makes you think weve been contacted your inquiries into their deaths and your response to the ad i placed were talking statesanctioned murder if we can find them firstmaybe the truth can be known we know where one of these men may be ok lets go  who is it agents scully and mulder were with the fbi  dr dickens yes i believe youve been trying to contact us uh  may we come in dr dickens uh its ok sir theres nothing to be afraid of ill call the paramedics hes moving hes getting up ill call you back  you ok ok i just got the wind knocked out of medont lose him  go ok oh hes gone  where he blindsided me went up the fire escapebefore i could grab him im gonna go see if i canfind a way up on the roof  how are you feeling like i should have used the crosswalk a lot better than my phone maybe we should have dropped this case scully if our friend from the cia is rightthis is a big national security conspiracy our friend from the cia isabout as unbelievable as his story as is everything about this casewhat happened to trust no one mulder i changed it to trust everyonei didnt tell you i ran a full background check on this guy ambrose chapel is a 17year veteran specialintelligence clearance hes the real thing why would a man with his experienceneed our help and how could he let a man that hes beenlooking so hard for slip away so easily that doctor wasnt running awayfrom us mulder but agent chapel  i think youre being overly paranoid scully paranoid maybe it was agent chapelwho killed that field agent in syracuse shall i put that on my report to skinnerid be happy for you to explain it to him dammit mulder that is not my job youll pursue a case to the point of insanity and expect me to follow youthere has to be somewhere to draw the line three identical men are dead a fourthidentical man is alive and on the lam if this case seems like insanity to youfeel free to step away from it an fbi agent died because of this case those are the risks we takeyou either accept them or you dont we all draw our own lines i have to show you something i got these a week ago i stepped in something last nightthat ate clean through the sole maybe im paranoid but it was in the exactspot where chapel said the doctor escaped why dont you send itto our lab guys for analysis  and arrange for an autopsy bay an autopsy bay putting together my report for skinneri found something youll appreciate whoever killed that agent in syracuse was soclever no clear cause of death can be found no penetrating knife or gunshot wounds no ligature marksor abrasions from strangulation the toxicological is clean  and the blood work well its strange strange how theres evidence of polycythaemia excessive production of red blood cells  how excessive extremely the doctor has it in herethat the blood was curdled like jelly as if something caused the bloodto thicken or clot prior to death due to what possibly a coagulating agent but it wouldhave shown up on the toxicological didnt agent chapel say these doctorscould contaminate the blood supply couldnt one of those contaminantshave been used to kill this man i dont know mulder i there was a doctors bag i tookas evidence from the apartment  agent mulder yeah  assistant director skinners
