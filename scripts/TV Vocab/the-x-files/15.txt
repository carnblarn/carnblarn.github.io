are we doing tonight  gunshot  anyword from willis  still missing  he hasnt been home or checked in with the office  i heard something about a mutilation  yeah three fingers on dupres left hand  were severed by surgical shears  we lifted prints  theyre williss  he was chasing this guy almost a year  yeah he lived the case  it was all he thought about talked about  what areyou thinking  that maybe this is some kind ofposttrauma psychosis  like the way soldiers sometimes mutilate a dead enemy  that still doesnt explain  why he would just vanish  dupres partner  who was she  lula phillips  they met while she was serving  a tenyear sentence for manslaughter  at the womens correctional facility of maryland  he was a prison guard  until the warden found out their secret  according to lulas cell mate  they carried on quite a torrid romance  it says she was released on may 2 1 993  one week before the first robbery  at annapolis savings and loan  the 65yearold female teller was pistolwhipped  died from a subdural hemorrhage  because she didnt get the money fast enough  lovely couple  they took turns one pulling ajob  while the other one drove getaway  the two ofthem have killed seven people  and gotten away with close to 1 00000  thats a lot ofmoney  now she doesnt have to split it  were putting her face out there  iocal newspapers americas most wanted  am i boring you  theywere married  yeah last may in atlantic city so what  i dont think this was a simple necrophiliac mutilation  willis sliced and diced those fingers to get  at the wedding ring  anybody here  lula  baby baby baby  damn  scully its a left thumbprint  you can see that whoever held that cleaver  was using his left hand  whoever it was willis  willis is righthanded  i checked his pistol grip at the armory  bank surveillance tapes show dupre is lefthanded  im not sure whereyoure going  how long did willis fatline  just over 1 3 minutes  this is the ekg strip that recorded  his cardiac activity at the time  in your medical opinion what does that look like  it could be anything  an instrument malfunction electrical overload  but what does it look like  two heartbeats  dupre and willis  went into cardiac arrest at the exact same time right  right  which means for minutes both men  were technically dead  technically but we resuscitated willis  you resuscitated his body  mulder  two men died in that crash room  one man came back  the question is  which one  what can you tell me  about neardeath experiences agent scully  the usual stuff the tunnel the light  people rising up and viewing their own bodies  how doyou account for the phenomenon  some sort ofdissociative hallucinatory activity  did you know that halfofall adults  who have had a neardeath experience  cant wear a watch  the increased electrical activity in their bodies  renders the watches  inoperable  now i know  this sounds kooky  but as any biologist will tell you  when cells die and genetic material unfolds  tremendous energy is released  mulder dr varnes believes this burst ofenergy  is responsible for the transformational nature  ofthe experience  people do return profoundly changed  changed how  personality shifts perceived psychic abilities  increased zest for life  what about the negative consequences  theyre rare but apparently in the process ofdying  there is a window oftime during which the body is vulnerable  i dont understand  there was a pilot in my support group  who died in a commuter plane crash  along with his three passengers  this was a fewyears ago  he recalls foating up  and then feeling an overwhelming need  to return to his body  he was revived in the ambulance  the only survivor  it was soon after that that the visions started  visions ofmaking love to his wife in ways and places  that werent in his memory  a dead passenger on the plane was having an affair  with his wife  the dead passengers consciousness  survived through the pilot  what happened  the pilot became increasingly disoriented  a schizophrenic his doctor claims  until one day he strangled his wife with an extension cord  thats a nice story  i dont discount the neardeath experience  because it can be explained  by stimulation ofthe temporal lobe  i sense a big but coming  its my best guess  jacks disappearance can be explained  in psychological not supernatural terms  for instance  the stress ofthe case the trauma ofbeing shot  jacks personality  how well doyou know him  we dated for almost a year  he was my instructor at the academy  the plot thickens  we even had the same birthday  we used to celebrate in some dive in stafford  that had a slanting pool table  but it was always so hard  forjack to relax  it was impossible for him really  he was always so intense so relentlessly determined  doyou believe hes predisposed  to this type ofpsychotic episode  its a long way from saying jack had a neardeath experience  to saying his bodys been inhabited bywarren dupre  a long way  what the hell  youre such a creature ofhabit tommy  who the hell areyou  get out ofbed  i aint got no clothes on  get out ofbed  i dont want to shootyou lying down  areyou the rent man  cause im all paid up  come on you can go ask cosmo  shut up  where is she  wheres who  your sister  lula  i dont know  i was waiting to see her  on the news  what i tell you  check it out  the sounds busted  looks like theyll find her  beforeyou do pal  is that whatyou think  thats not what i think  i miss her tommy  i miss her so bad  thats why i came back  do i knowyou from somewhere  everything i see i see her  jesus man youre bleeding  even ugliness is beautiful because ofher  okay what areyou doing  you set us up tommy  you sold us out to the fbl  dupre  gunshot  neighbors heard a gunshot  but nobody bothered to check it out  the patrol guys responded this morning  to an anonymous 91 1 and found him here  except the rats found him first  the victims name was thomas phillips  thats lulas brother  theres not a lot offamily resemblance left  between the rats and the 45 he took  in the face  oh i hate this nicotine stuff  whats his story  hes single  hes lived here alone for seven months  a few priors small stuffmostly  b and e narcotics possession  nothing like his big sister  was the television turned on when they found him  no why  i dont thinktommy was a reader  since he doesnt own any books  from the position  ofthe body maybe he  was watching the tube  when he was shot  print kits over there knockyourselfout  out ofmyway ace  regulations state to gain access to a crime scene  you got to show me ld  looks like you were right  excuse me  jack  gunshots  is there a problem here  no i just dont have any ld  and would you tell this gentleman who i am  this is agentjackwillis  hes

you can even walk around  this is tommy phillips place right  jack  was he killed with a 45  as a matter offact he was  thats lulas weapon ofchoice  i know these people  ive been after them for a long time  were halfway there  you did open the book on this one  ill be there when its closed  all right  but as a colleague and as a friend  im recommending you undergo a medical evaluation  physical and

youre two months early  its from willis  i thoughtyou two had the same birthday  we do  well thats news to him  i asked him to sign it  you mean you tested him  after i found out evidence from the phillips murder is missing  what evidence  the print we lifted  our best lead is gone  someone stole it before the lab had a chance  to take a look at it  and you thinkwillis is responsible  im not sure willis is willis  can you at least accept  the possibility that during his neardeath experience  some kind ofpsychic transference occurred  cantyou accept the possibility that this isnt an xfile  aside from the expected level ofposttrauma stress  jack passed both ofhis evaluations  physical and psychological  anyway just because someone  forgets a birthday doesnt mean that hes been possessed  when i was studying for my medical boards  i forgot my birthday too  did you forget how to sign your name  this is a copy ofthe automobile requisition form  willis filed the day before he was shot  compare the signatures  like i said mulder stress  we both know it can significantly affect  someones cursive standard  im afraid this doesnt prove a thing  phone ringing  agent willis here  jack

action and consequence  theirs is a world where nothing matters but their own needs  their own impossible appetites  and while the pleasure they derive from acts ofviolence  is clearly sexual  it also speaks to what wardenjackson called  their operatic devotion to each other  its a love affair i almost envy  a drug store was reported broken into right here  on the corner ofold forge road and

might learn something from the man  weve identified what sounds like light aircraft taking off  now washington county regional airport  falls within our area just south ofthe state line  since takeoffs are north to south  its a fair bet that our target area  iies along this fight path  for those ofyou who remember ninthgrade math  that gives usjust over three square miles to cover  roughly 1 000 households  with 1 00 law enforcement officials at our disposal  at about 30 households per man per hour  we should be able to canvass the area in three hours  agent bruskin will grid the target
