                speaking arabic  screams  military radio calls  radio static  loud hum  explosion  oh man  this is southern crescent to red crescent  weve got a downed plane at camp perimeter  thats a negative  we have nothing in the sky  we got something down here  advise medevac to stand by  were going to check it out  medevac one medevac one this is red crescent  southern crescent reports downed aircraft in their area over  breaker breaker this is quick light  anybody out there with their ears on  readin you loud and clear this is betty blue come on  from opryland its the grand ole opry  on wsm radio 650  brought toyou by goodys headache powder  when the nights been too long and the partys been too hearty  goodys headache powder will straighten you right out  and you have myword on that goody  loud static  cb caller 1  it was cigarshaped red and green lights  fast as hell  caller 2 i seen three ofthem fying over chester county  caller 3 right right six troopers were chasing them down 22  siren blaring  caller 4 i see one now its over the water tower  red and green lights just likeyou said  loud hum  from the truckers description the shape he fired upon  could conceivably have been a mountain lions  conceivably  the national weather service last night reported  atmospheric conditions in this area which were possibly  conducive to lightning  possibly  it is feasible that the truck was struck by lightning  creating the electrical failure  its feasible  and you know theres a marsh over there  those lights the driver saw may have been swamp gas  swamp gas  its a natural phenomenon in which phospine and methane  rising from decaying organic matter  ignite creating globes ofblue fame  happens to me when i eat dodger dogs  how can a dozen witnesses  including a squad ofpolice vehicles in three counties  become hysterical over swamp gas  ive investigated multiple sightings before  chesapeake bay the okoboji lakes  area 51 in nevada  none had this much supporting evidence  anecdotal data exhaust residue  radiation levels five times the norm  mulder none ofthat evidence is conclusive  the question is whywas the trucker singled out  isnt it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver  became swept up in the hysteria and fired upon hallucinations  after all the road can play tricks on you  yeah it can play tricks on you  but not like this  i started these stop watches at the same time  i dont know why theyre holding me  this firing a weapon on a county road charge  is a lot ofhorse manure  im a vet and i know how to handle a gun  mr ranheim id appreciate it ifyou could elaborate  on the reportyou filed last night regarding your encounter  it was round  iike a saucer  and green and orange lights  last nightyou said it was cigarshaped and black  i didnt ask for this to happen  coughs  all i want is to deliver my shipment ofauto parts and forget  coughing  pardon me for asking  but how long haveyou had that cough  why  im just concerned you said you were a veteran  whats that got to do with this  the cough the fever the rash  those are all symptoms ofgulfwar syndrome  i was never in the gulfwar  okay so how long haveyou not been yourself  since the thing last night  mr ranheim im police chief rivers  please forgive the misunderstanding  your trucks been squared away you may go  id like to examine the truck  that wont be necessary  this man had an alleged close encounter  the truck contains important evidence  sir lfl may  youve gotten all youre going to get  we will no longer cooperate in your investigation  why  just go away  not not here  its obvious someone got to the police chief  ranheim was hiding something  ranheim was sick  only since last night  excuse me could i useyour pen  mmhmm  you suggesting gulfwar syndrome is caused by ufos  ufos are frequentlywitnessed by soldiers during wartime  thanks  hereyou go  the only ufos that soldiers are likely to see  are secret military aircraft  what ifthats what made the soldiers in lraq sick  the exhaust or fuel ofa classified aircraft or its weapon  there is a base in little rock  you think thats what the air force was fying that night  theyd deny it but it could explain how ranheim developed his symptoms  possibly  i want to talk to some people when we get back to washington  the military isnt going to talk  no these guys are like an extreme government watchdog group  they publish a magazine called the lone gunman  some oftheir information is firstrate  covert actions classified weapons  some oftheir ideas are downright spooky  clicking  so mulder i had breakfast  with the guywho shot john f kennedy  is that so  yeah says he was dressed as a cop on the grassy knoll  mulder listen to this zhirinovsky the leader ofthe russian social democrats  hes being put into power  by the most heinous and evil force ofthe 20th century  barney  the cia  hmm  is this your skeptical partner  camera clicks  shes hot  you dont believe the cia threatened by a loss ofpower and funding  wouldnt dream ofhaving the old enemy back  i thinkyou give the government too much credit  the government cant control the deficit or manage crime  lone gunman  what makes you think they can plan and execute an elaborate conspiracy  she is hot  settle down frohike  its not idiots on the hill trying to bone capitol pages  were talking about a dark network  a government within a government controlling our every move  how can they do that  how ill showyou how you got a 20 bill  hmm  ill check  mmhmm  hey  thatsjust one method  they use this magnetic strip to trackyou  wheneveryou go through a metal detector at an airport  they know exactly how much youre carrying  it is a federal crime to deface money  the strip is an anticounterfeiting measure  on the inside other countries put it on the outside  o o okay all right  what doyou know about gulfwar syndrome  agent orange ofthe 90s  shells coated with depleted uranium  heard ofany classified planes being fown during the persian gulfwar  why expose secret planes to an air force that runs to lran wheneveryou fy  any ufo activity during that period  yeah ufos caused gulfwar syndrome thats a good one  thats whywe likeyou mulder your ideas are weirder than ours  scully those were the most paranoid people i have ever met  how could you think their ideas are remotely plausible  i think its remotely plausible that someone might thinkyoure hot  did you see the way they answered the telephone  they probably think every call they get is monitored  and theyre followed everywhere they go  its a form ofselfdelusion  it makes them think that what theyre doing  is important enough that somebodywould  whats the matter  phone ringing  hello  hanging up telephone  pitchers and catchers report for spring training this week  yeah what are we doing here  missed your calling did you mr mulder  maybe this yearwe can catch a game at camden yards  ofcourse we wouldnt be able to sit together  thats too bad  something tells meyoud have the connections to get great seats  any park in the country  camera clicks  itsjust a tourist  in our line nothing isjust what it seems  what am i onto  we go to investigate a truck drivers encounterwith a ufo  and the next thing were discovering electronic surveillance equipment  whos listening to us  whywontyou tell me  what am i onto  a dangerous path  man speaking arabic  responding ln arabic  screams  first man speaking excitedly  yelling response  the truck is bogus  and sos the truck driver ranheim  first i checked his manifest  it listed a truck carrying  weighing 31 00 pounds  then i checked with three weigh stations along his route  they have it listed at 51 00 pounds  theres something in that truck and its not auto parts  and ofcourse nobody ever reported him  furthermore ranheim lied about being in the gulfwar  his real name is frank druce  and i worked hard to get this one  he was special operations black beret  in mosul northern lraq  also he didnt get sick from the encounter the other night  hes been to the va hospital for treatments  three times in the pastyear  we had it  we had it and we let it go  four days ago an lraqi air force pilot  shot down an unidentified fying object  the wreckage and possibly the occupants were recovered by the army  ranheim the truck driver would be a perfect escort  for the wreckage andor bodies  out oflraq to a laboratory in the united states  that would explain why the truck weighs so much more than listed  the military has in the past  transported dangerous materials and weapons  in unmarked trucks across the country  im beginning to sound like those guys at the lone gunman right  where did you obtain this information  letsjust say its a source with a deep background  i want to know all about him  all i know is that hes guided us away from harm  how doyou know that  we work for the federal bureau of lnvestigation and were being bugged  what does that tell you  that tells me that not everything is as it appears to be  exactly  for all we know this deep background is responsible for the bug  hes never lied to me  i wont break that confidence  i trust him  mulder youre the only one i trust  then youre going to have to trust me  did you find out where the truck is now  generally  its heading west towards colorado  weve got to try to intercept it and see whats on board  im going to go pick up a few things  ill meetyou back atyour place in an hour okay  i cut the main breaker  sighs  you risk exposure coming here  what i have here is too important  the photograph in that envelope  was taken by an officer at fort benning georgia   is that where the lraqi wreckage is being held  are ufos monitoring the area  nice placeyou have here  wait wait  i just wanted to take this opportunity to thankyou  youve helped mywork so much  and youve never asked for anything in return  and i knowyouve putyourself at great risk to do so  this is the best photographic evidence i have ever seen  i knew the gulf breeze photos were a hoax  but this is the quality ofevidence the government has amassed for decades  at the highest classified levels  that business with the truckwas a decoy  to keep anyone looking closely away from fort benning  where they are keeping the remains ofthe lraqi ufo  weve got to leave for georgia immediately  this photograph is a fake  what  look  this soldiers shadow is allegedly created by the lights from the ufo  but it falls in a direction contradictory to the crafts position  there could be an offcamera light source creating that shadow  look closely at the color ofthe light refected in the windshield  it should be from the red lights ofthe ufo  but it doesnt match the color ofthe ships lights  theres probably tint in the windshield  or the gradation could be attributed to atmospheric conditions  we should have it analyzed  youre determined not to believe him  maybeyoure too determined to believe him  i am determined to follow a lead  that may result in the proofofthe existence  ofextraterrestrial biological entities  mulder listen please will youjust hear me  i have never met anyone  so passionate and dedicated to a beliefas you  its so intense that sometimes its blinding  but there are others who are watching you who know what i know  and whereas i can respect and admireyour passion  theywill use it againstyou  mulder the truth is out there but so are lies  thankyou  i had the photo analyzed by the bureaus computers  initially it appears to be legitimate  the film grain matches in pattern and density  color levels shading  then i noticed this  its the moon halffull  i had the refection in this window enlarged by 25  theres the moon again a quarter full  not to mention that the window couldnt even catch the moons refection  from that angle  you were right scully  its a fake  he tried to deceive us  now were alone on this  theres no one we can trust  theywent to a lot oftrouble to put us on the wrong track  theres something here that no ones supposed to find  why didntyou leave for fort benning  the photograph was a fake  well at leastyoure not insulting me further by feigning appalled surprise  i think a compliment is in order  that photo was prepared by ourvery best  i thoughtyou were my ally  oh i am  imagine if eisenhower told the allies ddaywould take place in belgium  i place my life in greatjeopardy every time we speak  ive been a participant in some ofthe most insidious lies  and witness to deeds that no crazed man could imagine  i spentyears watching you  from my uh lofty position  to know thatyou were the one i could trust   then why did you lie to me  to divertyou  you and scully are excellent investigators  and your motives arejust  however there still exist some secrets  which should remain secret  truths that people arejust not ready to know  who areyou to decide that for me  the worlds reaction to such knowledge would be far too dangerous  dangerous you mean in the sense ofoutrage  iike the reaction to the kennedy assassination or mias  or radiation experiments on terminal patients watergate  irancontra roswell the tuskegee experiments  where will it end  oh i guess it wont end as long as  men likeyou decide what is truth  that transcriptyou gave me ofthe lraqi pilot that was the truth  yeah  why did you even bother to show it to me  well i was aware thatyou were onto the truck  so i knew that down the road i would have to steeryou away  that i would have to lie toyou  and a lie mr mulder  is most convincingly hidden between two truths  mulder  ifa shark stops swimming it will die  dont stop swimming  im not responsible for the electronic surveillance  but i do know they can still hearyou  doorbell rings  scully mulder  areyou home  scully glad you dropped by  i been thinking about this whole situation  and i thinkyoure right  i thinkwe shouldjust move on  i think this time youre right mulder  all right stickwith him  hey  there is your roundtrip ticket to chicago  heres your credit card  and the plane departs at gate 35  id also like a oneway ticket to los angeles  with a stop in las vegas and ill be paying cash  horns honking  called everyweigh station and bureau office west ofcolorado  tied up an airphone for three hours  somejapanese businessman told me to stick a piece ofsushi  where the sun dont shine  my ears numb from being on hold for so many hours  at least they didnt trace our call  i couldnt find the truck did you have any luck  yep its heading northwest on l90  we have to get a couple oftickets to seattle  yeah think about it  this truck drove across america  people it passed probably thought it was hauling auto parts or furniture  iivestock whatever  nobodywould have suspected it was hauling a craft from anotherworld  here we go  mulder weve been following this truck for hours  maybe he knows were following him and hes taking an evasive route  well ifthat were the case  loud static  you all right  yeah  come on  scully ranheim  ranheim  scully  scully oh my god  it was an extraterrestrial biological entity alive  where did it go  i thinkwe werejust witness to a rescue mission  god mulder i cant stop shaking  whatjust happened does it fit the profile  areyou asking me ifit was real  did wejust have a close encounter  no it was another hoax  but how could anyone generate such force  whatever they used we probably havent heard ofit  sound weapons a stealth helicopter with an ultra highintensity light  it doesnt matter theres no evidence that this was a ufo  so they created this elaborate show just to defect us again  wouldnt it have been easier for them just  just to kill us  yeah ive wondered that myself  maybe theyre using me against myself likeyou said before  that i want so badly to believe  that idjust accept the obvious conclusions and walk away  well now we have nothing to go on  and no one to turn to  theres still one player in all this who hasnt lied to us  but its not quite someone we can turn to  leverling and priest rapids  east bank ofthe columbia river  did you send out a field investigator  and you can substantiate the sighting  okay nick thanks a lot  ive contacted several organizations that have hot lines for ufo reports  center for ufo studies in chicago  mufon nicap  none ofthem have ever reported a week ofsuch activity  it began in tennessee where ranheim was encountered  the sightings are following the path ofthe truck  and after last nights hoax  look at this  seven sightings in mattawa washington a hundred miles away  aliens  looks like theywant their colleague back  weve driven full circle through mattawa twice  theres nothing here  rock music  whats over there  man we have been waiting  welcome to our home  we are willing to go with you  freddie ahhdoonayvahsobarahgahs  thats an intergalactic space greeting  that means  hello space brothers   hello  whats going on here  a ufo party  youve seen ufos  last two nights theyre drawn to our electric power  they hover over the power plant down there  man everyone they are here  yes sir thats right  its all secure lock it up  mulder this is it  theres ranheim  this place has got to have the highest level ofsecurity  just the kind ofchallenge theyre looking for  who  dialing phone  phone ringing  lone gunman  its mulder turn the tape recorder off  okay its off   turn it off  its offalready  how would you like to have on your front page  the first substantiated photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity  no way an ebe what do we have to do  just hack me some identification numbers  mulder braidwood and stefoff  personal identification number    open the trunk please  park in lot four  thanks  hey wait  display these at all times  proceed  langly said he couldnt gain access to level six so thats whywe  we have to go back through that door  well look suspicious going back  well have to find another access then  theywont let us  you folks come with me please  were lost were looking for  just proceed down the hallway  ifyou couldjust help us  mulder stop  were agents with the federal bureau

themselves   mulder  stop  hold it  he took the stairs  go go go  this way  come on guys  aah  stay on top ofhim  move move  man halt  i said hold it  halt  guns cocking  deep throat let him go  let him go  youve done well  youre dismissed  i know how badly  how very badlyyou want to look through that window  but it would be pointless  its dead  after the roswell incident in 1 947  even at the brink ofthe cold war  there was an ultrasecret conference  attended by the united states the soviet union  the peoples republic ofchina britain  both germanies france  and it was agreed that should any extraterrestrial biological entity  survive a crash  the country that held that being would be responsible  for its extermination  i um have the distinction ofbeing one ofthree men  to have exterminated such a creature  i was with the cia in vietnam  a ufo was sighted for five nights over hanoi  the marines shot it down and brought it to us  maybe it didnt know what a gun was  or perhaps they dont show emotion  but that innocent and blank expression  as i pulled the trigger has haunted me  until i found you  thats why i come toyou mr mulder  and will continue to come toyou to  atone forwhat ive done  and maybe sometime  through you  the truth will be known  youre awfully quiet mr mulder  im wondering which lie to believe  chuckles
