he was so excitedhe wrote wow in the margins what was there a signal  30 times strongerthan galactic background noise it was on the 21cm frequency which nosatellite transmitters are allowed to use the signal was intermittentlike morse code and more importantly the signal seemed toturn itself on while in the telescopes beam the wow signal is the best evidenceof extraterrestrial intelligence but this this is better where did you get this maybe you can tell meis that from ohio state cant tell there are a few nickelanddimeseti projects around uc berkeley has one the planetary societyhas one at harvard and in argentina nasa was working out of goldstonein california and arecibo in puerto rico mulder this signal from 0630 tuesday the narrowband and matching of the antenna pattern indicates that it originatedfrom beyond lunar distance the same message is no jorge dont touch that red buttonnoho on the rojo thanks the same message is transmittedfour hours later on a wide band which puts its point of origin very closejust miles away from i send greetings on behalf ofthe people of our planet we step out of our  son ellos ya regresaron its just a tape machine jorge vmonos inmediatamente
