                screaming  god what areyou doing to barnett   excuse me  what areyou doing tojohnny  go back toyourward  theres nothing you can do foryour friend now  what  john barnetts dead  no i heard him screaming  i saidjohn barnett is dead  you understand  go on crandall get outta here  theres nothing more to see here you understand  what does this have to do with us  robbing ajewelry store is a federal crime  thankyou  i got a call from some guy i used to workwith  in the violent crime section  said it was important  chanting reggie reggie  mulder god i hate it when you do that  this is special agent scully  reggie purdue  how areyou  what happened here  lone gunman took out a salesgirl  after she filled up a bag for him  you guys turn up anything  not much  except  this  its going to blowyour mind  why  im telling you mulder  this is going to blowyour mind  what is it  wait a second  you see why i called you  what about witness descriptions  white male 51 1  to 6 ski mask  damn it reggie thats barnett  but it cant be  whos barnett  mulder it was my first case at the bureau  barnett was doing armedjobs all over dc  very trigger happy  killed seven people  there was this big task force  reggie was myasac  i was 28 right out ofthe academy  i had this theory on the case  reggie thought i was full ofit  what was the theory  that barnett had an inside connection  an employee at the armored car company  was tipping him off about large shipments ofcash  i was sort ofright  sort of  we planted bogus waybills  manifests with the armored car company to set a trap  but barnett was way ahead ofus  thats when the notes started   fox cant guard the chicken coop  clever huh  so you never caught him  no we did  we did but not uh not clean  an agent died because i screwed up  and what happened to barnett  he avoided the death penalty  but he went down for everyjob he did  consecutive terms 340 years  thejudge promised me he would die in prison  soyou think he escaped  no thatsjust it  he did die in prison fouryears ago  youre sure  i was paying attention  woman this guy a friend ofyours  mulder yeah i play golfwith him every sunday  what doyou think  youjust brought this in ten minutes ago  youre slipping henderson  ten minutes may be enough time foryou mulder  ofcourse i wouldnt know that  from personal experience  seriously what doyou think  okay first impressions  the ink is fresh  the note was written in the last 48 hours  ballpoint butyou knew that  a righthander  lets see  written by someone sitting down  but now im just showing off  yeah does it match barnett  id say its him  butyoure not sure   the writings sloppy  some ofthe ascenders and descenders are heavier  could it have been traced over a note of barnetts  could be but its a damn goodjob ifit is  thanks henderson i oweyou one  promises promises  purdue theres barnett  wed staked out an airport warehouse  but everything went to hell  when barnett took the driver ofthe armored truck hostage  wheres mulder  there coming around back  barnett doesnt see him  hes got a clear shot  yeah he should have taken it  but he couldnt  no not with a hostage so close  because its not by the book  it would have saved one life maybe two  bastard barnett just started blasting away  mulder did shoot barnett  twice in the shoulder and hand  but not before barnett killed the driver  and agent steve wallenberg  mulder never forgave himself for that  you should have heard his testimony  at barnetts trial  probably had a lot to do with barnetts sentence  ill never forget mulder  coming down from the witness stand  and barnett turning and saying hed get mulder  to tell you the truth  i wish mulder had killed barnett right there in the warehouse  what did henderson come up with   whats that  federal bureau of prisons  sent me a copy ofhis death certificate   name ofdeceased barnettjohn lrvin  cause ofdeath cardiac arrest  date september 1 6 1 989  it must be a clever copycat  the note was written in the last 48 hours  pull any prints  no prints  barnett had a lot oftime on his hands  maybe he planned it with someone on the outside  revenge from the grave that would be a neat trick  he planned to getyou didnt he  i wasjust down talking to agent purdue  and he showed you the videotape  you did the right thing mulder  did l steve wallenberg had a wife and two kids  one ofhis boys is an allstar on his football team now  i pulled that trigger two seconds earlier  and wallenberg would be here to see his kid play  instead ive got some dead man  robbingjewelry stores and sending me haikus  down set hup  lets go lets go now  fire it in there  yeah thats better  all right bring it back here  lets go  hustle it up line it up lets go  down  set hup  go go go go hard  applause  ill getyou you son ofa bitch  purdue ive been thinking about it mulder and i think  that somebody is messing with your head  barnett said hed get me you were there  hes dead mulder  apparently not  let me tell you something  there are a lot ofguys who know barnett made the threat  its barnett reggie  how can you say that  i just feel it  all this talk about spooky mulder  i never used to pay it much mind  i figured it wasjust talk about how paranoid you were  and now  remember the day you walked into my office  wet from quantico  you pissed me off just looking atyou  but then i saw howyour mind worked  howyou were always threejumps ahead  it was scary mulder  everybody said so  ive heard this story  well maybeyou ought to hear it again  you let a lot ofpeople down here in the bureau  they had big plans foryou  a lot ofpeople are saying  that spooky mulder has become an embarrassment  a liability  areyou saying somebody from the bureaus behind this  maybe maybe not  its always best to coveryour ass in any event  sorry  this wasjust faxed  its a copy ofjohn barnetts last will and testament  no surviving relatives  left what little he had to another prisoner  ajoe crandall and instructions  for his body to be cremated  his will was executed six months after his death  this document states that his ashes were spread  along the bank ofthe delaware river  by an employee ofthe crematory  used by the prison  its like i said somebodys messing with your head  killing a salesclerk just to leave me a note  id say thats going a little out ofyourway  mulder hes older now  he may have put on some weight  woman how much older  fiveyears  he could be wearing any kind ofdisguise  woman take us back to the day in question  was ityour impression agent mulder thatjohn barnett  took a kind ofa perverse pleasure in his crimes  didnt he send you notes to tauntyou  yes i felt  that he was daring us to catch him  that he killed his victims  almost as ifit were part ofa game  describe for the court ifyou would agent mulder  what happened when you finally caughtjohn barnett  we had a customs warehouse at the airport staked out  we knew that barnett had someone  working for the armored car transport  tipping him off about large cash shipments  but we never figured that he would actually be  inside the vehicle when it arrived  thats how barnett was able  to take the driver ofthe vehicle hostage  in otherwordsjohn barnett used his own accomplice  as a hostage  yes maam  and then what happened  we surrounded barnett  we ordered him to surrender his hostage  and his weapon  and where wereyou at this time agent mulder  i was right behind barnett  with a clear shot at the suspect  yes maam  butyou didnt fire why  its against fbi regulations  to unnecessarily endanger the life ofa hostage  and i thought  that with no means ofescape  barnett would give up  but what happened instead  the suspectjohn barnett  fired his weapon pointblank at his hostage  and then he turned his gun on steve wallenberg  shot him in the face  thankyou agent mulder  no further questions at this time  he gunned him down just for spite  judge the witness will step down  mulder heres a man with a wife and two small children  and you shot him  without hesitation  without conscience without an ounce ofhumanity  which is whyyou should die like an animal  you son ofa bitch  judge i will find you in contempt   people murmuring  order in the court  ifthere is not order in this court  i will be forced to clear the courtroom  man i ask that it be stricken from the record  judge duly noted  thejurywill disregard the witnesss last statement  whispers ill get you  ill need printouts ofeveryvariation  right  right  i just got offthe phone with the prison  what did they come up with  i called them on a hunch  barnett died ofa heart attack  at least thats what it says on his death certificate  i had them fax me all ofhis medical records  barnett was admitted to the prison infirmary  for an infection in his right hand  there isnt any indication ofcoronary complications  in fact on his physical six months earlier  he was given a clean bill ofhealth  crandall  someone to seeyou  i dont get manyvisitors  you knewjohn barnett  yes sir  how well did you know him  prettywell  he leftyou everything he had in his will  you must have known him better than prettywell  used to change his bandages and wejust got to  know each other  areyou aware that barnett died ofcardiac arrest  in this facility in 1 989  cardiac arrest where does it say that  on his death certificate  he aint dead is he  why doyou say that  last time i sawjohn barnett it was right in that room  over there  doctor took his bad hand clean off  what doctor  was it dr ridley  yeah it was dr ridley  thats the one  he told mejohnnywas dead  but uh i knew it was a lie  put a knife right up under my chinjust for asking  how could you tell barnett wasnt dead  i saw him looking at me  i saw him blink  ill never forget those eyes  what areyou going to do  i know what im not going to do  im not going to hang around and wait for barnett  to send me anothervalentine  you mean the ghost ofjohn barnett  i didnt knowyou believed in ghosts scully  phone ringing  hello  yeahjust a minute  its foryou  mulder  fox mulder  barnett  ill run a trace  you sound surprised  well you know shouldnt i be  you know its illegal to tape anothers phone call  without their express permission  isnt that what they call it  in some states  what makes you think im taping you  same thing makes me think  youre putting a trace on this call  what state areyou in  the same stateyou are  i stood next toyou in line for coffee this morning  i dont think so  man im everywhereyou are  everywhere  i own you  how do i know its reallyyou  what did i say toyou in the courtroom  did you ever doubt me  what did you tell me in the courtroom  ifyou thinkyoure going to keep me on this phone  with this clumsy act  by all accounts john barnett is a dead man  oh youre the dead man mulder  fine i just need confirmation  thatyou are whoyou sayyou are  you want confirmation  you got it  kisses  barnett you there  you lost him  yeah he was hip to the trace  was it barnett  john barnett was from new hampshire  he had a slight accent listen to this  fine i just need confirmation  thatyou are whoyou sayyou are  you want confirmation  you got it  kisses  what did he mean by that  i dont know but that isjohn barnett  im sure ofit  phone ringing  oh  yeah  reggie its mulder  mulder what doyou want  its the middle ofthe night  its only 1 045 reggie  yeah well i was sleeping  listen reggie it doesnt look like barnetts dead after all  now what  i got an inmate at the prison  who swears he saw barnett alive the night they say he died  mulder go home  get some rest  theresjust one thing that doesnt make sense  whats that  agent henderson said that note left at thejewelry store  was written by a righthander  yeah so  well this inmate at the prison  he swears he saw barnetts right hand amputated  gurgling  reggie you there  hey reggie  reggie whats going on  areyou there  what the hells going on  reggie what happened  hey reggie  reggie whats going on areyou there  what the hells going on reggie  hopeyou guys brought your finetooth comb  i want every piece oflint collected and analyzed  ifnothing turns up run it through again  mulder  his wife died ofcancer sixyears ago  never liked to talk about it  he was working on a mystery novel  he promised to show it to me once but he never did  i think he was afraid i wouldnt like it  im probably the only guy on the bureau  he trusted enough to even ask  im sorry  im just thinking how different things would have been  ifl would have taken that shot when i had it  were still not  fresh ink slightly smeared  i hate to tell you  and im not known to be wrong about these things  but this note was most certainlywritten  by a righthanded person  you see the pressure points inside the pen grooves  its a dead giveaway  would you be able to tell ifthis note was written  by somebody using a prosthetic hand  well this fellow  and im assuming from the cursive figures here  that it is a male suspect  he has a fairly nice fuid style  judging from the pressure variations  in the connectors  this person would need good finger dexterity  youre not going to get that with a prosthesis  soyou think its the same person that wrote the first note  uhhuh  this the guyyou think killed agent purdue  yeah  you know what occurred to me  you never got any prints offthose notes  ifthis guywas wearing a glove on his pen hand  the note wouldnt be smeared like it is  forwhat its worth  i wasjust trying to find you  listen to this according to the ama dr ridley  who signed barnetts death certificate  hasnt officially been a doctor since 1 979  what doyou mean  his membership expired and wasnt renewed  after maryland revoked his medical license  for research malpractice and misuse ofa government grant  where does it say that  in the federal journal  for the national lnstitute of health  what kind ofresearch  he was conducting experiments on young children  afficted with a disease called progeria  man the patientyou see is an eightyearold girl  suffering from the advanced stages ofprogeria  she looks about 90  only about 1 00 cases have ever been reported  so the disease is rare  but fatal  some progeria patients make it to early adulthood  but others become terminal at age seven or eight  whats the cause ofdeath  clinically its cardiac  or cerebral vascular disease  but actually  these poor kids die ofold age  is that dr ridley  yes in 1 974  joe ridley thought  that he could take their accelerated aging  and slow it down  initially  some ofhis lab work was promising  but then things got out ofcontrol  he wanted to begin human trials  whywasnt he allowed to  because he hadnt met the criteria  it was all too hypothetical too dangerous  i mean  i knewjoe ridley  he didnt care about those kids  he talked about them as iftheywere laboratory animals  this terrible disease progeria  he saw it as a wonderful opportunity  he used those exact words with me once  an opportunity to unlock all the secrets  when they refused to allow the human trials  he became enraged  doyou know what they called joe ridley behind his back  what  doktor mengele  so how did dr ridley  eventually lose his medical license  he went ahead  with the human trials secretly  on an outpatient basis  when we learned about it ofcourse  we terminated his grant  and filed charges with the state medical boards  im afraid your colleague dr ridley  has dropped off the face ofthe earth  yeah  although its rumored he went to south america  to continue his work  scully you dontjust reverse aging  ridleys found a way  listen to whatyoure saying  he wanted human research subjects right  prisoners likejohn barnett  its science fiction  what would you have said  about gene splicing dna fingerprinting  cloning artificial intelligence  maybe were not looking for a man in his late 40s  maybejohn barnett has found the perfect disguise  youth  mulder i want to age him backwards now  lets start with ten years  now fiveyears more  and add 20 pounds  a healthy 20 pounds  scully ridleys notes from the human trials at nih  indicate he didnt see aging as inevitable  but as an opportunistic disease  a disease that could be prevented reversed even  by changing the chemical cues that trigger certain genes  however there is no evidence whatsoever  that ridleys work yielded any results  or that his theories all hope to the contrary  hold anyvalidity  creaking  according to the leading scientificjournals  projections on this kind ofgenetic engineering  are at best speculative and futuristic  knocking  knocking  who is it  drjoe ridley  ifyoure drjoseph ridley  where haveyou been for the past fiveyears  i originally continued my research in mexico  but for the last threeyears  i spent my time in central america  in belize to be exact  what about barnett  john barnett  is the only patient left  the only one who survived the experiments  what aboutyou  my appearance is deceiving  i have no more than a month to live  as i am dying from a rare cerebral vascular disease  the same disease  that kills the kids suffering from progeria  thats right  an unfortunate side effect ofthe treatment  by using the genetic components ofprogeria  i was able to reverse the aging process  the same way the disease expedited it  at the same time i and my patients  became genetically susceptible  to the same ailments  a child ofsix or eight would  ifhe had the disease  what about barnett  john barnett  ifl didnt so personally detest the man  i might call him my one triumph  barnetts not dying  only his eyes which for some reason  do not respond to the gene therapy  otherwisejohn barnett appears to be thriving  but how  i varied barnetts treatment  once i isolated the progeria receptors  i stumbled on something quite unexpected  this same genes related to the production ofmyelin  the material that insulates neurons in the body  yes  you see myelin is not present in the veryyoung  and by reversing the effects ofaging  i found with barnett  i was able to regulate the production ofmyelin  myelin being the material  that prohibits you or i from say  regenerating a new hand  ifwe were to have ours cut off  you were able to growjohn barnett a new hand  not exactly  not a human hand anyway  i could never get the cells to divide or behave properly  im afraid to ask  what kind ofhand did you grow  there had been some successful work  done in london  by taking samples ofwhat we call cell morphegins  from an amputated salamander arm  and applying them to the back ofthe creature  theywere able to grow a new limb  on a different part ofthe body  but only on salamanders  untiijohn barnett  yeah  unbelievable  mywork has cost me dearly  im an outcast in the medical community  i was called dr mengele dr frankenstein  but i didnt care  becauseyou knew that ifyour theories panned out  the man who owns the fountain ofyouth controls the world  when the ama censured me  certain sponsors came out ofthe woodwork  one ofthem was the us government  they financed your research  you might be more surprised to learn  just how high up the ladder this dirty little secret goes  i know whyyouve contacted me  listen and ill explain  i am not proud ofthe way in which this matterwas handled  but like it or not john barnett is a fact oflife  i wish agent purdue were around to appreciate the irony  the government knew full well  that barnett was in the country  you ofcourse know  that barnett stole all of ridleys research  well what ridley doesnt know  is that our government is bargaining with barnett  to buy it from him  what does he want  a lot ofmoney immunity safe haven  will he get it  laughing  he holds all the cards  youre aware that this freak ofscience  youre negotiating with is a murderer  the information he has  could change the course ofmankind  consider the options  i will  phone ringing  ringing  hi this is dana scully  please leave a message after the tone  beeps  electronic voice retrieving messages  hi dana its mom i just wanted to call and say hi  give me a call whenever  okay hon byebye  hi dana its cathy  i hopeyoure going to meet me before my cello recital  whats that  its my private answering machine  at least it used to be  this morning i heard someone  dialing in my private code and replaying my messages  last night before dr ridley arrived  i could have sworn someone was in my apartment  when ridley knocked  i thought id mistaken the noise for him  this morning i took this down to prints  john barnetts left index oblique  is on the underside ofthis unit  phone rings  mulder  moaning  barnett  groaning  your new friend ridley  dont grow too fond ofhim huh  hes going to die soon like the rest ofyour friends  the rest ofmy friends  one by one  youre not that smart  chuckles  tell me youre not going to make me  prove it toyou again areyou  oh well no matter  it will beyour turn soon enough  well you wont get that chance  oh no  laughs  whos going to stop me huh  man this is this is the land ofthe free  well im just checking in  bye  for now  what does barnett know aboutyour phone messages  uh that my mother called for no reason  and im meeting a friend before her cello recital  wheres that  mulder before the performance and during  were working at a disadvantage  because we dont know exactly what barnett looks like  study each ofthese faces  know them particularly the eyes  im including a diagram ofthe theater  you have six front entrances and four more backstage  we know that ifhe shows hell be keying on scully  so wherever she is she should not leaveyour sight  weve got two hours before the performance  know this place inside and out  we dont want any shots fired ifwe can help it  we want to take barnett alive okay  howyou feeling  its the first time ive ever played the target  lets make sure its not the last time  instruments being tuned  gun  down  check her out  stay back mulder  shut up  back off back off  dont even think about it  just let her go  go ahead and shoot  go ahead man  shoot mulder  what areyou afraid of huh  what its against regulations huh  no man  you need me alive dontyou  cause im the one with the research huh  so i could shoot her  and youjust have to live with it dontyou huh  shut up  how about it mulder  woman please  barnett just like old times huh  huh  gunshot  screaming  call an ambulance  man its okay scully an ambulance is on the way  easy you all right  dont try to move  where are they  can you hear me barnett  where did you hide them  all shouting  how areyou feeling  like somebody kicked me in the ribs  that bullet went through eight layers of kevlar  youre lucky to be alive  what about him  they few in three specialists to try to save his life  that guy in the ugly suit is probably cia  hes been trying to talk to him  is barnett conscious  yeah but hes not talking  mulder i know whatyou did wasnt by the book  tells you a lot about the book doesnt it  barnett  come on  where are the papers come on  technician ten vitals dropping  barnett  heart monitor even tone  were gonna hit him  all shouting  shock him now  woman its readywhen you need it  man stand clear  woman hes going fast  scully they lost him  bastard will take that research with him to the grave  where doyou think it is  mulder who knows  if barnett didnt destroy it he couldve stashed it anywhere  which would have a certain cruel irony wouldnt it  scientific knowledge that could change the course ofmankind  buried out in a field somewhere  or sitting in some safe deposit box  getting old just like the rest ofus  scully lfhe didnt destroy it chances are  that somehow someday somebodywill find it  ticking  mulder and when they do  maybe he didnt get his revenge from beyond the grave  but somehow i feel like  we havent heard the last fromjohn barnett  ticking
