                 loudrumbling   the kids  boy mom mom mom  kevin   yelling    kevinscreaming   mom rubys gone  ruby  ruby  ruby  ruby  ruby  blevins agentmulders latest302  requesting assignment and travel expenses  for the both ofyou  sioux city lowa  thats the first lve heard ofit  lt came up through channels  from mulders asac to the district g1 4  and onto my desk  l dont understand  ln essence mulder is petitioning the bureau  to assign a case number  to a tabloid headline  he must have more evidence than  not according to his 302  l admit that is strange  even for mulder  perhaps it has something to do with this  take a look  an x file  has he shared any ofthis with you  theres no need to protect him  hes the agent ofrecord he initiated the file himself  she was his sister  she disappeared 21 years ago  he was 1 2 and she was eight  he claims that he was in the room when it happened  he recalls a bright light outside the window  and uh and a presence in the room  ln your opinion  has agent mulders personal agenda  clouded his professional judgment  ln my opinion no  butyou can see how it might appear that way  as you know  agent mulders preoccupation with fringe matters  has been a big source offriction in the bureau  this is another case in point  lm going to disallow the 302  with respect sir  at least let me talkwith him  and make a recommendation  ltjust doesnt seem  substantial enough to warrant an investigation  okay scully so we disagree  lts not the first time and it wont be the last  at least ifwe had a legitimate source  this is the essence ofscience  you ask an impertinent question  and youre on yourway to a pertinent answer  what makes this case any more credible  than the hundredyearold mother with the lizard baby  because the lizard baby  wasnt born anywhere near lake okobogee   okowhat  bogee  okobogee  ls that supposed to mean something to me  lfyou know anything about trout fishing  or ufo hot spots  define hot spot  four sightings in 1 967 august  including one by a national weather service plane  this is a lightblasted digitally enhanced enlargement  the pilot took that photograph  try a girl scout with an lnstamatic  four ofthe nine girls in the troop claim to have seen something  five ifyou include the den mother  the air force said it was a weather balloon caught in a wind shear  but there wasnt a weather balloon  launched that day within 700 miles  read me the names of those girl scouts from 1 967  lisa terrel bonnie winston doreen mccallister darlene mor  lts the same darlene morris  ms darlene morris  lm agent scully and this is agent fox mulder  we talked with you on the phone last night  please come in  well l knew that ifl screamed loud and long enough  that someone would listen  but l never expected the fbl  uh this is kevin  kevin say hi  would you like some coffee  mmm  some days l cant even  get myselfup out ofbed  and kevin has been acting so strange  l dont know what to do anymore  l just want her back again  ms morris  during the divorce was there a custody battle  charles had nothing to do with this  how can you be so sure  because l know what happened  ltsjust like it was before  summer of 1 967 the girl scout troop   how did you know  your names on record  at the center for ufo studies in evanston lllinois  really  yeah a pilot for the national weather service  made a sighting over the same area on the same day  they took her didnt they mr mulder  you said that kevin was there the night it happened  he didnt see anything he was asleep  doyou think l might talk to him anyway   mmm  thanks  you know  lve told the story so many times now  oh to the newspapers and the police  and every time l tell it  people get this look in their eye  just like the look  thatyouve got right now  hey buddy  you mind ifl sit down  thanks  your mom tells me youve been having nightmares  l guess so   you want to tell me about them  no  all right  what areyou doing  you making something  can l take a look at it  thanks  lts coming from there  the tv  l dont know what it is may be a binary sequence ofsome kind  could be anything could be nothing  l knowyoure busy look l know a friend  who knows a friend who knows a friend  who can getyou a ticket to a redskins game  you got it all right  you know where to find me thanks danny  as l was telling your partner we found no evidence ofkidnap  no phone call no ransom note  and since we didnt turn up a body  you assumed she ran away  well it wouldnt be the first time ruby morris ran away from home  how doyou explain what her mother saw  l think that darlene has a very active imagination  lve been listening to those stories since the first grade  so basically you ignored her statement  l included it in my report  butyou didnt bother to check it out  we went out to the campsite we didnt find anything  darlenes little girl was no prom queen  l cant count the number oftimes l pulled her out ofparked cars  or found her puking her guts out by the side ofthe road  lt wasjust a matter oftime before  before what  before something bad happened to her  and if darlene needs to make up crazy stories to get past that fine  but dont tell me to treat it as the truth  lm not going to waste my time  l just think its a good idea  not to antagonize local law enforcement  who me lm mr congeniality  you never know we might need his help one ofthese days  lll send him a bundt cake  youre looking for ruby right  thats right who areyou  lt doesnt matter  areyou a friend of rubys  ruby didnt have friends  shejust had people she liked to hang with  and she liked to hang out with you  l guess we had some times  like the night she disappeared  lt was greg she was supposed to see him that night  whos greg  her boyfriend greg randall  theywere supposed to meet up at the lake  they had stuffto talk about  what kind ofstuff  greg got ruby pregnant  l dont know whatever she got herselfpregnant  doyou know what they were planning to do about it  theywere going to leave town at least thats what ruby told me  you know greg from school  greg school  l dont think so  all he ever did since we met him  was pour beer at the pennsylvania pub  excuse me   doyou know where we could find greg randall  whos asking  what kind oftroubles he got himselfinto now  actually we were hoping you could tell us  greg called in sick three weeks ago man  l havent seen or heard from him since  any ideas where he might have gone  no but ifyou find him tell him hes fired  this is the hotel well be staying at ifyou hear ofanything  thats a nice tattoo what is that  whats it look like  a fying saucer  you dont really believe in that stuff doyou  l take ityou dont  no l think its all just a bunch ofcrazy people  howling at the moon  so you havent been out to lake okobogee haveyou  no l havent why  you should ride with us sometime  you might see some things that will changeyour mind  get a killer sunburn in the middle ofthe night  wheres mulder  where did you get the document  lfyou explain whatyoure talking about maybe l can helpyou out  this is a document  just looks like a bunch ofones and zeroes to me   tell me whereyou got it  tell me what it is  keep playing games  lll haul your ass up in front ofthe d6  you can explain to them whatyoure doing obstructingjustice  lts your call holtzman  unless they tell me otherwise  lm not accountable to anybody outside my subcommittee  l dont care ifits the nsa or the vatican police  lts a defense satellite transmission  youre kidding  just a fragment but highly classified  we need to know where it came from  well sure lll letyou know as soon as l find out  thats it mulder  youjust boughtyourself a oneway back to washington  we got it  great  what  you shouldnt have told them they have nojurisdiction  mulder theyre nsa  they think the boy may be a threat to national security  how can an eightyearold boy who can barely multiply  be a threat to national security  people call me paranoid  how did kevin obtain topsecret information  where doyou think he got it from  lts okay baby dont worry   lt will be okay  agent come with me son  mom  lt will be all right baby  you guys do really delicate work   lets get this to cryptography  lets go  thinkwe got what we needed thankyou  what is it  lm not sure  we scanned all 77 pages through the mainframe  and none ofthe information is actionable  other than the satellite transmission  nothing can be construed as a security risk  the boys being released this afternoon  so it wasjust a random set ofones and zeroes  on the contrary there was nothing random about it  l dont understand  all information can be rendered digitally  in a series ofones and zeroes  when we downloaded the data we found an amazing range  well see foryourself  da vincis universalman  a dna double helix  theres lots more   classicalmusic playing    thats from the brandenberg concertos  but theyrejust fragments  a few notes here and there  some lines from the koran a shakespearian sonnet  almost like someone switching channels huh   mrs morris  l have nothing to say toyou  mrs morris please give me a minute to explain  would you pleasejust wait right over there for mama  lll be right there  l thoughtyou were both here to help us  scully this has been a terrible mistake  and l assureyou that the government  will pay for all damages  l dont wantyour money l want my daughter back  and l wantyou to leave us alone  butyour son has seen something  you stay away from me and you stay away from my child  come on honey  lts okay lets go now  l thought we were headed back into town  where are we going  the boys the key scully l know it  the key to what  finding ruby  think about it for a minute  this is a boywho is receiving digitized data  from a television screen  agent atsumi said it was a statistical aberration   no  okay l admit its not much ofan explanation  kevin is a conduit ofsome kind  a conduit  a link or a connection to whoever  orwhatever took ruby that night  but how  lfthere was an abduction  its likely that kevin was touched in some way  mulder l know whatyoure thinking  l know why this is so important toyou  l know  but there is no evidence indicating an abduction  thats whywere going to lake okobogee  according to the police photos  ruby and kevin were sleeping right here  just a stones throw from the forest wall  meaning what  meaning anybody could have come out ofthe forest to grab her  haveyou noticed the tree line  evidence ofextreme heat  or an electrical storm  besides which theres nothing  to connect it to the night of rubys disappearance  thats true  doyou think a lightning strike could have caused this  doyou have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass   something was out here scully  something hot enough to turn sand into glass  to singe those trees  and to blister the roof ofthat camper   whispering  mulder  look  what is it  lts a grave  shallow by the smell ofit  mulder what areyou doing  mulder you are disturbing a crime scene  stop  what ifits her  l need to know  you okay mulder  lm fine  looks like a male caucasian  sir  victims name was greg randall  rubys boyfriend  ruby had a lot ofboyfriends  beforeyou put that away can l look at it  go right ahead  look at that  thats her the girl from the library  who  we didnt get her name but she claimed greg and ruby had run offtogether  doc fowlers a buddy ofmine  delivered both my kids  l can find out who had that appointment  scully have a seat tessa  we know thatyou lied to us the other day  we know thatyou had the appointment  with dr fowler on august 7  we know thatyoure the one thats pregnant not ruby  you dont know nothing doyou  we can prove it tessa  and we can prove that greg was the father  so what ifhe was the father  this is very serious  doyou understand how serious this is  now youve waived the right to an attorney  so ifyou lie to us here today  you could be charged with perjury  he promised me wed be in la by christmas  he had a friend there  and ld never seen the ocean  you said that he and ruby were seeing each other  you said that theywere planning to meet at the lake  ls that true  l was nowhere near the lake that night okay  sureyou were tessa  you knew theywere meeting soyou sat there and you waited for them  you were angry and you werejealous   l wasnt  you sat there and you waited  when they showed you killed him first lsnt that how it went   no  you snuck up from behind him and you shot him in the back  bam  and then you killed ruby bam  what was she doing right before she died tessa  was she pleading for her life  was she running away   l didnt kill her  wheres she buried   l dont know  you dont know where you buried her tessa   l didnt kill her  you didnt  she wasnt even there that night  well how would you know that tessa  ifyou werent thereyourself  mulder youre not seeing the whole picture   which is  ln all likelihood ruby is dead  ls thatyour conclusion or the conclusion  ofthe sioux city sheriffs department  theyre searching the national park  and a rescue dive team is coming in from des moines to drag the lake  theyre wasting their time  doyou really thinktessa sears is telling the truth  why not what if ruby never did show up that night  she lied to us in the library and about her pregnancy  what makes you think she wouldnt lie to us about killing ruby  because something was out there in those woods  we have a suspect in custody  we have a confession to one murder  and we have a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another  lts over mulder  lts time to go home and turn this over to local law enforcement  l cant do that   mulder where areyou going  to talk to the boy  darlene wont even letyou in the door  well lve got to see him  they dont want to have anything to do with us  stop running afteryour sister  this wont bring her back  come with me or dont come with me  but until they find a body lm not giving up on that girl    knocking   hello  mrs morris  kevin   teapot whistling   mulder  what does it mean  l dont know  lm going to check upstairs  oh my god  what is it  just come up here  look  lts her lts ruby  this is a long shot they could be anywhere  you know when l was a kid  l had this ritual  ld close my eyes before l walked into my room  because l thought that one day when l opened them my sisterwould be there  just lying in bed like nothing ever happened  you know lm still walking into that room  every day ofmy life  scully  darlene

here l know it  kevin l dont think she is  l know how much you wanted it to be her   l did too  scully mulder  come on  scully  ruby  shes unconscious but shes still alive  lll get help  the nurse says shes been awake for almost an hour  any ideas what caused the coma  theres no sign ofhead trauma  no narcotic traces or electrolyte abnormalities  except herwhite blood cell count was skyhigh  was there a reduction in the lymphocyte population  or release ofglucocorticoids  um  actually both  how did you know that  theyre symptoms ofprolonged weightlessness  shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances  hi ruby  who areyou  were with the fbl  lm special agent dana scully and this is fox mulder  my mom said you might be coming by  how areyou feeling   sighing   fine l guess  where were you ruby  can you tell us  kevin lts okay ruby  he knows  lm not supposed to tell  they told me not to say  who told you  ruby who told you  darlene sweetheart  you dont have to say anything  youre right  we should wait till ruby gets a little stronger  could we speak outside for a moment  l think that its best that we put all ofthis behind us  hasnt ruby been through enough already  l know how disoriented she must seem right now  but in a couple ofweeks maybe even a few days  l dont want her talking toyou or anyone  she should be encouraged to tell her story  lts important thatyou let her  lmportant to who  l have my daughter back l dont want any more trouble  besides she hardly remembers anything  she will remember one day even ifits only in dreams  and when she does shes going to need to talk about it  like l did  listen to me all ofmy life  l have been ridiculed for speaking my mind  but it was the truth darlene  the truth has caused me nothing but heartache  l dont want the same thing for her  lt doesnt have to be that way for ruby  as far as lm concerned  she spent the last month on the back ofa harleydavidson  ls that whatyoure going to tell kevin  lm sorry  werber butyour eyes are open  mulder yeah theyre open  but its like nothings happening  try turning your head  l cant  why not  l dont know  l cant move  so l dont  l just lie there in bed  can you seeyour sister  no but l can hear her  what is she saying  shes calling my name  over and over again  shes crying out for help  but l cant help her  l cant move  areyou scared  l know l should be but lm not  doyou know why  because ofthe voice   the voice  the voice in my head  whats it telling you  not to be afraid  lts telling me that no harm will come to her  and that one day shell return  doyou believe the voice  doyou believe the voice  l want to believe
