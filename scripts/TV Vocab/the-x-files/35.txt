this definitely isnt mine no this is michelle charters shes a nurse at a convalescent homein worcester massachusetts  what happened to her according to miss charters she was raped the abrasions would be consistent withher claims as would be the medical report which cites the kind of injuryassociated with sexual trauma  whered you get this violent crimes no the woman made the video herself no one will believe her story why not because she claims to have been rapedby an invisible entity a spirit being i have xfiles that document similar cases  i know ive been going through them none of them have ever been substantiated  not surprisingly given the emotional violence of rape the face of the attackeris often erased from memory that he could be perceived as invisibleis a logical leap from there  yes but this case is different why she has filed a lawsuitagainst the government she seems to be certainwho the spirit being is mr arden  hal arden and you know him hes been a patient where i workfor about five years the facts of your case seem to contravenethose of other cases we have right you mean the otherwoman raped by invisible man cases how do you know it was himwho attacked you he made advances toward me and he said things rude things when you bathe somebody every day you get to know more about themthan you really need to an old man smells a certain way and he feels a certain way  i know this is hard for you no this is the easy part hard is not getting leaveor workmans comp and having to go backto work with this guy to continue our investigation weregonna need some evidence physical or yeah yeah yeah i know ive heard it unless you have hair or semen or fibresor whatever you guys cant build a case thats right look i didnt make this up ok i was attacked and im not a shrinking violet who wouldrepress the memory of a rapists face if i could positively id him or give yousomething to incriminate the man i would you gotta be kidding me what do i think about her claims huh i should be in the guinness record book im 74 years old ive got plumbingolder than this building hm and it dont work much better either thank you for sharing are you aware yourenamed in a lawsuit against the government  i am did you ever threaten miss charters  what did you ever threaten miss charters threaten it was harmlessfor cryin out loud ever since this sexharassment fadmen cant say whats on their minds  she says you made advances hm advances if i told you you were a pretty woman andi would like to show you some affection would you be offended oh i didnt mean to step on your toes there sir there seems to be some confusion here yeah i thought nurse whatshernamesaid she was rogered by a ghost i may have one foot in the grave buti cant fly down hallways spreading amore apparently not if thats what its like if thats what its like in heaven lord take me now  what do you think mulder about his plumbing  about his story i think this is gonna be a waste of time like all the other xfiles on entity rape unsubstantiated phenomena but in a substantiated crime hey pay attention or youll takeanother bath with your clothes on at five and a half bucks an houri dont give a

is a setback a setback hal was part of a group of patientsive been treating for 11 months  but alzheimers isnt treatable its an experimental drug called depranil that increases acetylcholine in the brain ive read that the clinical benefitsare marginal at best well yes but these patients show cognitive abilitieswell beyond anything thats been reported so he was actually getting better before he started receiving the drughe could hardly complete a sentence look its not muchto get excited about my work most of these peopleare on the downhill slide if i can make them comfortablemaybe prolong a life its all they expect but to reverse an illness would it be possible for us to seeother patients in your test group  sure if you want to yeah  whered you get that aw it was hals since hes not here

this is fantastic whats going on here leo its incredible youve got an asian orderly working herewhats his name  uh gung i think do you know where he is somewhere down in the basement upshaw you must believe me i didnt kill him  but its your mushroom crop isnt it yes  who else would have buried him there why were you growing them for medicinal purposes were you feeding them to the residents yes but only in small amounts why because it makes them feel better  it makes them feel better or it kills them no exactly what kind of mushrooms are they its from my prefecture in my countrytheyve been used for centuries for what purpose in my country our customs are different youre not in your country now youre hired here to care forthese people under our guidelines where i come frommany generations live under one roof as children our grandparents live with uswe feel a duty to take care of them it isnt like that in this country we respect our old peopleas we respect our ancestors we dont send them away to dielike stan and hal  these people get excellent medical care but theyre not treated with respect hals family never came to visit him once and the orderlies treat the residentsworse than dogs no one is mistreated here  you are not here to see all right gung who killed the orderly who buried him in that room something has gone very wrong the mushrooms we take to speak with thedead to see our ancestors in the spirit world but the spirit in this place is very angry and the souls that died herecontinue to suffer and now they have been awakened are you saying that a spiritkilled this man upshaw yes theyve taken revenge for their mistreatment how are the mushrooms taken dried mixed with many herbsmade into powder we should make surenobody else takes them you check on the other patientsgung come with me lets go come in please someones taken them all  i think youre right about whats been happening here is a result of themedication but not the doctors medication mushrooms arent medication theyre goodon burgers but they dont raise the dead shamans have been using them for centuriesto gain entrance to the spirit world youve been readingtoo much carlos castaneda all right ask any anthropologist then i know a shaman gets intoxicated he hasdreams or hallucinations and interprets them i dont think its any more magical than that i dont know how else to explainwhats happening here well i think these mushroomsare a poison to the system and thats what killed hal arden and raped michelle charters and killed thosetwo orderlies somethings been unleashed i dont know how to explain itbut it has something to do with those pills daddy daddy what are you taking what are you putting in your mouth go away you go away go away go away you leave
