pathologist yes  can i ask what yourpreliminary findings are um seconddegree burnson the face contusions about the neckbruised larynx if i had to listcause of death at this pointid have to say asphyxiation were you expectingsomething else you havent runa toxicological yet  they should be finished shortly id be interested to see what you find  when will it be on file later this morning id like a copyas soon as possible please well im sorry youll have to gothrough regular military channels what do you meanmilitary  youre not fbi quanticos under military jurisdiction there wasnt an fbi pathologistavailable this morning skinners expecting my reporton the duane barry incidentwhat do i tell him  the truth what do you mean confirm mulders version of eventsyouve earned his trust  the object now is to preserve it for how much longer until your assignmentis completed  if mulders such a threatwhy not eliminate him thats not policy its not after what you had me do kill mulder and you risk turningone mans religion into a crusade what about scully  weve taken care of that how we tell you onlywhat you need to know  i think i have a right to know you have no rights only orders to be carried out if you have a problem with thatwell make other arrangements victim appears to have expiredfrom prolonged hypoxemia secondary to asphyxiation of several possible etiologiesthe most likely is strangulation due to the presence of contusionsand a bruised larynx do you want to speak to thisagent mulder i didnt kill himif thats what youre suggesting  but you attacked him i was interrogating himabout agent scully he wasnt cooperatingso i pushed him and you lost control momentarilybut then i left the room he was very much alive i spoke to himagent krycek spoke to him agent krycek says he entered the roombecause the suspect was gagging is agent krycek assertingthat i killed him too no he corroboratesyour story but the fact is weve gota dead suspect agent mulder and no other plausiblecause of death opc wants the both of youto take a lie detector testyou are to report there immediately there is anotherplausible cause of death which is poisoning by injectionor ingestion  poisoning you wont find that onthe navy pathologists report what are you sayingagent mulder that the autopsy is incompletethat the military covered upthe toxicological findings  and why would they do that because they know where scully is  why are you so paranoid mulder oh i dont know maybe its because i find ithard to trust anybody alex alex can iborrow your car keys  why where are you going theres somebody i gotta see  but were scheduled at opc i know just give me the keys please  thanks you wasted a tripmr mulder  theres nothing the senatorcan do for you now what  not without committingpolitical suicide why do they have something on him they have somethingon everyone mr mulder the question iswhen theyll use it  i need his help no one can help you now your channels of appealand recourse are closed your predecessorcould have helped me you know dont you you know whats happened to her this reaches beyond any of usmr mulder even my predecessor i want an answer why kill duane barryif there was nothing to hide you mean the government there are no answersfor you mr mulder they only have one policy deny everything this is a serious allegationagent mulder only so far as it is true agent krycek was hiredor suborned by an outside agency to impede a federal investigationand may be responsible for the death of a suspectin a capital murder case it goes on and the possible murder of the tramoperator at skyland mountain theres a lot of bloodon this document agent mulder  are you standing behind thisgoing on the record yes sir well then youd damn wellbetter have the facts to back it up  i need to see agent krycekimmediately i cant protect youagent mulder past a point thisll becomea larger bureau matter all rightwhat do you got i found thisin agent kryceks car he doesnt smoke agent krycek was the last personwith duane barry befrore he died he was also the last person to seethe tram operator before he disappeared when i got to the topof skyland mountain i saw an unmarked helicopterworking the area i believe that agent krycekgave away the where abouts of duane barry and agent scullyto whoever hes working with  and who is that i dont know the military some covert organizationwithin the government whoever it is that the manwho smokes those cigarettes works for  why because agent scully got too close to whatever it istheyre trying to deny because she hadhard and damning evidence that metallic implantin her possession or becauseher termination would prevent further involvementwith me and my work do you thinkagent scullys dead i dont know how far do you think theyd go what do you knowabout agent krycek  i didnt give himthe assignment i only yes thank you agent krycek didnt show upfor work this morning his home numberhas been disconnected thats it hes gone  he just disappears into the wood work so it would appear who are these peoplewho can murder with impunityand we cant do anything about it  let it go agent mulder like hell  theres nothing you can do what can you do about it theres only one thingthat i can do agent mulder as of right nowim reopening the xfiles thats what they fear the most agent mulderthank you for calling me im sorry i donthave better news do you know somethingis dana okay i dont knowanything more about it i know youre doingall you can i had that dream again last nightabout dana being taken away i cant tell youhow
