                thunder pealing  animal howling  neighing mooing  animal roaring outside  growling  screams  growls yells  im not a killer  i never meant to hurt no one  im tired ofmy cattle being butchered  thats the fourth one this month  who orwhat doyou thinkwas responsible  that cow looked like a piece ofpaper  that went through a shredder  no animal could do that  then areyou saying that a person  was responsible for this  i want to remind you mr parker is free on bond  pending trial  hes willfully speaking  solely in regards to this incident  and not about other litigation  we cant talk about mr parkers case  against the trego lndian reservation  thats exactlywhat i mean  wait a second  this aint the time for lawyer crap  i want to get this in the open  you think i killed an lndian  because were having an argument about where my land ends  we want to settle in court  joseph goodensnake is dead with a wound from your shotgun  all im saying it was no animal i know of  but it damn well didnt seem human neither  take a look at my boys scars  it was dark  we heard a growl we went out to protect the cattle  i could have swore i saw red eyes and fangs  i thought my boy lyle was  look nobodynobody  was more shocked and upset than i was  to find out it was thatyoung lndian boy  but ifhe killed our cattle  im very sorry that we had to find out about it that way  but as far as im concerned thats the end ofit  can we see the corral  ill takeyou out there  agent mulder  yeah  agent scully  i suppose ifl were hearing our side ofthe story  it might not hold up too well  parts i dont understand myself  things my father could never try to explain to a stranger  what kinds ofthings  for the last few months  wheneverwed go outside at night to check the cattle  we never saw anything out ofthe ordinary  not a mountain lion not a coyote  not even anytregoes agent scully  but i can feel it  something not human  out there  watching me  the airwas more still  the night animals more quiet  it was like nature herself was terrified  gave me the creeps  the creeps  yeah the creeps  dontyou ever get the creeps  the victim was shot there  about three meters from where parker fired  theres no way he could have mistaken a person for an animal  its openandshut mulder  you know im surprised you volunteered  for this assignment  any bureau agent could have investigated this reservation homicide  why areyou interested  well there seems to be nothing unexplainable  about this case  nope  not a thing  this is so odd  its almost like a snakeskin thats been shed  i suspect the parkers knowingly killed goodensnake  they hardly seem the type to skin theirvictim  police and coroners report make no mention ofsuch an act  scully well have to look at the body ourselves  mulder the bodys been transferred to reservation authorities  were supposed to get in touch  with a sherifftskany  excuse me were not from around here  were looking for sherifftskany  anyone know charleytskany  man go home fbi  how did you know  i could smell you a mile away  well they told me that even though my deodorants made for a woman  its strong enough for a man  i was at wounded knee in 1 973  what i learned fighting the fbi is  you dont believe in us and we dont believe in you  i want to believe  whyyou here what areyou looking for  you know what were looking for  you tell me what i know  were looking for information  on the homicide ofjoe goodensnake  were looking for anything  that can create human tracks in one step  and animal tracks in the next  parker he found whatyoure looking for  he killed whatyoure looking for fbi  parker and his kid killed my brother  youre all too afraid ofsome stupid lndian legend  to do anything  gwen  the suits come when theywant something  but when we need help  theyre nowhere to be found  sherifftskany  im agent scully and this is agent mulder  goodensnakes body is in my office  bill tom  let them through  come on boys let them through  who are they  guardians ofthe dead  they escort the deceased spirits to the new world  i let them as far as the front door  i keep ancient beliefs out there and police work in here  the woman in the pool hall  said people were afraid ofsome legend  what do they believe happened  im not a park ranger  here to answer questions about lndians  whenever i need federal help i never get it  since this case falls  under thejurisdiction ofthe fbi  youre entitled to examine the body  so lets get it overwith  mulder was the woman in the pool hall his sister  gwen she andjoe are primarily responsible  for fueling the boundary dispute with parker  they felt he had been grazing his cattle  farther and father onto the reservation  parker probably told you it was his idea to settle in court  joe and gwen filed the suit  take a look at that scar tissue  looks like he had been attacked by an animal as well  tskany couldjoe have been attacked also  maybe the parkers did see an animal  no those wounds  have been healing for quite some time  the shotgun wound indicates pointblank range  the pellets entered the body in a single mass  the assailant couldnt have been more than three feet away  we need to take a look at goodensnakes dental records  these are the canine cuspids theyre normal  could his records have been switched  the second incisor is chipped  just like the ones in his mouth  these match joe goodensnakes  there are cases ofcalcium phosphate salts  developing abnormally with age but  that could account forwhatjim parker claims to have seen  he was out that night  expecting to see a mountain lion  he gets rattled and the fashlight beam catchesjoe here  parker saw what he wanted to see an animal  lyle has scars just likejoe  doyou have a facility for an autopsy  why  ifjoes teeth are abnormal an autopsy might reveal  abnormalities in the interior ofhis anatomy  i cant allow that  im fully qualified  no the funeral is tonight  its a cremation after that well have nothing  tregoes believe that the recent dead are unsettled  by their new condition as spirits  any desecration ofthe body angers the spirit  and keeps it haunting this world  a law enforcement officer cant destroy evidence  dont tell me what i cant do  native americans believe  there are laws greater than that ofthe us government  iftheywant joe at rest  thats the way its going to be  ifyou want to make  an issue out ofit with your authorities  go right ahead  charley doyou believe  that the spirit ofjoe goodensnake  is in that room  all i know is  tomorrow the day after youre going to leave  but i have to stay here  ive got to answer to these people  you can continue your investigation  youre going to have to do it withoutjoe goodensnakes body  man chanting  scully since weve been here youve acted  as ifyou expected to find every piece ofevidence  weve come across  what arent you telling me  why are we here  a true piece ofhistory scully  the very first xfile  initiated by j edgar hoover himselfin 1 946  during world war il  a series ofmurders occurred in and around the northwest  seven here in browning alone  each victim was basically ripped to shreds  and eaten as ifby a wild animal  however many ofthe victims were found at home  as ifthey allowed their killer to enter  in 1 946 police cornered what they believed to be  such an animal in a cabin in glacier national park  they shot it  but when theywent in to retrieve the carcass  they found only the body of richard watkins  sounds like the parker scenario  the murders stopped thatyear  because the cases were unsolved and so bizarre  hoover locked them away  hoping that people around here would forget about them  this file indicates that they started again in 1 954  and 59 64 78 and now again in 94  but  here it comes  these animalman related murders  predate the oldest xfile by 1 50 years  members ofthe lewis and clark expedition  wrote oflndian men who could change their shape into that ofa wolf  what this folder describes is called lycanthropy  its a type ofinsanity  in which an individual believes  that he can turn into a wolf  i mean no one can physically change into an animal  how can youjust dismiss the evidence  the tracks in the mud the shredded skin  a man with the teeth ofan animal  even ifyoure right  andjoe goodensnake did somehow have the ability  to transform physically into an animal  hes dead jim parker shot him  in a couple ofmoments his bodywill be burned  end ofmystery  lets hope so  you dont belong here  gwen  youre around to wrap upyour investigation  i just wanted to say im sorry aboutyour brother  i feel sad for anyone who loses a part oftheir family  a part  he was mywhole family  im it now  as a demonstration ofsorrow  im supposed to give away  all my brothers possessions  gwen i dont know what to say  its no big deal  he had more possessions than he had friends  i read the report ofyour investigation  into the goodensnake homicide  it was very good it was thorough professional  but what i want to know is offthe record  what doyou think really happened  your explanation agent mulder  is lying on that burial platform  why dontyoujust accept that and go home  charley doyou believe in shapeshifting  this is a funeral  drums beating  man chanting  group chanting  chanting  chanting continues   get out  i want to show my respects  i dont wantyour respects  i wantyour heart to grow cold  i wantyou to feel what im feeling  i thinkyou better leave mr parker  i wish your brother could be here  i wish that more than anything else  faint growl  clinking  growling  by the way the bodys been mutilated  id say hes been attacked by a large predator  or somebodywanted it to look that way  doyou think this is retaliation  for the death ofjoe goodensnake  i dont know  haveyou talked to gwen goodensnake  she seemed pretty upset last night  shes gone nobody has seen her since the funeral  ive put an apb out on her  and what about lyle parker  we cant find him either  he could be dead as well  ill take a look around  growling  growls  scully gasping  thats not from any animal ive ever seen  sheriff i think its time we had a talk  an exchange ofideas  scully mulder  im taking lyle to the hospital  hes suffering from exposure  when hes been checked out im gonna question him  what areyou hiding  i thought it was over  over  is that whyyou wouldnt allow an autopsy  onjoe goodensnakes body  you thought it would all end when he was cremated  what wereyou afraid wed find  i cant tell you  but ill takeyou to somebodywho can  im ashamed to say it  afterwhat happened at the funeral  i picked up some bourbon  and i dont remember a thing after that  sometimes when im down  i go out to where me and my dad keep stray animals  that wander in on the ranch  i just watch them you know keeps things in perspective  anyway  my mom when she was alive  was the one that started keeping those animals  i guess i go out there and think about her too  god i must have been reallywasted  to run around there naked  you must have thought i was one ofthose animals  when you did go home did you talk toyour father  no hed have been mad i even went to the funeral  i i have an image ofhim  sitting on the front porch  but i dont remember talking to him why  your father is dead  im sorry  sighing  it appears as ifhes been  attacked by an animal but  i suspect it may be homicide  lyle i lost my father recently  and i know how overwhelming  was it my fault  by going to the funeral  did it anger them into killing my father  i dont know  i can deal with death  you know living on the ranch being close to nature and all  you see how it all works things are born things die  everything else falls in between  but ifl caused it  ifl brought it on  i couldnt uh  i i  i saw it once with my own eyes  it was a long time ago  it seemed like a dream  i was a boy  was that 1 946  the watkins case  i sense youre different fbi  youre more open to native american belief  than some native americans  you even have an lndian name fox  you should be  running fox or sneaky fox  just as long as its not spooky fox  tell me lsh what did you see  watkins had been attacked by an animal  when he was alone in the woods  his scars healed it was forgotten  then the murders began  the tregoes  we realized that watkins had been attacked  bywhat the algonquins call the manitou  an evil spirit capable ofchanging a man into a beast  to be attacked by a manitou causes the victim to become one  the healed scars onjoe goodensnakes body  the manitou overtakes a man by night not by full moon  but when its blood lust builds to uncontrollable level  the man changes to a sickening creature  it kills releasing a savage energy  the man returns to his true self  unaware ofwhat has happened  the cycle begins anew the next day  this continues until death  one night  when i was 1 6 years old  i was coming back from fishing in the cut bank creek  i knew a shortcut behind watkins house  there was a a groan  not animal but not human  i looked into his window  he was covered in sweat and blood  he was in a great great pain  his arm the skin ripped  it tore up and fell to the foor  claws sprang from his fingernails  he turned screaming  and he saw me  his eyes his eyes were still human  they begged me to kill him  and ifl had been hunting and had my gun  id have done it without a second thought  but being a boy and scared to death  i ran away  shortly after the police killed him  but the manitou rose again  eightyears later  but with watkins dead  how could there have been an attack by a manitou  watkins had a son  it could be passed along bloodlines  gwen  ifjoe goodensnake was this creature  then perhaps it didnt originate in him by the first attack  but was handed down through the bloodlines  gwen could have it also gwen could have killed parker  low metallic clank  engine starting  gwen  no no no  charley youre under arrest for stealing lshs car  what happened what areyou running from  i saw it  i saw it kill parker  let her up  i went there after the funeral  i was going to mess up the kid  so i waited  parkerwas on the porch  then this thing this animal  oh my god  sobbing  ive never been so scared  i ran and i hid in the woods all day  i wanted to get out  i wanted to get out
