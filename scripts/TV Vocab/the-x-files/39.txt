                your turn jack honey are you still feeling sick whats the matter with youcant you hear the baby is crying how about some cereal honey you were having those awfuldreams again last night i didnt sleep long enough to be dreaming i want you to go to the doctorfind out whats wrong  will you do that id just like to eat my breakfast in peace do you think thats possible jack what is it private john mcalpinone of the few the proud but dead he wrapped his car around a treehe died on impact drug and alcohol tests came back negative the car shows no evidenceof mechanical failure the military is calling it a suicideits the second one in as many weeks  both at the same base yeah except its not exactly a base the marines were stationed at thefolkstone processing center north carolina more than 12000 refugees waitingfor asylum from uncle sam  wasnt there a riot there a month ago yeah a tenyearold boy was killed  details of his death were never released why did the military contact us they didnt mrs mcalpincontacted the bureau when the military refused to investigateher husbands death further she doesnt believe it was suicide there this is the tree that stoppedprivate mcalpins car the state police reportedthere was graffiti on the bark looks like some kind of ritual symbol most of the refugees at folkstone are haitian mrs mcalpin believes voodoowas behind her husbands death mrs mcalpin doesnt believe her husbandkilled himself she wants to know who did jack used to tell these jokes well they were pretty dumb i guess but the way he told themalways made me laugh then he got transferred to the campand nothing was very funny any more did he ever discuss what went on therewhat his duties included no hed just come home angry mostly at himself though sometimeshed turn it on luke and me was he ever treated for depression or stress no i tried getting him to talkto someone even our minister but jack believed in dealingwith his own problems did he believe in voodoo the marines his family and footballsums up everything jack believed in so when did you first think that his deathinvolved something out of the ordinary one of the boys in his squadtold me what they found at the accident and he said it was somekind of voodoo curse the same one they found on the stoolthat puerto rican boy used to hang himself  who told you that harry dunham hes from new orleans so hessuperstitious about that type of thing what about you my husband had just died so i didntgive it much thought either way not until luke dug this up out of hissandbox i know it sounds crazyme worrying about all this the truth is im scared im scared for my child and i just dont know what to do any more its down there on the right sir man speaks haitian va tu va tu go go go awayget out of here go go away go go hes crazy too much rum for such a pretty ladyit is dangerous out here you need something pour vous garder for protection  your lucky charm come on mulder  how much five i mean ten ill give you five  ok lets go mulder you should always carry protectionthere you go im still not clear just what it isyoure investigating here two of your men have died in two weeksallegedly of selfinflicted injuries ive taken every measureto see it doesnt happen again ive even flown in the 528th combat stresscontrol detachment from camp lejeune but your soldiers arent in combat what were dealing with here is worse how so were soldiers were not prison guards were policing a hostilepopulation of foreigners without the resources to feed or housethem there are bound to be some conflicts so your men bear the bruntof the refugees frustration its hatred plain and simple they hate us and all i can do is see that theyreprocessed as efficiently as possible colonel wharton a uh certain ritual signwas found at the scene of both deaths  is there anything you can tell us about that not much apparently its some sort of voodoo marking but you havent investigated itas a possibility possibility of what all i know is voodoo causeda riot in my camp one night they held some secret ceremonythe next day all hell broke loose we understand a refugeewas killed a young boy no one felt that tragedy more deeply than me i was able to isolate the one responsiblefor instigating all the trouble  who would that be his name is bauvais pierre bauvais  thinks hes some kind of revolutionary do you think we could speak with him if you dont mind listening tohis laundry list of complaints id also like to examine private mcalpinsbody i have a signed consent from his wife private dunham will help you bothwith whatever you need cause of death was no great mysterythat boy was doing 60 when he hit the tree  so they pronounced him at the scene his head was hanging like a broken peony and he had no cardiac functioning i saw no reason to conduct an autopsy thenand i still dont you can see for yourself what kind of a sick joke is this jackson who the hells been in here someones tampered with mcalpinsbody and i wanna know who  youre harry dunham yes sir you knew private mcalpin his wife said you were friends we were in the same squad any idea why he mightve killed himself i cant say sir cant say or you wont say ill be right here if you need me my name is mulder im with the fbi i was hoping you could answer questionsabout the marines who took their own lives it is a terrible shame im not convinced its as simple as that you do not believe i wasinvolved in this do you how could i be when they keep me locked up in here you tell me these photographs were takenat the sites of both deaths the shell was found buried underone of the soldiers homes can you tell me about the symbol why what do you expect to learn from this just the truth one of the marines left behind a wifeshes too frightened to even mourn she deserves some peace of mind it is the locomiroir the crossroads between the two worlds the mirror in which a manmust confront his true self these marines maybe they did not like what they saw colonel wharton says youincited the riot last month my country was born on the blood of slaves freedom is our most sacred legacy does that mean youd kill to preserve it wharton will not let us return home which is all we ask mulder i need to speak with you shes come to tell you the marine is gone  how did you know its the spirits loa have warned you somebody stole mcalpins bodyand replaced it with a dogs corpse they will only warn you once after that no magic can save you come on scully lets go what do you think happenedto private mcalpin bauvais mustve switched the bodies  but hes been confined for the last month then he had somebody else do it you said there was no evidenceand securitys impossible to breach whoever did it was clever and thorough i wasnt suggesting thatsome kind of spirit did it well just in casei believe in covering my bases mulder voodoo only worksby instilling fear in its believers you saw how bauvais tried to intimidate me ill admit the power of suggestionis considerable but this is no more magicthan a pair of fuzzy dice scully look out hey private mcalpin hes nonverbal nonresponsiveto voice touch or pain the neurologists suspect he suffered asevere concussion resulting in amnesia a plausible diagnosis only im moreinterested in how he came back to life well obviously he never left dr foyle made a gross mistakewhen he signed the death certificate  did you get a copy of the blood test yeah electrolytes white and redcounts are all normal except this is strange the lab detected trace levelsof tetrodotoxin in his blood thats a poison found in the reproductiveorgans of puffer fish a japanese delicacy only i get the feeling that private mcalpindidnt frequent many sushi bars  you have a theory how it got in his blood what do you know about zombies i hope you dont tell robin mcalpinthat she married one in 1982 a harvard ethnobotanistnamed wade davis did extensive field research in haition the zombification phenomenon he analysed several samples of zombiepowder prepared by voodoo priests  he found tetrodotoxin in all of them mulder its a lethal poison small doses can depress cardiorespiratoryactivities to such a low level that the victim appears clinically dead  zombie or not jack mcalpin is alive exactly which is what makes me wonder about theother marine who allegedly killed himself why would they bury private guttierez here they beat you to it youre the fbi arent ya yeah weve arranged to exhumethe body of manuel guttierez i prepared the dig as soon asi got the order but its too late  too late yeah the body snatchers got there first i caught em a few times right in the actbut its gettin i cant keep up any more thats uh why i got this dont the police intervene they got their hands fulljust tryin to protect the living im all these people haveto preserve their rest these body snatcherswhat do they do with the bodies  they sell em to who well it varies when the local medicalschool ran short of cadavers rumour had it that thesnatchers got 200 a head but mostly its the voodootypes who do the buying a lot of folks in these parts go in for that with the medicines and the potions and here we are look at that they dug him upright under my nose hows he supposed to rest in peace like this they can do what they likewith the pigs and the chickens but this is a desecration this is uncool mulder look at that see what im talking about let us take care of this knock yourselves out hey let me be i didnt do nothingwhat did i do  maybe you can tell us let me be maybe i should kiss a fewand find out if one is guttierez fresh bones they pay good but i go there for the frogsyou find the best frogs at the cemetery how do you get out of the camp i go and then i come back what about your parentsare your parents at the camp what about a name chester bonaparte  what do you do with the frogs chester for each one i catch i get 50 cents  from who who pays you for them bauvais his magic is the most strong he even made my fries disappear you know chester i got magic tooand i bet i can make your fries reappear merci mulder certain frog species secretea substance called bufotoxin its chemically similar to whatwas in private mcalpins blood we should ask bauvais whathes doing with those frogs i didnt want to say anythingbut i think were being followed theres a grey fourdoor sedanin the parking lot keep an eye on chester out of the car private  youve been following us i had to warn you you didnt seem interested before i couldnt talk then not withcolonel wharton so close by and not with him right there chester hes just a little boy no sir he is not  whats going on he was about to tell us why were in danger youre putting yourselves intosomething you dont understand but you do bauvais warned him he told the colonelhed take his men one by one unless unless what unless the colonel let his peoplego back to haiti but the colonel he just had us turn up the heaton all them beatings  colonel wharton sanctioned beatings he ordered it and worse the things he is making usdo to those people why hasnt anybody filed a complaint none of us feel good about it maambut you dont join the marines to feel good you said bauvais threatenedthe colonels men he said hed take their souls and you believe he can do that jack was my friendlook what happened to him we dont know what happened to him butthere is an explanation for his condition back home an associate ofmy daddys clyde jessamin once crossed a man onsome kind of realestate deal jessamins daughter took ill with somethinthe doctors couldnt make heads or tails of all they could do was shoot her fullof morphine the pain was so bad she died five minutes pastmidnight on her weddin day and when they did an autopsyto try and figure it out all they could find was a bunch of snakessquirming around inside her belly  sounds like an old wives tale no maam its not you see lm the one who was supposed to marry her  think hes telling the truth until i can figure out why hed lie yeah hes superstitious and superstitionbreeds fear its what voodoo is all about its as irrational as avoidinga crack in the sidewalk why would he be trying to avoid chester chester chester wait a second chester stop im not gonna hurt you chester its ok ill get him chester chester can i get you anything else sir just get the door  im sorry im having my breakfast thats all right we already ate i understand you obtained a court orderyesterday to exhume private guttierez thats right ive filed a complaint withthe justice department his body was missingstolen from his coffin apparently now you see what were facing here what barbaric religionwould desecrate a grave we suspect it was an act of retaliation retaliation  for your mistreatment of the detainees what the hell are you talkin about physical abuse of political refugees is aprosecutable crime under international law its bauvais isnt it hes the oneyoure gettin this garbage from look nobody ever said this was a hotelbut its hardly a concentration camp  then there is no policy of harassment its my men who are being harassed the un the relief organisations theyre all so busy protecting the rights ofrefugees nobodys looking out for my men well well let you finishdont want your breakfast to get cold whartons left these people no choice but tofight back with the only weapon they have theres a big difference betweennasty looks and raising the dead not according to private dunham agh what more scare tactics  let me see that oh
