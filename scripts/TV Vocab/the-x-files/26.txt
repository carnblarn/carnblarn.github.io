very sorry to interruptbut agent mulder is demanding to see you  is there a problem agent mulder yeah there is then make an appointment thats hard when youreup to your ass in raw sewage on another meaningless assignment  excuse me whats next scrubbing bathroom floors  youre out of line agent mulder so i gathered fine come into my office agent mulder please would you inform the room as to why you regard your casein new jersey as meaningless its a simple drugland body dump not the type of casethe fbi wastes time or manpower on given your recent history youre not oneto judge what is or is not a waste of time  sir my work on the xfiles the xfiles have been closed agent mulder you will carry out new assignments and investigate them to the bestof your ability is that not clear yeah and ill be anticipating your field reportson your current homicide case thank you is this seat taken no but i should warn youim experiencing violent impulses well im armed so ill take my chances i hear you really endeared yourselfto assistant director skinner today sometimes its hard to smile when theyask you to bend down and grab your ankles its not as if youve ever triedto fit into the programme no no ive been thinking a lot about that lately  ive been thinking about leaving the bureau what would you do pursue my work in theparanormal somehow you could request a transfer to quanticocome back to the behavioural science unit they dont want us working together scully and thats the only reasoni can think of to stay what about this case youre working on  its a zero wheres the body in our forensics lablook i know what youre trying to do maybe i can request to do the autopsy its an exercise skinner is justrubbing my nose in this one theres nothing to it theres a dead body isnt there oh examination and autopsy ofjohn doe number 101356 case number dp112148 special agent fox mulder field investigator body is an adult male withadvanced tissue decomposition weighing 165 pounds in extremis 69 inches in length intact skin is mottled and discoloured due to submergence in and exposure toa highly bacterial environment cause and time of death unknown possible identifying mark on right forearm body cavities appear normal interior organs intact consistent in rate of decomposition removing the ribcage condition of heart and lungs are good no sign of thrombinatural or degenerate

god im gonna get help im gonna give you a tetanus boosterjust as a precaution id be happy if you just give me somethingto get this taste out of my mouth let me take a look ah  any trouble swallowing uhuh itll go away  agent mulder yeah newark pd referred me to youim surprised the fbi is involved  is there something here i should know i dont know maybe you can tell me hes a sanitation worker he claims he wasattacked by something down in the sewer  attacked by what weve been unable to determine i thought it was a bogus disability claimbut he appears to be telling the truth  whats his condition hes in satisfactory health ive given him a heavy course of antibioticsand were checking for hepatitis he does have a strange wound on his back  what kind of wound it could be some kind of bacterial infection frankly i cant sayive ever seen anything like it  this is agent mulder of the fbi any idea what attacked you  ive been thinking it mightve been a python a python or a boa constrictor somebody probablyflushed their pet snake down the toilet we found an alligator in the sewera couple of years ago stronger than hell ill tell you thatclamped onto me like a vice it almost looks like a bite excuse me  mulder mulder its me i need to see you ive got something you should know about  what is it some kind of parasite in your john doe i should know more by the time you get here im in jersey i should be takingthe shuttle in about an hour can i get outta here id like to go home excuse me  scully this is a bad time for me to talk mr mulder yeah i think you should knowyou have a friend at the fbi who is this agent mulder if you dont have any morequestions im gonna release this man ok go ahead close the door its called turbellaria commonlyknown as a fluke or flatworm this was living inside the body it had attached itself to the bile ductand was feeding off the liver lovely believe it or not some 40 millionpeople are infected worldwide this isnt where you tell mesome terrible story about sushi is it maybe youd rather hear what youcan catch from a nice rare steak so what the murder weaponwas a top sirloin flukes are endemic in unsanitary conditions its more likely that the victimcontracted it down inside the sewer  before or after he died i dont know my sources say its unlikelya single parasite could have killed him he was a young man but the weird thing istheres no other discernible cause of death how do these parasites attach themselves they have whats called a scolexa suckerlike mouth with four hooking spikes  anything like this whered you get that something attacked a workmanin a new jersey sewer this morning  and youre asking me if this is from a fluke could it be the scolex is a tiny organthis is a huge bite mark  how big can these things get mulder i im sorry it felt like old times there for a second flatworms are what are knownas obligate endoparasites they live inside of the host entering the body throughthe ingestion of larvae or eggs they are not creatures thatgo around attacking people thats good i didnt wanna tell skinner his murder suspect wasa giant bloodsucking worm no well at the very least thisll be interestingto the newark department of sanitation look i dont know who you sharedour conversation with the other night but id prefer it if you didnttry to launch a campaign for me  excuse me i dont know who you talked to  i didnt talk to anybody somebody told me i had a friend at the fbi look mulder i i dont know what to saybut i i wouldnt betray a confidence the city runs on different systems some new some builtat the turn of the century  almost as old as charlie right charlie oh yes sir  what part of the sewer was i in an older section big eightfoot tunnels it looked more like a catacombthan a sewer line the new sections are concrete pipemostly 24 inches and all the sewagecomes through this plant have you ever seen one of these it looks like a big old worm its called a fluke it camefrom the body in the sewer wouldnt surprise me no telling whats beenbreeding down there in the last 100 years ray here charlie slow down im backflushing the system its in there  what is it i dont know it just swam right past me there it is turbellarian flatworms are carnivorousscavengers less than 3cm in length found in fresh and sea waterthey are hermaphroditic with complex reproductive systemscapable of internal fertilisation many species require more thanone host to complete a life cycle although the wound on the sanitation workersuggests scolex attachment the sheer size of the wound precludesinvolvement of the common fluke worm  scully scully its me  you know that fluke you caught yeah it mustve been the runt of the litter i dont see it there it is tucked away in thefar corner behind the pipes  oh my god i dont know if you can see but it has no sex organs its genderless platyhelminthes are often hermaphroditic mulder this is amazing its vestigial features seem parasiticbut it has primate physiology  where did it come from i dont know but ill have to tell skinner that his suspectis a giant bloodsucking worm after all all were missing is the identityof the body in the sewer he was a russianan engineer on a cargo freighter he had a tattoo on his forearm i didntmake the connection until i detected that that was the name dmitrispelled in cyrillic lettering how did you make the connection at all somebody shoved this under my door i guess you really dohave a friend in the fbi and mulder when you see skinnerto hand in your field report i know that its your decisionbut i hope that you know that id consider it more thana professional loss if you decided to leave everything looks in order is something wrong agent mulder thats an unexpected responseconsidering the bizarre nature of the case and of the suspect the strangeness of the criminaland the crime are not lost on me i had my reaction to them in a conversationabout how to process the suspect this meeting is to evaluate your work theres no way youll prosecute this the justice department wants the suspecttransferred to a psychiatric institution this is not a man its a monsteryou cant put it in an institution what do you do with it agent mulderput it in a zoo it killed two people two the sanitation worker who was attacked wasfound dead at home as a result of his injuries you know you had a pair of agentsthat couldve handled a case like this agent scully and i mightve been ableto save his life but you shut us down i know this should have been an xfile we all take our ordersfrom someone agent mulder thatll be all youre secure this is vehicle 4940 requestingimmediate backup and assistance roger 4940  what have you got a dead marshal and an escaped prisoner other than that bupkis we got a police line in a twomile radius watch any access to the sewer systemits gonna try to get back underground  mulder mr mulder ill make this brief success in your currentassignment is imperative  who am i speaking to are you hearing me mr mulder yes why is it imperative reinstatement of the xfilesmust be undeniable  canine unit sixfour copy sixfour copy were at a campsite a quartermile from youthe dogs tracked a scent to a chemical toilet  i looked inside but its empty the tanker  hold on sixfour what if hes on the tanker truck the company that owns the truckdoesnt keep detailed service records they had five trucks out this morningthree of them have deposited their loads  so he could have been here and gone if he hasnt he will be  and every tanker dumps its load here its a state law  everythings processed through this plant yep  then what it empties through an outlet pipe about five miles out to sea  could it have escaped through that pipe doubtful the systems full of filters nothing biggerthan your little fingers gonna get through if its here its going to be trapped here i guess all we can do is wait  mulder its me where are you the treatment plant i thought itmight be back in the system  how forget it its stupid  well you wont like what i have to tell you why not it hadnt occurred to me but the fluke in thecorpse might have been an incubating larva this creature or whatever it istransmits its eggs or larvae through its bite  you mean its trying to reproduce its looking for hosts it attacks because the victims bodiesprovide generative nourishment  mulder yeah  if it finds a new host i know it could multiply agent mulder linesman spottingsomething down in a section of pipe where  here thats near where we found the first body right except this isan old overflow system that dumps into the harbourduring heavy rainfall that must be where it got into the system its working its way back out to sea thats the overflow pipe it leadsto another vault like this one then about three quartersof a mile to the sea lets see if we can get that gate closed its rusted in position lets see if i can get some leverage here agh hey  goddammit you all right yeah i i lost my glasses  give me your hand get me outta here grab it we need some help down here ill get you outta here hold on hold on are you all right are you ok  is this seat taken no but i should warn youi may reek a bit of the sewer ill take my chances you talked to skinner yesterday success in our work is imperative scully reinstatement of the xfilesmust be undeniable  that came from skinner no we have a friend in the fbi i thought you might be interested in the labresults on the biology of the fluke larva dissection and analysis indicates reproductive and physiologicalcrosstraiting resulting in a sort ofquasivertebrate human human yes but still capable of spontaneousregeneration like any fluke or flatworm how does that happen radiation abnormal cell fusion the suppression of naturalgenetic processes mulder nature didnt make this thing we did i know these these are from chernobyl that creature came off of adecommissioned russian freighter that was used in the disposal ofsalvage material from the meltdown it was born in a in a primordialsoup of radioactive sewage you know they say three speciesdisappear off the planet every day you wonder how many new onesare being created i made this
