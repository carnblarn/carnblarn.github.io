mean according to the literature literature you know the waythe hair and nails are cut away sorta like they do in cattle mutilations i hate to disappoint you agent bocks but it doesnt look like the work of aliens no how can you be sure ive seen this kind of thingbefore at violent crimes whoever dug this upprobably used a backhoe if you check the ground youll probablyfind new tracks leading to a garage nearby  you think he may work here but its unlikely hes probably worked at a mortuaryor cemetery at some time probably been bustedbut you wont find any record it has to be bad for businesswhen those kind of stories get around youre sayingsome humans been doing this yeah if you wanna call him that  you ok scully yeah ive read about cases of desecratingthe dead but never seen it nothing can prepare you for itits almost unimaginable  why do they do it well people collect salt and pepper shakers fetishists collect dead thingsfingernailsand hair no one quite knows why though ive never really understoodsalt and pepper shakers myself  sometimes you surprise me mulder whys that how that didnt shock you back there id prepared myself for itbefore we left washington you knew this wasnt ufo relatedfrom the start id suspected as much yeah it took us three hours to get hereour plane doesnt leave until tomorrow  if you suspected vikings versus redskins scully you and me have you lived inthe twin cities area long mr pfaster i grew up here i was away for a few years oh what kind of workwere you in before cosmetology hair and makeup oh its interesting if you dont mind my sayingthats a lovely colour lipstick youre wearing is that indian summer yes yes it is youre applying for the jobas the delivery man to put myself through schoolive gone back to school oh and what are you studying  comparative religions oh  are you a religious person yourself yes very i shouldnt say this but mr ficicello feelsvery strongly about religious backgrounds he prides himselfon the honesty of his employees can you put that on the application  ill attach a little note thank you long long passheres garner with the catch and garner brought down at the washingtonfiveyard line for a viking first down sorry you had to miss your gamebut weve found more bodies dug up did you get your forensics reporton the first one yet there was somebody down in the grave cut the hair with a pair of pinking shearsgotta wonder about this guy well at least he wasnt down therewith his blowdryer  how many bodies does that make three in the last two days what else can you tell me about the corpses the hair was cut from the headsof two of the bodies from the thirdthe fingernails were pulled out with what looks likea pair of needlenosed pliers i want you to draftan eyesonly memo to everyone here and to all law enforcementagencies in the area saying what that the twin cities may have aescalating fetishist on their hands  a what an escalating fetishist security should be tightenedaround cemeteries and funeral homes hospitals should be notified a story should be issued to the presswarning of a possible stalker in the area this isnt new york agent mulder people keep their doors unlocked herethis is gonna scare em well leave out the more gruesome aspectsin your press release why do you want to alarm folksif this guy only preys on dead people because his compulsion is growing he mayresort to homicide to procure his corpses once he gets the taste of a warm bodyhes probably gonna want more maybe ive been isolated up herein the great white north too long what do you mean people wondered why it took them so longto catch this kid in milwaukee thought someone shouldve noticedhe was killing all those young boys truth is no one ever believedit could happen if you catch this guy firstmaybe they can go on believing that we dont have the manpower or expertiseto move on this with any speed its gonna be hard to round up anybodyon a saturday it could be monday or tuesdaybefore we get our ducks in a row we have some work to do hereim gonna cancel our flight out  scully ill be right there a complete model or psychologicalprofile of the death fetishist does not exist the compulsion is a resultof a complex misplacement of values and a deviation fromcultural norms and social mores he is more likely to be white male andof average to aboveaverage intelligence cases of fetishists with iqs over 150have been documented the progression of the pathologymoves from the fantasy stage to the eventual acting out of fetishisticimpulses including opportunistic homicide agent mulder believes that the suspectin this case is escalating towards this action once he begins to murder the killingdraws attention away from a deeper motive a motive which most people including lawenforcement professionals dare not imagine it is somehow easier to believeas agent bocks does in aliens and ufos than in the kind of inhuman monsterwho could prey on the living to scavenge from the dead hi hello there  hi hi are you looking for a date yes why dont you pull uparound the corner over there well actually i was thinkingof a couple of hours where do you have in mind dont you have any heat in

come near me i mean it dont you touch me stay away from me keep away from medont you come near me were still waitingfor someone to id the body judging from the areaid say shes probably a working girl watch your step no oh my god oh my god who did this to her  was it him looks like it knife wound the length of the torsocut all her hair off took her fingernails this time he took some fingers too  wanna see the body yeah i need a minute hey let him take a look hi im your new delivery man oh hi come in did they give you skips old route yes i think soive just started with the company skips been

now ok ok you have a good time  bye bye we have three daughters oh pardon me may i use your washroomto wash up my hands sure theres a washroom just off the porch i just wanted to tell you if were ever nothome we always leave the back door open oh thank you ill remember that death is a recorded event for reasons natural or unnatural when a body ceases to function the causeof the effect can be clearly reconstructed a body has a story to tell the time is 1114am monday november 14th the deceased is a female in her twenties if the victim was strangled an examinationof the veins in the eyes will reveal this if shot entry woundsand gunpowder residue can be used to reconstruct the events leading to deathand help to establish a possible motive hair and fibres slivers of glassplastic even insect casings can serve to recreate the circumstancesunder which death occurred it may be an irony only understood by thoseof us who conduct these examinations that death like life itself is a dramawith a beginning middle and end it is my opinionhaving conducted this examination that the victim died a wrongful death for thepurpose of extracting her hair and fingernails the time of deathcannot be accurately judged due i believe to immersion ina cold environment most likely water for the record it is my opinion that outside of child homicidewhich may be more tragic this is one of the most angryand dehumanising murders imaginable mmmm i just dont know look at each man carefully hes none of those guys he was ordinaryhe didnt look like no freak do you remember what kind of carhe was driving what colour it was i think it was white ok you can go just leave a numberand address where you can be reached  you gonna catch this guy well catch him might be a good week to takethat paid vacation the boss owes you yeah right if this guy looks regular and doesnt have arecord hes gonna be near impossible to find until he kills again or untilwe can determine what drives him i read your profile sounds like he cant makeit with women it would explain the hooker the hooker was just convenienthes after trophies his victim was a young attractive womanthe corpses he dug up were young women whats fuelling his need whats importantabout the hair and fingernails to him its as if its not enough that theyre deadhes also gotta defile them theres a deeper psychosis here its an unfathomable hatred of womenprobably going back to his mother id say shes pretty fried at him too i think we should callall the psychiatric facilities in the area and ask if they have any patientswith similar pathologies this kind of a monster isnt made overnighthes been developing this fetish for years the necessity of the storymyth in a culture is almost universal we think of myths as thingsthat entertain or instruct but their deeper purposeis often to explain or make fanciful desires wishes or behaviour that societywould otherwise deem unacceptable because they are conveyedin a wrapping of untruththe story  these thoughts become harmless take for example the storieswe recite to our children snow white alice in wonderland the subtextual themeswhen the queen orders off with her head or the prince awakenssleeping beauty with a kiss are what freud would describeas deathwish imaginings excuse me im in your mythology class  uhhuh my names donnie i sit a couple of rows overmaybe youve seen me  uh i dont know i i know you sit up front i just see i i was going to my carand i saw you and did he ask us to readchapters 10 and 11 or 11 and 12 oh i uh i think it was uh  it was chapters 10

to bethe devil in a buttondown shirt its said that the fear of the unknown is aresponse to the excesses of the imagination but our fear of the everyday of the lurkingstranger of footfalls on the stairs the fear of violent deathand the impulse to survive are as frightening as any xfile as real as the acceptancethat it could happen to you as real as the acceptancethat it could happen to you i
