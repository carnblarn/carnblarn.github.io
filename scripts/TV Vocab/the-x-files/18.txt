                power saw whirring  hurry and get him out of there  i need two men on the left side now  wait where you goin with him  hes dead  theres a woman over there who isnt  and she needs some oxygen  boy i want you to rise  rise up and heal  what the hell you doing  boys laying on hands  rise up  and accept the miracle  hes given you  you dont understand the mans dead  then the boy cant possibly do any harm can he  for this  is the power of belief  the power to separate the light from the darkness  to create life from death  amen  shows over  lets clear the area  hallelujah samuel hallelujah  singing gospel  yes indeed praise god  yes yes yes  i want everybody to say hallelujah  congregation hallelujah  praise the lord  the woman on the table has a malignant tumor on her spine  this boy here will attempt  to heal her by simply laying his hands on her  where did you get this  from the regional office in tennessee  the preachers name is  reverend calvin hartley  youve heard ofhim  the boy is his adopted son samuel  he claims to have found him as an infant  iying in the tall weeds near the muddy mississippi  he also claims the boy brought a man back from the dead  its more than a claim  the man he saved appears as a regular attraction  in the reverends tent ministry  the boys been performing miracles  every week for the past ten years twice on sunday  not according to the kenwood sheriff  local authorities think  reverend hartley and his son are a scam  theyve been trying to shut them down  but without any luck  theyve turned to the fbi to try and get a prosecution  forwhat fraud  no murder  watch the tape  lucy kelly has the cancer  her doctors say it is inoperable  they say it is incurable  but i say to you  that what the doctors cannot cure  the lord can  congregation amen  yes indeed praise god  because god  can work miracles   yes lord  praise god  the clear light of gods healing love  is fowing  through samuels healing hands  was rushed to the hospital  she was pronounced dead on arrival  what caused her death  i dont know but it wasnt cancer  theyve requested someone  with a medical background to assist local police  i know its not an x file  when do we leave for tennessee  i think i saw some of these same people at woodstock  mulder you werent at woodstock  i saw the movie  you all right by yourself  ill be fine  i wont be long  okay  sighing  hartley most of you here today i know as neighbors  and as cherished members ofour miracle ministry  but some ofyou have come from far away  as far away  as pensacola florida  cheering  and uniondale long lsland  wayne ashtown and his family  and it is especially to those ofyou  who come from so far  that i must apologize from the bottom ofmy heart  because unfortunately  samuel cannot be here this afternoon  i know how very deeply disappointed  each and every one of you must be feeling right now  but i say unto you do not be dismayed  do not despair  do not lose your hope  because in two short days samuel will be back here  at our very special miracle mission  yes indeed praise god  maybe we should head backstage  and see what the reverend has to say  wait this is where they bring out elvis  as these people will testify  samuel can heal you  yes samuel will heal you  but  only if you believe  god bless you  scully reverend hartley were with the fbl  i see sheriff daniels has sent in the cavalry  we just want to talk to samuel  for a couple of minutes  hes not here  mulder well where is he  i dont know  i havent seen him  that boys been a bit troubled lately  were running late reverend  if youll excuse me  agent mulder  yeah  sheriff daniels  we spoke on the phone  this is special agent dana scully  you requested a copy of the coroners report  right thankyou  i see you got a chance  to take in the holy roller sideshow  something tells me youre not a member  of the reverends fock  i remember hartley  when he was a soapbox preacher  collecting dollar bills in coffee cans  since the boyjoined the act  hes gotten himselfa cadillac for every day of the week  bought forwith money  that should be used to improve our roads and schools  people want to believe  in this world are fools  and the rest ofus are in great danger of contagion  even if hartley and samuel are fakes  its still a long way  from accusing the boy of murder  witnesses say the boy was there  laying hands on those people when they died  you think thats how he killed them with a touch  i dont know how  but weve been looking for him since tuesday  and he does not want to be found  theres nothing unusual about these reports  except that there were no autopsies  hartley blocked my autopsy request  on religious grounds  it doesnt help that the county coroner  is a member of the miracle ministry  maybe we can arrange  to have them exhumed  to have them exhumed  sheriff  its reverend hartleys group  damn  i told my people to keep quiet so this wouldnt happen  looks like you might have a few believers  on the payroll  man on behalf of the miracle ministry  we demand that you stop this sacrilege  youre not just dealing with me anymore vance  youre dealing with the fbl  we dont mean you any disrespect  were investigating a possible homicide  federal law requires we do a postmortem examination on these bodies  im afraid we answer to a higher authority  than the us government one that considers grave digging  and defiling corpses mortal sins  daniels well get that autopsy vance  sooner or later you know we will  the deceaseds family  does not want her grave disturbed  carol wallace had no family  we were her family  we were her family  and it was hard enough to bury her once  so if you insist on going through with this  were prepared to maintain a vigil  and do whatever it takes to stop you  daniels mulder  scully  what  one of my men just spotted the boys car downtown  cant do much here  mulder lets go  daniels not a very likely place to be saving souls  wheres the boy zook  hes in the can  what happened here  damn fool started a fight  figures them bible thumpers  wouldnt know how to hold their liquor  where you been samuel  weve been looking for you  yeah  ive been thinking  well youre going to have plenty of time  for that now son  im putting you under arrest  for murder  for suspicion ofmurder  you mind if i finish my beer first  well you go right on ahead  im going to have somebody take a statement from you  ill see what i can do  about getting your caddie towed  hey sheriff  what evidence do you have  to charge the boy with murder  well what more do you want  the boys practically given himself up  hes drunk though  well then ill add drunk and disorderly  lets get this straight  its not a question about the boys guilt  just how he did it  let me have a minute with him  suit yourself  samuel im agent mulder  this is agent scully  were from the fbl  looks like you took quite a beating there  penance mr mulder  some might call it a plain old bar brawl  you know what they say   he giveth and he taketh away  man gets too proud  sometimes it does him good  to get the crap kicked out of him  saves god the trouble  the trouble of what  humbling the guilty sinner  guilty of murder  yes sir  how did you do it samuel  apparently my pride and my weakness  were an invitation to the devil  i muddied the river of my own faith  now my gift has been corrupted  youre saying that you killed those people with a touch  ive laid my hands on the ill given them health  ive healed the sick  ive even touched the dying and given them life  god has given me a special gift  did he buy you all that jewelry too  something is missing in your story  do you doubt the power of god maam  no but i doubt the veracity of your claims  i have looked on the infirm and seen their sickness  their cancer  just as i can see the pain  on this man right here  really  what pain is that  the pain you have  regarding a brother  or a sister  its an old pain  its never been healed  is this some kind  of a trick  no trick maam  lets get the sheriff  i want to hear more about this pain tell me  i can see it plain as day  it was a sister  you lost a sister quiteyoung  someone took her away  what else do you see  strangers  a bright light  sheriff  samuel you should have come here earlier  i could have healed your pain  lets get this overwith  i need another minute  i cant help you not anymore  my gift is gone  cuff him  lets go  you have the right to remain silent  ill tell you mr mulder  god watches over his fock  he gives us signs every day  open your heart  he mightjust open your eyes  how do you think  he does it  i dont know  woman given his exemplary record  and the highly circumstantial nature ofthis case  i ask that my client be released  on his own recognizance  without bail  judge that is not a good idea  samuel  let me go  and it will be on your head  enough  this is not a pulpit this is a court oflaw  is that understood  yes sir  sorry  man your honor despite the defendants  avowed guilt  we see no reason to burden the county  with his maintenance until trial  but we do request a minimum bail of1 00000  all right ifthere are no objections  bail is set at 1 00000  to be deposited directly into the clerks  probation account  my god  what is it  good god  my god  what is it  what is this  what  what  oh god  how much more  will it take foryou to believe  the lord has testified against me  does the serpent have to biteyou  on the ass till you understand  everybody clear this courtroom  mulder and when it was morning  the east wind brought the locusts  and the locusts covered the face ofthe whole earth  so that the land was darkened  and they did eat every herb  come on mulder  and all the fruit ofthe trees which the hail  a few thousand grasshoppers  does not constitute a plague  besides were in farm country  this area is an agricultural smorgasbord  for this type ofinfestation  maybe in a cornfield but this happened in a courtroom  so whats next  the slaying ofthe firstborn  chuckles  does this have to do  with what samuel said in the bar last night  aboutyour sister  i had these patient cases sent over  from kenwood county hospital  these are physiciandocumented cases  ofpatients who went to samuel  after conventional treatments failed  spontaneous remission ofmetastatic cancer   regenerated nerve growth after posttrauma paraplegia  i have encountered dozens ofpsychic healers  but none like this  i think the kid is for real  this is intriguing  but there is a whole library ofmedical literature  dealing with unexplained spontaneous cures  now western medicine treats the human body  in biochemical terms  but the body could also be treated  as an electromagnetic system  soyour theory is that ifsamuel  can repair this energy field to heal  he can also destroy it to kill  why not  okay say that samuels touch can kill  whywould he want to  he said he muddied the river ofhis own faith meaning  knock at door  ifyoure available  reverend would like to seeyou  hartley ive been under a lot ofstress lately  which i know doesnt excuse my rude behavioryesterday  but i hopeyou found it in your hearts to forgive me  why did you want to speakwith us  i need your help  samuel is being tried for murder  you need a good lawyer  samuel is innocent  how can you be sure  because hes my son  that argument will not work on ajury  and samuels confession wont help much either  you have to understand  samuel is a very complicated young man  he feels things like no one else  to him a pinprick becomes a gaping wound  his power comes  from this ability to feel  but some people fear that power  and out oftheirweakness and their fear  they seek to destroy it  you mean sheriff daniels  its no secret sheriff daniels has been trying to shut me down  since i first opened my tent  ten years ago  he seems to think  thatyour ministry is a fraud  hes a faithless man agent scully  his wife she suffers from a most painful arthritis  her fingers are twisted like bitter roots  yet he keeps samuel from ministering to her  in light ofrecent events you cant blame him  i dont know how those poor people died  i cant explain that  which is why im asking you to be there tonight  soyou could see foryourselves  samuel doing gods work  can i count on you both to be there  i think so mulder what doyou think  excuse me  where did she go  who  the little girl  theres no little girl around here  scully mulder  a little girl  brothers and sisters helpyourselves  let the folks

i saw this man come back  from beyond deaths door  he stands here today as a living testament  to the ability ofgod  to work miracles  ladies and gentlemen  brothers and sisters  our beloved friend

gasping  gasping louder  loud heaving  what haveyou done boy  all right everyone remain calm  give this young woman some room  everybody praise god   say hallelujah  get an ambulance  dont panic now just praise the lord  oh my baby  shes dead  sobbing  my lovely friends children ofgod  brothers and sisters  ifyou desecrate the body  then you slay the soul  lets keep this poorwomans body intact  we know that reverend hartleys  been pressuring you  but this is the third death linked  with the miracle ministry  reverend hartley says  an autopsy is against scripture  what illness did your daughter suffer from mr hohman  she had ms  has she ever had a seizure before this  not to my knowledge  you see i think that the seizure she had  is indicative ofsome kind ofembolism or aneurysm  but the boy only touched her forehead  and areyou going to be content  to bury herwithout knowing the true cause ofdeath  without knowing ifthere was foul play involved  give me a moment  you think the boy really did it  no  why not  i was raised a catholic  and i have a certain familiarity with the scripture  and god never lets the devil steal the show  you must have really liked the exorcist  one ofmy favorite movies  well  so who wereyou pursuing in the crowd tonight  i thought i saw someone i knew  that boy really has you going doesnt he  why doyou say that  in the bar samuel mentioned your sister  is ityour sister you thinkyoure seeing  ive seen her twice now  maybeyoujust want to see her  im not delusional scully  dont discount the power ofsuggestion  a healers greatest magic  iies in the patients willingness to believe  imagine a miracle youre halfway there  we learned that in med school  you think this is what margaret hohman  or her parents were imagining  were going to go along with your investigation  its 1 1 21 pm march 7  subjects name is margaret hohman  female caucasian   mulder take a look at this  do i have to  lesions on the lungs here  im finding them throughout the cardiovascular  and pulmonary systems  theres also damage to the mucous membranes  she must have died from cellular hypoxia  a lack ofoxygen to the cells  what would cause that  my guess lngestion or injection  ofsodium or potassium cyanide maybe arsenic  i wont know exactly  until i run a toxicology screen on her  how soon  lab opens in the morning  see whoyou can push to get it done as soon as possible  door clanks shut  footsteps  samuel its agent mulder  yeah what doyou want  i want to talkwith you  ifyoud preferyour attorneywere present  whatever no  i put a call in to sheriff daniels hes on his way down here   im going to ask him to releaseyou  why areyou doing this  you were there man  you saw foryourself  did you poison margaret hohman  did i poison her  did you poison her using potassium or sodium cyanide  because thats what killed her  what areyou talking about  youre innocent samuel  unless you had a hand in administering it i dont thinkyou did  whatever the cause mr mulder i am responsible  evidence will be presented tomorrow  habeas corpus law will force them to releaseyou  you should go home and get some rest  just leave me alone okay  ifyou think the punishment foryour sins  is the deaths ofthose people  the lord has testified against me  i cant stand here and argue with your biblical rhetoric  but i do know that the law will find you innocent  you said you could see my pain  look at me  what doyou see now  i see nothing  i am blind  i dont believeyou  ive seen her  it was her wasnt it  your sister  you made her appear to me didntyou  look at me  i am very tired mr mulder  is she alive  is that what im supposed to believe  or is this a trick  you mean  a trick ofthe devil  exasperated sigh  jailer  i see im a little late for the ball  i wanted you to release the boy  on what pretense  his innocence  arentyou out ofyour depth here  this may be hicksville toyou  but we do try and hew to the legal system  he seems determined to stay here anyway  what does that tell you  it tells meyoure determined to have him charged  whileyour real homicide suspect is still at large  footsteps  got some company forya sam  grunting  what areyou looking at  doorbell rings  ill get it  ill get it  maam sheriff  hey dennis how areya  just fine maamjust fine  except we had an incident down at thejail  what incident tyson  the preacher boy  hes dead  he was alone in his cell when mulder left him this morning  how could this have happened  the boy started a fight  with a couple ofrowdies we picked up on a dui  took some mean blows to the head  died before the ambulance got here  his blood is spilled  and its all overyou  reverend  how much longer  areyou going to hide behind that badge  before the truth is revealed  i have work to do  reverend hartley  were sorry foryour loss  that boy he was blessed  he never hurt a soul  vance come on there reverend  our friends will find out about samuel  sooner than later and well  its probably best ifthey hear it from you  come on  maam  you got that look on your face mulder  what look is that  the kind when youve forgotten your keys  and youre trying to figure out  how to get back in the house  what exactly are we trying to find  clues  oh  what does it mean  mulder lets find out  scully  its potato  someone left a trail offood  in the ventilation system leading to the courtroom  you dumpyour locusts in here  instant plague  where do they come from  biological supply houses  hatch them on order to farms and universities  shouldnt be too hard to find out who set this up  and you think whoever did this  is responsible for the murders  frightened gasp  youre dead  they killed you  i was dead  but here i am  no  why did you betray me  you murdered those people  they came to me to be healed  and you murdered them  why  after i gaveyou backyour life  you call this life  knocking  what in tarnation doyou want  we have a warrant  for the arrest of leonard vance  where is he  you must be mistaken  scully afraid not reverend  we traced a pesticide order to him  from a chemical company  cyanogen bromide  its a cyanide derivative  leonard poisoned those people  whimpering  getyour clothes on vance  youre under arrest  i betrayed him  cyanide  theres no way to tell how much hes ingested  ill call an ambulance  we have to get him to the hospital ourselves  i thought why didnt he let me die  beware offalse prophets  who come toyou in sheeps clothing  but inwardly are ravening wolves  thats what i thought he was  because who else would bring me back  iooking like this  he was here   who  samuel  the mans delirious  he was here reverend  right in this room  and he forgave me  choking gasp  scully rather than simply killing samuel  vance contrived to kill the ministrys faith in him  we have conclusive evidence  connecting him both to the courtroom infestation  and to the poisoning deaths  ofthree members ofthe ministry  vances obsession outlived samuel however  his conscience haunted him until he became delusory  and finally took his own life  effectively ending our investigation  in light ofthis information  it is highly doubtful  that there have ever been any miracles  in kenwood tennessee  phone rings  mulder  knock at door  scully  sheriff danielsjust called  samuels body is missing from the morgue  anywitnesses  one so far  the night nurse who made the report  beatrice salinger  she saw somebody take him  not actually  what doyou mean  talk sense deputy  she didnt exactly see anyone taking the body  well what then  she uh  she claims she saw samuel walking out by himself  sounds crazy i know but thats what she told me  you coming sheriff  i was drinking my coffee  and going over the night orders  for myward seven south  when he walked right by me  his face was all black and blue  youre sure it was him  well at first i thought my eyes were playing tricks  which happens a lot on graveyard  so i got up to look again  but i lost him around a corner  hejust vanished  then i went to check the morgue  and his bodywas gone  daniels this is insane  i wont listen to any more ofthis crazy talk  im not the only one who saw him sheriff  so i know im not crazy  other people saw him too  im not crazy  it was samuel  lillian this isnt true maurice is it  the boywas an awful fake  just likeyou said wasnt he maurice  wasnt he maurice  knocking  sir  going to have to askyou  to come with me  district attorney  wants to askyou some questions  concerning the boys death  sundays will probably never be the same again  in these parts  i have a strong sense the reverend hartley  is not going to be able to give up the pulpit  even without his son  might even strengthen his faith  the boy did rise from the dead  that kind ofthing happens only once or twice  every 2000 years or so  yeah and i have a story about a plague oflocusts  i just hope reverend hartley  didnt arrange his body snatching  as his miracle ofmiracles  somehow i dont think so  what exactly doyou think  i think people are looking hard for miracles  so hard that maybe they make themselves see  what theywant to see  you coming mulder  i made this
