                 they were to check in at midnight you try every band  all audiovisual seemed to be down maybe its just a satellite glitch we thought so too until we received thisfrom a tracking station in bend oregon they picked it upon an emergency frequency what are those guys doing we did manage to uplinkfirewalkers video camera its at base camp so we hope it cangive us a picture tell us whats going on data feeds coming in now  whats the robot doing in the volcano i dont know theres no descent scheduled firewalkers not respondingi cant get control  someones overriding it lock camera remote and pan left stop stop go back tilt up and zoom in erikson what the hell give me that there it is again did you see thatyou saw that shadow didnt you yeah but what could be moving aroundin that kind of heat i dont know maybe it was uh just a ghost signali mean it wouldnt be the first time that whats going on up there lets go to our science editor ericparker in mount avalon washington eric im standing herewith a group of scientists who are excited about this devicewhich looks like a large titanium bug firewalker will next week makeits first descent into an active volcano this robot is the brainchildof volcanologist daniel trepkos it will gather samplesfrom the crater which may hold scientific dataabout the earths core scientific data were talking about revisitingthe very origin of the earth peering into the fire where it all began a human endeavour more important eventhan mans exploration of space thats no mean claim daniel always had a flairfor selfdramatisation  id always heard that he was brilliant brilliant doesnt go quite far enough he occupies a rare placeamong scientists where dreams ambition andgreat luck converge you think his luck just ran out the team sent a distress signal yesterdayafter failing to make a status report they havent responded to any of our calls but by using remote telemetrywe were able to activate firewalkers camera this is what we found youre looking at the floor of the volcano but this is the last thingwe expected to discover the dead man is uh phil eriksonchief seismologist now look at this whoa what the hell is that we dont know whatever it was disabled the camera the temperature readingsare upwards of 130 at this depth  but that was alive why werent you there i left the project six weeks agotrepkos and i nearly came to blows  over what well i wish i could explain daniel and i uh i always played salieri to his mozarti was never quite on his plane of intellect but this time i found him slipping into madness  he controlled the others you think hes responsible for this whatever there is between me and himi pray that he isnt weve got 20 million tax dollarsin this project if word of it were to get out it could destroy years of workim afraid to go through proper channels yeah were not exactly proper channels  how soon can we get up there theres a flight waiting to take us to seattle from there a helicopterwill fly us to mount avalon scully  i dont think its a good idea for you to go mulder i appreciate your concern but im ready  i wanna work well maybe you should take some time off ive already lost too much time there it is this was firewalkers satellite relay we installed field instruments hereseismographs tiltmeters well look here after weve checked inside the instruments are worth millions of projectdollars im accountable to the usgs for em  shouldnt we find the descent team first i just wanna take a quick damage survey ill catch up with you in a few minutes hello looks like somebody wanted to put thisoperation permanently out of commission mulder  wait wait whats going on  this isnt what it looks like he just about took my head off i told you i made a mistake okim sorry all right  who the hell are you im im ludwig im jason ludwig  im the robotics engineer do you always greet people this way i heard a noise i thought it was himi was protecting myself you know selfpreservation who did you think i was that you thoughtyou had to protect yourself trepkos sometimes he wouldnt talk to us for daysthen boom you couldnt get him to shut up dont get me wrong ok no one revered the man more than me i mean he was a prophet an oracle he saw things ii i mean hehe saw things that you and me we only dream about and then forget when we wake up well its ok you can come out nowthe cavalrys here this is peter tanaka our systems analyst and uh this is jesse oneil are you the rescue team  no were with the fbi fbi but youre taking us back right  after weve investigated what happened trepkos is what happened  did he kill erikson he flipped out right after the descent he just flipped out can you think of anything that mightvecaused or contributed to his behaviour  youre asking me daniel was sick he had a bipolar disorderi think thats what it was it wasnt a secret but its notsomething he advertised either but with his medication he was just fine well i think eriksons wifemight disagree with that youre part of the team jesse daniel was my thesis advisorat the university he asked me to assist him on this project  are these his notes oh yeah well whatevers left of em first thing he did wasdestroy all his own work you know his field journalshis computer disks we salvaged what we could but i dont really thinkyoull find much in there of use anyway hello anyone there scully what dyou makeof mr trepkoss neighbourhood  what dyou mean isnt their behaviour bizarre paranoid  after what theyve been through no theyre practically climbing the walls theyve been living inthe middle of nowhere for a year one is dead probablyat the hands of another you have to expect some heightened levelof emotional distress its more than that theressomething theyre not telling us based on what based on when ludwigtried to play tball with my head he knew i wasnt trepkos  now mulder youre sounding paranoid pierce knows these people lets find out what he thinks ok no one can leave pierce  hes not here pierce  somethings happened oh my god get over here hes over hereive found him ive found him ive found him  that should do it what shall we do with the body  do you have a freezer yeah  radio for the helicopter im almost done let me help you no thats ok we got him  we cant leave scully not yet why not  trepkos is still out there he killed pierce and probably erikson  we should come back with a larger party no ive been going over trepkoss work i foundreferences to a subterranean organism  what an organism existing within the volcano no specific description mulder nothing can livein a volcanic interior not only because of the intense heatbut the gasses would be toxic what does this say it describes the metabolism fromhydrogen sulphide into silicon dioxide a siliconbased life form the basic building block for everyorganism known to man is carbon  from bacterium to redwood trees silicon is the closest element to carbon it reacts identically with other elements it combines to form complex molecules a siliconbased life form is one ofthe holy grails of modern science maybe trepkos found it mulder that is science fiction its anelaborate construct from a delusional mind this doesnt prove anything trepkos said he had evidenceits gotta be here somewhere  whatever evidence he had he destroyed maybe it wasnt trepkos who destroyed it  what if it was one of the others why would they do that all of these people are suffering tovarying degrees from posttraumatic stress and from a medical point of view we have toget them out of here sooner rather than later jesse can i talk to you are you ok i hate this place what happened here jesse you can trust me after the first descent daniel changed he became withdrawn and paranoid he locked himself in the labfor three days and wouldnt let any of us in do you think the descenttriggered his breakdown well thats what i thought and then i found out that hes not taking his pills lithium carbonate yeah he said thatthey were polluting his brain and he said i was polluting his body im scared  i dont wanna die here what are you so afraid of jesse daniel the only reason i even came herewas because of him he promised methat this would be an adventure that it would change my life but eight months is a long timeand i just wanna go home now wheres home anywhere but here samples 7 12 and 22 alsocontain trace evidence of the organism the possibility of this newor perhaps unfathomably old life form has left me sleepless wonderingif i havent lost all perspective if my intense desire to find the truthhasnt finally eclipsed the truth itself our meddling intellect misshapesthe beauteous forms of things we murder to dissect my mind is a tangled knoti can no longer untie daily i fight the urge to sever it completelyto stop this descent what caused that tremor theres been a lot of seismic activityin the northeast rift zone if trepkos hadnt destroyed our instrumentswe might have learned something from it you feeling all right yeah agent scullys a medical doctorlet her take a look at you  im fine just let her take a look no ill go get scully  come on get up shell help you i dont want her to of course you do its for the best we have to get out of here he just collapsed after the tremorhe seems pretty bad  hes burning up what is it an infection or a toxic reactionweve gotta get him to a hospital  ill get a stretcher we cant just leave trepkos give me the shortwave this is agent scully with the firewalkerteam come in search and rescue ill get oneiland meet you at the landing site this is search and rescue request dispatch of medevac immediately we have an asian male midthirtiesspiking a highgrade fever tanakas collapsed were getting him out  tanaka peter peter come on get back here there  come on dont go down there  let me go whatre you doing let go of me dont go down there for gods sakes he needs our help so what is it scullywhat are we dealing with without better imaging equipmenti cant say for sure ill take any theory youve got  it appears to be some kind of a fungus anything you recognise well im not a botanist but i think itsfair to guess that its an unknown genus  what am i looking at here spores i scraped them off the tip of the fungus it appears as if one of the spores grew insidetanaka until it reached reproductive maturity essentially outgrowing its host but by then it had caused massive tissuedamage particularly to the respiratory tract  that accounts for the sand in his lungs you found sand in his lungs silicon dioxide the waste productof a siliconbased organism wait a second there theres no such thingas a siliconbased organism maybe now there is but we wont have proof untilwe determine its molecular structure come on how else do you explainthe sand in his lungs its the best trace evidencewe could ask for trepkos was right daniel knew about this he discovered a sporein the samples firewalker brought up he wouldve told us not if what he discovered wastoo disturbing even for him to understand this might explain something elsethe spore could explain trepkoss dementia fungi contain alkaloidsthat affect the nervous system yeah but what about usi mean we werent exposed we dont know that if it was an airbornemicrobe any of us couldve inhaled a spore so were not going home right not until we know how its transmittedhow it incubates if even one of us is infected we could riskinfecting a much larger population search and rescue this isagent mulder do you copy this is search and rescuewere in a holding pattern over notify fbi district hq in spokane that werein quarantine due to possible contagion have cdc send up an evacuation uniton high alert whats the nature of the contagion agent mulder tell them its a biological agentof unknown origin thats affirmative standing by maybe you should go check up on oneil im gonna go find trepkos  what if hes already dead hell find it tough answering my questions ive gotta find out what he knows it could change our understandingof the origin and evolution of life hes dangerous mulderhes already killed two men  then i have to find out why will you at least let me go with you no look i know what youre thinkingbut you have to get past that we both do im back and im not going anywhere you have to finish the autopsy on tanaka hopefully thatll give us a better ideaof what were dealing withwhatever it is im counting on you to keep us allfrom ending up on that slab  do like we said ok mmhm mmhm you know what to say right i could use a little help excuse me  so what do you need directions a contour map usgs survey anything that can help me get here oh these are the steam caves they feed into the sherman craterthats how we access the caldera  how did you get these firewalker they were transmitted right beforetrepkos destroyed his camera oh so youre finally gonna go after trepkos well ill tell you one thing you wont find him with those  and you wont find him with any map either how will i find him you wont  not without a guide a guide yeah a guideive been up here for almost a year i spent months in those caves charting every fissure every creviceso firewalker wouldnt trip if trepkos is there i can find him  why are you so eager to help me find him oh im im not eager i just dont want to wait around for trepkos todo to me what he did to pierce and erikson plus youve got the gun youre the only onewho can get us out of this place whatever im smelling is it toxic between the heat and the sulphur it can getpretty nasty in here but it wont hurt you youll get used to it  how far does the cave extend three quarters of a mile to the crater rim lets head in it twists around quite a bittill you get there lots of dead ends and blind drops unless you know where youre goingyoure like a rat in a maze argh argh argh your gun back get back why are you doing this trepkoshes already dead how many times do you have to kill him its not him im trying to kill i have attempted to culture the spore usingtemperatures ranging from human basal to those approximatingthe volcanic interior i have used nutritive mediums containing human tissue blood and salivaeven sulphur however none of the seven trials have successfully grownthe fungus that killed tanaka based on this preliminary datai have come to the following hypothesis that unless the spores are ingestedor inhaled by the host organism immediately upon their release they become harmless effectively dead jesse what is it i thought youd like to knowthe chancesare good that none of us were infected we were a safe distance from tanaka whenmulder and ludwig come back we can leave i i just need to run a few more testsbut i think were gonna be ok ow oooh ok jesse jesse what went wrong trepkos firewalker carried something backto the surface firewalker brought up an elephant the truth is an elephant described by three blind men the first man touches the tailand says its a rope the second man feels the rough legand says its a tree the third man feels the trunkand says its a snake what about you what do you say it is i say the earth holds some truthsbest left buried like the spore  who are you im special agent mulder im with the fbi you dont look like a policeman i came down here to investigateeriksons death thats not why youre here you still believe you can petition heavenand get some penetrating answer if you found that answer what would you do with it i just wanna know what happenedafter the first descent what did you find it was porous obsidian erikson thought it was some sort of rockso i told him to pulverise it for analysis  erikson released the spore he discovered a new life form in a single moment all that scienceheld sacred suddenly turned on its head  what about erikson lf if he was infected i was too immersed in the work to notice id been alone in the lab for three dayswhen i heard their screams they were all gathered around him by the time i realised what was happeningthey were already changing the spore grew in each of themuntil it became what do you mean its a parasite it lives to find a host  but you werent infected no you destroyed your work the equipment you killed pierce so no one could leave no one can leave what about oneil jesse  was she exposed to the spore they were all exposed  all of them i have a colleague a friend whos with oneil right now  let me go to her she may already be infected i cant let you leave then youre gonna have to shoot me because im walking outta here jesse oh god you scared me jesse are you ok jesse whats wrong jesse jesse what are you doing scully scully im ok im ok  you all right im ok yeah mulder look she was infected i dont know how erikson was the original host when the fungus shed its spores everyonewas at ground zero except for trepkos did you find him i told her it would change her life search and rescuethis is agent mulder do you copy this is army biohazardhow many are in your party we have two survivors agent scully and myself copy that our eta is seven minutes mulder what are you doingtheyre gonna wanna question him its all over scully he wont talk scully and i are in the third dayof a months quarantine undergoing level four decon procedures we are so far without symptomsof fungal contamination our specimens and field notes were taken bythe biohazard corps prior to our evacuation their presence is delayed indefinitely forthe arrival of the usgs data retrieval team i suspect though there will belittle left for them to retrieve there are no plans to explore the volcanicallyactive mountains in the cascade range including mount avalon all access points to that volcanohave been sealed off by army engineers of the membersof the firewalker descent team only trepkos and oneilremain unaccounted for they are presumed deadand the search for them has been abandoned firewalker however was recovered though its sensory and locomotive systemswere found to be irreparably damaged the data it collected from the earths interiorwill never be known and of the events that occurred at mountavalon between 11 and 13 november 1994 mine stands as the only record i made this
