quarantined  by who the cdc the cdc has nothing to do with this its the company theyre behind everything pinck pharmaceuticalsyou work for pinck pharmaceuticals how did this happen we finance exploration ofnew species from the rainforest with potential drug applications three months ago a field entomologistdisappeared in costa rica  disappeared how were not sure he just sent us some samples of an insect like this i found this buriedin one of the dead prisoners faciphaga emasculata we were interested in it becauseof a dilating enzyme it secretes is this what caused the outbreak no no not precisely f emasculata is a parasitoid a bug that carries a parasite in this case a deadly parasitethat attacks the immune system the pustules are part ofthe natural reproductive cycle theyre full of the larvae thatyou see there on the scope so the contagion only spreadswhen the pustules erupt and the larvae that are expelledburrow into the new host agent scully you were therewhen the pustule erupted on me which means you may also be infected come in  thank you for seeing me at this late hour what is it this case weve been assigned i believeweve been misled possibly deceived  deceived by whom whoever originated the case what is the accusation agent mulder that we were sent on this manhunt withoutknowledge of the existence of the contagion  what is the exact nature of the contagion its deadly it kills within 36 hours one escaped convict was infected hes dead now the other man may be infectedand hes on the loose does anyone know whetherits a virus or a bacteria we know that over a dozen men have diedfrom it it appears to be highly contagious  then you dont know much why werent we told the truth we didnt know the truth what we knewwould have slowed you down innocent people could be infectedyou could have prevented that how in 1988 there was an outbreakof haemorrhagic fever in sacramento the truth would have caused panicpanic would have cost lives  we controlled it by controlling information you cant protect the public by lying its done every day i wont be a party to it how about you youre a party to it already how many people are being infectedwhile you stand here not doing your job ten twentywhats the truth agent mulder  mulder mulder theyre enforcing a full quarantine what one of the epidemiologistswho claimed to be with the cdc told me that this was no accident pinck pharmaceutical is heretrying to clean it up quietly  and the government would have to know do you have proof of that why else would the national guard be heretheyre protecting pinck pharmaceutical i need to know how this happened documenteverything you can get your hands on  people have to know about the coverup the public  its a publichealth crisis we cant leak this not until we know more the fugitive youre looking formight not even be infected  what if he is if this gets out the panic is gonna spread faster thanthe contagion we cant let this be known what if someone diesbecause we withheld what we knew what if someone dies because we didnt therell be a time for the truthmulder but this isnt it are you ok in there scully yeah im ok all i want you toworry about is capturing that fugitive take care of yourself mulder if youre not infectedyou should leave immediately and if i am the parasite is undetectablein the bloodstream this is the only way to testwhether or not youve been infected these uninfected insects act as incubators now the insects bite wont infect you the contagion can only be contractedthrough exposure to the larvae how long will this take thirty minutes then another two hours before the parasite reproducesenough for us to see it elizabeth my name is fox mulderim with the fbi  where did paul go elizabeth i dont know i think you do know and i think you know why youre in here  how are you feeling im fine steve felt fine tooit didnt take long for that to change  youre just tryin to scare me you should be scared  if i were you id be scared youre lyin paul is the one who was lying and ifhes infected a lot of people are gonna die if thats true how come its not on tvhow come theyre not tellin everybody  thats not my decision well

bus to torontoshe was supposed to be with him that bus depots over a halfhour from here  get on to the local pd they dont know what theyre dealing with if hes infected he could spread itwhat we need now is control toronto one way yes now once we harvestthe blood from the insect the toxins theyre moving into my brainjust like it did on the prisoners i dont have much longer i need you to help me what do you want me to do go on you have to complete the test why did you confide in me its not a secret i feel like taking to the grave people have a right to knowthe danger we put them in if your test comes back negativeyou have to tell them how can i prove it i dont know but if you dont itll just happen again dont believe for a secondthat this is an isolated incident your attention pleasebus

id seriously reconsiderbringing this to the media the public should knowso it doesnt happen again youre gonna prove this conspiracywith an empty package and a dead insect  leave it alone the epidemic was contained 18 people are dead and if youre helping them cover the truthyoure just as guilty as they are you really have no ideawho youre dealing with do you i thought i was dealing with you  we cant prove a thing theyve made sure what are you talking about the costa rican government faxed methe report on the missing scientist his name was robert torrencethe same as our prisoner it was their failsafe in case it came to thisthey could blame it on a simple postal error a mistake hmm thats why we were given this assignmentright they knew all along so that even if we succeeded in findingthe truth wed be discredited as part of it am i right  am i right you never had a chance agent mulder  for every step you take theyre three ahead where do you stand i stand right on the linethat you keep crossing come on lets go agent mulder im saying this as a friend watch your back this is just the beginning i made this
