icelandic peridotite naturally  when i saw this i stopped chipping  phone rings  mulder  areyou watching channel eight  whats your conclusion  science does not jump to conclusions  science is not a guessing game  reporter where a 60mile highspeed car chase  ended early this evening  the suspect eluding capture by leaping into the harbor  but not before injuring several ardis police officers  we have captain roy lacerio standing by  how was the man able to escape  and how seriously injured were the officers involved  those details are still unclear  ill be talking with several  im sorry youll have to excuse me  captain roy lacerio being pulled away here  during an intense manhunt  lacerio being pulled away here  during an intense  mulder youve been through this tape 1 00 times  what exactly areyou hoping to find  mulder i dont know  and all he told you  was to watch channel eight  yeah thats all he said  do we even know why the suspect  was being chased  as far as i can tell  he wouldnt pull over for a moving violation  well that should put him  on the ten most wanted list  there must be something here  some detail  were not seeing  how doyou know hes notjustyanking your chain  well he has admitted lying toyou  he wouldnt call ifthere wasnt something here  something he wants me to see  then what areyou missing  there were three law enforcement agencies  out here last night  hunting a man on a moving violation  i know its not silence ofthe lambs  but its what we do  this man isnt wearing a badge or a uniform  hes not one ofyours  no sir  but it was a zoo out here  you say the suspect was shot  why hasnt the body been recovered  we got our search ongoing  were quite certain he will be found  its been almost 1 8 hours captain  where could the body be  there are cables and debris all over the bottom  its a painstaking business  can i askwhat the fbis interest in this case  would be  the suspect matches the description  ofa federal fugitive  really hows that  no description ofthe suspect has been released  ifyou dont mind can we take a look  at the car please  its been taken to impound  the report says that the car was registered  to a rental agency in gaithersburg  they had no idea the carwas even missing  you know mulder  i think that were wasting our time here  i dont know what the hell im supposed to find  you cant make out the license plate in this photo  scully look at this  what  look at the car in the photo  look at the windshield  its not the same car  scully its called a caduceus  its the adopted symbol  ofthe medical profession  so probably only a doctor would have that on his car  mmhmm  i had the picture enhanced  the plate is different  3 ayf  fastforward  thats all you can make out  the rest is obscured  hey danny its mulder  run a maryland plate for me  all i got is a partial  registered to a doctor or used to be  yeah ill hold  they switched cars and lied about it  whywould they do that  maybe the real owner ofthe car has something to hide  animal squeals  mulder dr berube  yes  were with the fbi  can we have a minute  im very busy  areyou aware that a car registered toyou  was involved in a highspeed chase  in ardis yesterday  excuse me  a silver ciera doctor  doyou own one  yes  it was used forwhat  a crime  wereyou aware it was even missing  not until now  i have a housekeeper and she often uses the car  its a second car  please  they should not be excited  nothing should be touched  i thought theywere friendly  theyre part ofan experiment  what kind  am i under  some kind ofsuspicion  no  then i

no  no what doyou mean  this has reached the point ofabsurdity  were out here on halfa hunch  offa cryptic phone call  chasing down a clue thats based on speculation  well thats all weve got  thats all hes given us  who is this deep throat character  we dont know anything about him  hes in a delicate position  he has access to information  and indiscretion could expose him  you dont know that this isntjust a game  hes toying with you  rationing out the facts  you think he does it because he gets offon it  no i think he does it becauseyou do  calling it a night  mr mulder  my mother usually likes me home  before the street lights come on  im surprised atyou  why  your level ofcommitment seems to have diminished  my level ofcommitment  i expected thatyoud be working through the night  putting the pieces together  maybe ifyoud given me something more to workwith  ive given you all i can  a news report  and where has it led you  not very far  it may be further than you realize  this has always been on your terms  ive been the dutiful son  this time we canjust cut out the obi wan kenobi crap  and save me the trouble  i fearyouve become too dependent on me  look ive got plenty to do  without chasing down yourvague leads  or trying to decode your circular logic  maybe its you whos become too dependent on me  on mywillingness to playyour games  mr mulder  what  dont give up on this one  trust me  youve never been closer  closer to what  door opening  hello  hello  whos there  working late tonight doctor  what doyou want here  hes alive isnt he  has he contacted you  please  youre going to have to leave  banging cage violently  ifyoure from the fbi  ive already answered all your questions  what questions  i had nothing to say to them  i have nothing to say toyou  wheres doctor secare  i dont know whatyoure talking about  please  mywork is very important  i must get on with mywork  im afraid  yourwork is done  loud shattering equipment falling  anybody see anything  no  nothing  im calling it off  lets get those guys out ofthe water  yes sir bring it in  scully the county sheriffs office is conducting the investigation  on the preliminary reports  its being listed as a suicide  suicide  they think that forwhatever reason  he trashed his lab and then killed himself  how  he tied one end ofa roll ofmedical gauze  around his neck  and the other end to this gas outlet  then hejumped  were there anywitnesses  nope  he kept this place  iike he was waiting for the people  from good housekeeping to show up  i would never have pegged him to do this  or a greg louganis out the window  scully i know that gauze is troubling  its a bit too calculated huh  as ifsomeone wanted to make doubly sure  hed break his neck before he hit the ground  what else do we know about dr berube  um  terrence allen berube  harvard med 1 974  he was working  on the human genome project  areyou familiar with that  yeah the mapping ofall human genes  maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor  in the history ofmankind  theres nothing extraordinary about that  there were thousands ofscientists  working on that project  but only one who owned a silver ciera  and went bungeejumping  with medical gauze wrapped around his neck  im seeing the pieces  but im not seeing the connection  mulder maybe thatsjust it  maybe were not seeing it  because it cant be seen not in any obvious way  what is this  i dont know  can you find out  what will you do  ill see what else i can find out about dr berube  okay mulder but im warning you  ifthis is monkey pee youre on your own  doorbell rings  my first impression is  its some kind ofbacteria specimen  can i askyou whereyou got it  it was recovered at a crime scene  weve come a long way  from colonel mustard in the den with a rope havent we  im expecting  it will turn out to be nothing  no youve definitely got something here  wow look at this  scully what are they  theyre the size ofbacteria  but no bacteria ive ever seen  how doyou mean  well most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth  these are  i dont know its strange  you have no way ofidentifying them  well we could do a freeze fracture  take a thin slice off  and see whats going on inside these babies  ifyou dont mind waiting  no no ill wait  hi danny yeah its mulder again  look ive got a number this time   i need an address a name ifyou can get it for me  all right im at uh  same prefix 1 51 7  all right thanks danny  ringing  mulder that was fast  mans voice terry is thatyou  yeah  whos this  they shot me terry  oh god  ive been in the water for three

answer me  what is the problem  come in please  telephone ringing  mulder  its me  hes alive scully  who  the driver ofthe silver ciera  he called the doctors house  where is he now  i dont know where areyou  im at the georgetown microbiology department  ive got something foryou  is it smaller than a silver ciera  much  and its not silver its green  what is it  some kind ofbacteria each containing virus  berube may have been cloning them  they also contain something that looks like chloroplasts  plant cells  theyve never seen anything like it  what could he have been doing with them  the only reason you clone a virus inside a bacteria  is to inject it into something living  its called gene therapy  and its still highly experimental  maybe thats what he was doing with those monkeys  can they tell you anything else  theyrejust about to run some primary cell cultures  and a dna sequence  now i may be understating the strangeness ofthis mulder  bacteria like this  it may have existed but not for millions ofyears  not since before our ancestors first crawled out ofthe sea  areyou there mulder  yeah  scully keep up the good work  agent scully  oh dr carpenter i fell asleep  ive done some work  these are the dna sequences  from the bacteria sample you brought in  you know something about molecular biology  what areyou looking at  i think those are genes  right theyre called base pairs  each pair is made up  ofsomething called a nucleotide  only four nucleotides exist in dna four  and through some miracle ofdesign  that we haveyet to fathom  every living thing is created  out ofthese four basic building blocks  whatyoure looking at is a sequence ofgenes  from the bacteria sample  normally wed find no gaps in the sequence  but with these bacteria we do  why is that  i dont know why  but i tell you under any other circumstances  my first call would have been to the government  what exactly did you find  a fifth and sixth dna nucleotide  a new base pair  agent scully  whatyou are looking at  it exists nowhere in nature  it would have to be by definition  extraterrestrial  ringing  hello  mulder where on gods earth haveyou been  ive been trying to call you all night  i had a situation  i left my phone in the car  mulder  that bacteria i had analyzed  theyre saying that it doesnt exist in nature  theyre saying that it could be extraterrestrial  scully  what  how soon can you be here  theres something i gotta showyou  wait a second  mulder  i just want to say that i was wrong  thats all right dont worry about it  no um  ifyoud have listened to me we wouldnt be here right now  i should know by now to trustyour instincts  why nobody else does  you know ive always held science  as sacred  ive always put my trust in the accepted facts  and what i saw last night  for the first time in my life i dont know what to believe  whatever it is you do believe scully  when you walk into that room  nothing sacred will hold  there were tanks here  and five bodies suspended in solution  there were computers monitoring them  theywere alive scully underwater  what happened to them  god only knows  most likely  theyve been destroyed  miss scully  we met ever so briefy  destroyed bywhom  i dont know  i dont believeyou  there are limits to my knowledge  mr mulder  inside the intelligence community  there are socalled black organizations  groups within groups conducting covert activities  unknown at the highest levels ofpower  there were three men i was chased  ifyou were chased you would have been killed  those men are trained well  for that sort ofbusiness  were those the same men  who killed dr berube  presumably  why  why good lord  youve worked so hard  and you still dont see it  dr berube was conducting human experiments  with extraterrestrial viruses  yes but thats been going on foryears  weve had the tissue since 1 947  but not the technology  roswell  roswell was a smoke screen  weve had a halfa dozen better salvage operations  dr berube was killed  because his work was too successful  youre standing in the room  where the first dna transplant took  the first humanalien hybrid was created  six volunteer patients  all terminally ill  one dr william secare an old friend  of dr berubes  was dying ofmelanoma cancer  and as a result  ofthe et gene therapy  all six patients treated in this room  began to recover from their illnesses  dr secare was able to live  a more or less normal life  as normal as possible  for a man who has developed inhuman strength  and the ability to breathe underwater  thats how he eluded capture  what was he running from  dr secare was never supposed to have survived  dr berubes research was part  ofa top secret government project  all theywere interested in was the technology  to have a hybrid living out in the real world  too great a liability  what ifhe should need  emergency medical procedure  the man has a blood chemistry  that is alien  and very likely toxic  that story should hit the press  it was easier to kill dr secare  ofcourse  there was only one problem  dr berube was able to warn him  theresjust one thing i dont understand  whyyou gave us so little to go on in the beginning  and why areyou giving us so much now  i didnt anticipate the speed and precision  oftheir cleanup operation  theyre systematically destroying all the evidence  dr berube the bodies here  without the evidence  you two have no case  who would believe the story  i just told you  you must put together  everything thatyou have found  and you must find dr secare before they do  ill have no further contact with you on this matter  im going to get back to georgetown  and get all the lab work  im going to find dr secare  where  i dont know im going to trust my instincts  im looking for dr ann carpenter  ive been unable to reach her by phone  and shes not in her office  she was in a terrible car accident  herwhole family  and dr carpenter is um dead  thump  thump  dr secare  wait  ill protectyou  gunshot  air rushes out  ah  coughing  ringing  your cellular phones been ringing offthe hook  im a popular guy  why dontyou answer it for me  oh i dont like talking on the phone  i have this thing about unsecured lines  when you feel like talking  iet me know though  hes not home  where is he  hes been gone all night  i wish i knew  somethings happened to him  theywont kill him  how doyou know that  hes become too highprofile  and youve got evidence that could expose them  they took the evidence  and they may have killed in order to get it  the evidence still exists  where  it might be difficult to obtain  but with your medical background  i might be able to getyou inside  inside where  the highcontainment facility  at fort marlene maryland  what do they have there  the wellspring miss scully  the original tissue  iftheyve got agent mulder  they might be willing to make a deal  it could save his life  click  name  dana scully  company or institution  federal government  project password  project password  purity control  log in please  youre late  doyou have it  yes  good theyre willing  to make the exchange  you spoke to them  yes  ill take the parcel  no sir  ill make the exchange  i made the deal scully  theyre expecting me  i dont trustyou  theres no one else to trust  i dont know whoyou are  i know nothing aboutyou  for gods sake  dont screw this up  in 1 987 a group ofchildren from a southern state  were given what their parents thought  was a routine inoculation  what theywere injected with  was a clone dna  from the contents ofthat package  youre holding as a test  thats the kind ofpeople youre dealing with  so why give it back to them  to save mulders life  at the risk ofother lives  you and mulder are the ones who can bring it to light  now give me the parcel  give me the parcel scully  no  mulder mulder  trust  trust  no one  telephone ringing  hello  mulder hey scully its me  where areyou  theyre shutting us down scully  what  they called me in tonight  and they said  theyre going to reassign us to other sections  who told you that  skinner  he said word came down from the top  ofthe executive branch  mulder  its over scully  lodge a protest they cant  yes they can  what areyou going to do  im  not going to give up  i cant give up  not as long as the truth is out there
