wouldnt feel comfortable  telling the police on the record   this is offthe record  absolutely  what did you see michael  after she left the car  and she was fighting with the cop  i saw her in her clothes and she looked like a  nervous laugh  she looked like a man  she was a man  the club scene used to be so simple  its offthe record  scouts honor  scully we cant rule out  that were looking for
