                growls  dull pop  slow heavy breathing  snapping and cracking  eugene  eugene its dr monte  eugene areyou asleep   no  i was on myway out  and i wanted to see howyou were feeling  fine  good you nervous about tomorrow  dont be  i knowyou think theywont letyou out  so i snuck a peek at the reports ofthe doctors  that will testify atyour review tomorrow  and they concurwith my opinion that youre ready to be released from here  and rejoin the community  so  why dont we get some sleep and relax  and ill seeyou tomorrow at the review okay  letsjust keep our fingers crossed  agent scully  we have reviewed your reports and frankly we are quite displeased  irregular procedure untenable evidence  inconclusive findings aggravated byvague opinion  but sir the very nature ofthe xfiles cases  often precludes orthodox investigation  areyou suggesting the bureau adopt separate standards foryou and mulder   no sir  you suggesting mulder obstructs you from proper procedure  no sir ifanything im suggesting  that these cases be reviewed with an open mind  maybeyour mind has become too open  on xfiles cases investigated by agent mulder and myselfto date  we have a conviction or case solution of75  thats well above current bureau standard  and that is your only saving grace  may i ask sir what moreyou require  what i require  is increased frequency ofreports  conventional investigation  in short agent scully it is your responsibility  to see that these cases are by the book  i understand however  conventional investigation ofthese cases  may decrease rate ofsuccess  gavel pounding  judge by order ofthe state of maryland  the court shall review the psychological status  of eugene victortooms  well begin with the courtappointed expert witnesses  court calls dr pamela karetzky  i performed several diagnostic procedures on mr tooms  in order to determine any organic physiological dysfunction  an electroencephalogram chromosomal analysis  a computerized axial tomograph  all ofthese were negative   mr tooms had recently lost hisjob   parenthesis baltimore animal regulationdog catcher close parenthesis  aggravated by a false arrest incident with the fbi  his assault on agent scullywas  frustration directed at the wrong person  im reading from a recent interview  i did with mr tooms at the druid hill sanitarium  question lfyou are released  what is the first thing you would do  answer id like my oldjob back  question why  answer the animal shelter  made me feel i was helping everyone  people and animals  so you see what is occurring here is that mr tooms has learned  to articulate his feelings and invest his emotional energy  towards creative and constructive activity  no audio  in himself  it is my opinion that mr tooms has had a very excellent response  to the months oftreatment and therapy  i would see no reason why he would be considered  ofany danger to himselfor society  woman is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  i do  mr mulder as an expert witness for the state of maryland can you listyour qualifications  im a special agent with the fbi  i worked for threeyears at the fbis behavioral science unit  profiling serial killers  your honor i know where hes going with this  may i remind the court mr tooms was placed in psychiatric care  solely for the assault on agent scully  he has never been charged nor has any evidence linked him to any other crime  judge proceed with caution  myers agent mulder i understand  thatyouve developed a profile on mr tooms   yes i have  please  these murders span nearly a century  every 30 years since 1 903  all in the baltimore area  in each case the liverwas extracted  and presumably eaten  a trophywas taken from each victim many ofwhich were found  in the living quarters of eugene tooms at 66 exeter street  records show that a eugene tooms has resided  at that same address since 1 903  the sameyear a man was murdered in that building  the most notable element connecting these cases  is the undetermined point ofentry  manyvictims were found with theirwindows and doors locked from the inside  these fingerprints found at seven ofthe 1 9 crime scenes  match eugene victortooms  agent mulder look at his fingers   look at him 1 00 years old  i contend that perhaps  through a genetic mutation tooms is capable ofcontorting  and elongating his body to gain access to victims  so he may extract the livers which provide him sustenance  for the hibernation period of30 years  he needs one more victim to complete this cycle  a preliminary exam revealed abnormalities  in his stride muscles and axial bones  his attorney blocked further study   i askyou to place the safety  no further questions  this is a rare and abnormal human creature who should not be released   you may step down  ifyou release eugene tooms he will kill again  its in his genetic makeup  would they have taken me more seriously ifl wore the grey suit  mulder your testimony you sounded  i dont care how it sounded as long as it was the truth  and where wereyou your testimonywas important  i was called into a meeting byassistant director skinner  what did he want  just wanted to reel me in  theyre ready  it is the opinion ofthis court  that eugene victortooms  shall on this day be released from the druid hill sanitarium  court also attaches these conditions  one that he remain in counseling under the care of dr aaron monte  that he may retain hisjob at the baltimore regulations animal shelter  and last he take residence in the house of mr and mrs arlan green  trained in a program to assist patients released from druid hill  in their transition to society  mr tooms  doyou understand and accept these conditions  yes your honor  verywell youre free to go  im not taking my eyes offhim  hell kill again first chance he can but he wont kill the old couple  tooms didnt remain a secret for 1 00 years by not being careful  think ofhim as an animal he kills out ofnecessity or selfdefense  ifhe makes an attempt ill be there  ill keep surveillance with you  ifhe cant be tied to recent evidence  go to the earlier murders to prove it was him  that was 30 or 60 years ago  theres no statute oflimitation on murder  thats going to entail  unorthodox methods ofinvestigation  ifyoure resistant becauseyou dont believe  ill respect that but ifyoure resistant  because ofbureaucratic pressure theyve not only reeled you in  theyve skinned you  door opening  arlan i hopeyoull be comfortable eugene  the room in the back is small  but im sureyoull be able to squeeze in  tooms im sure  growling and snarling  excuse me  could you help me find my dog  hes a norwegian elkhound  his name is heinrich  i use him to hunt moose  iftooms gets away now  then the next time he takes a life  youll be nearly my age  detective briggs you helped us so much before  now we have to prove that tooms was involved  in the killings you investigated 30 years ago  youve lived with this case halfyour life  there must be something  maybe a connection between the victims  now i know that weve seen all ofthe evidence  but is there anything anything at all  amongst the evidence that does not fit  there was something  that never did sit quite right with me  all ofthe victims that i investigated in 63  were found at the crime scene liver extracted  all five  as were the four most recent murders  when i was a sheriff  during the powhatan mills killings of 1 933  only four ofthe victims were found at the crime scene  however there was a fifth person  who was missing and never found  but this  this was discovered at the ruxton chemical plant  when it was under construction  but it doesnt belong to the othervictims  that doesnt prove it belongs to a person murdered bytooms  im positive tooms hid this one victim  because something about the body could prove he was the killer   what makes you positive  a hunch  an oldfashioned hunch  youve got to trust your instincts  and what does your instinct say  about where tooms buried the body  in the cement where they poured the foundation  ofthe chemical plant  machinerywhirring  scully groundpenetrating radar  it bounces signals off ofobjects or cavities  tells you where the body is  well it signals ifsomething inordinate is present  an experienced operator attempts to differentiate  ifthe signal is a body or a stone or a hole in the ground   differentiate  mmhmm  you mean he guesses  well its an educated guess  mmhmm  how are we doing  well its really hard to tell  its here here  what is it  its here its right here  deep breath  jackhammer hammering  agent scully look at this  computer keyboard clicking  woman robotoddlers finally sleeping  im gonna watch tv in bed  okay  vehicle approaching  baby crying  im coming honey  mommys right here  shh shh  screw it  grunts  knocking  christine honey would you go down and get that  sighs  fbi   i suspect an intruder in your house  what  someone opened mywindow  i suspect theyear ofdeath to be in the mid1 930s  anterior surface ofthe right femurwas green  indicating a longterm exposure to copper  so we concentrated on the area  and we found several pennies   can you determine cause ofdeath  my instinct says that burial in cement is murder  uh no at the moment  i have found no definite proofofmurder  there are gnawing marks near the ribs  however i suspect thats the result ofrodent activity  prior to the body being set in the cement  we need to see much more ofthe remains to determine cause ofdeath  as you know its a slow but necessary process  i did try a little something  its a little premature ifwere going by the book  well well keep it offthe record  good thankyou the old man mr briggs  he gave me a photo ofthe missing person in 33 suspected ofbeing a murdervictim  i ran a computerassisted photographic superimposition on what we have ofthe skull  this is not official  but that skeleton was that person  its not enough it doesnt tie it to tooms  well its a start  mulder its getting a bit ripe in here dontyou think  sniffs  plastic wrapper crinkling  pine scented  sniffs  whew  sniffs better  tooms hasnt come out ofthe house all day  i sat through a phillies game an orioles game and four hours of bababooey  when it got dark i took a walk around the block  doyou have that sandwich i asked you to bring  its liverwurst  haha  mulder you know that proper surveillance  requires two pairs ofagents one pair relieving the other after 1 2 hours  article 30 paragraph 87  this isnt about doing it by the book  this is aboutyou not having slept for three days  youre going to get sloppy and youre going to get hurt  a request for other agents to stake out tooms would be denied  well then ill stay here you go home  sighs  theyre out to put an end to the xfiles scully  i dont know why but any excuse will do  i dont really care about my record  butyoud be in trouble just sitting in this car  and id hate to seeyou carry an official reprimand  in your career file because ofme   fox  chuckles  and l i even made my parents call me mulder  so mulder  mulder i wouldnt put myself on the line for anybody butyou  iftheres an iced tea in that bag could be love  must be fate mulder  root beer  youre delirious go home and get some sleep  here take my sandwich  i only had one bite youre going to want it later  and call me ifanything happens immediately ill be here  oh and 1 1 30 station 790  pete rose late night sports talk radio show  wouldnt miss it for the world  car starts  it has worked hasnt it  youll be all right now i know its worked  screams  yeah they found him out cold in the street  hes been beaten up pretty badly  contusions multiple lacerations  shoulders been pulled right out ofjoint  lets get him prepped for some blood work and x rays  orderly yes doctor  hes been kicked in thejaw  and it may be fractured  look theres a partial shoe print  i want to get a photo ofthat we might be able to find the shoe that matches it later  doyou know who did this toyou  whispering  well be right back mr tooms  says it was an fbi agent named mulder  so would you say hes delusional orjust schizophrenic  well itsjust a cursory exam but theres nothing to indicate that  grunts  knocking  sighs   agent mulder  yeah  whats going on  whats this about  agent mulder getyour things  youre in some trouble  these are serious allegations  the evidence is incriminating  a good forensic scientist would know there is not only a shoe print  but also an impact point ofa foot from inside the shoe  an analysis oftooms injurywould show that my foot was not inside the shoe  areyou suggesting tooms is framing you   ofcourse  ifyou were engaged in an unauthorized  surveillance oftooms  how could he gain access toyour shoe withoutyou seeing him  sir i was engaged  in the unauthorized surveillance as well  and agent mulder was orienting me  on the situation at the time tooms was admitted into the hospital  agent mulder could not have done it because he was with me  agent scully you wouldnt be lying to me would you  sir i would expectyou  to place the same trust in me as i do in you  agent scully may i have a word with agent mulder please  fox  you are one ofthe finest most unique agents  in the nearly 60year history ofthis institution  i mean we were talking aboutyou when you were in the academy  now most ofus feel thatyour talents are wasted on the xfiles  but we respect thatyoure deeply invested in those areas  but ifthese cases are creating such stress  as to cause not onlyyou to act inappropriately  but those agents close toyou as well  then may i adviseyou to step away for a while  clearyour head take an extended vacation  thats a good idea  thanks foryour concern  youre forbidden to go near eugene tooms  mulder  this was close  any closer and a thousand friends at the capitol wont be able to helpyou  scully these are eugene tooms dental x rays  obtained from the druid hills sanitarium  your sandwich gave me an idea  dr plith mentioned he found gnawing  on the rib cage near the location ofthe liver  further excavation revealed more pronounced bite marks  human teeth marks  tooms will nevervoluntarily submit to a dental cast  this software can create an exact threedimensional model  oftooms mouth from the dental radiograph  weve also mapped out the bite marks  on the skeletons rib there  they match  knocking   eugene dr monte  hi eugene  i wanted to see how everything was going  arlan susan and i are going out for the evening  thanks  great place
